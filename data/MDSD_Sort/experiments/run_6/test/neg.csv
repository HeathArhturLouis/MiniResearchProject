 This is a good product - sounds great, gets good battery life, everything you'd hope for in an iPod dock.  But it has one major flaw.  The iPod docking port is really flimsy, and has no structural support aside from the actual electronics themselves.  After a little bit of use, the connection between the iPod and the dock deteriorated to the point that the volume fluctuated up and down, and sometimes the sound cuts out all together.  If they added some kind of simple support so that bumping the iPod wouldn't stress the electronics, I'd give this thing 5 stars.  But without that, it simply breaks quickly, and no longer performs its only job - to sound good. 
 I bought this as a replacement for my stowaway when I replaced my Palm m105 with an HP IPAQ. The palm-stowaway combination was an excellent portable alternative to my laptop and I used in nearly every day.  After my positive experience I expected my new IR keyboard to function the same way.  What a dissapointment! I can forgive the large size of the keyboard but there are several aspects of this keyboard that have made it intolerable to me. I found the keys did not always respond leaving me with multiple errors to fix in every paragraph and the split space bar has been a constant source of irritation, I usually hit the solid piece of plastic in the middle instead of one of the keys.  The little plastic arms on the stand do not hold the PDA at all securely, even bumping the table can knock it off, and I have taken to using an elastic band to keep my IPAQ in place. The "mouse" arrowpad is a nice idea but does not justify the loss of the arrow keys. Finally the backlight does not stay on while using the keyboard and there is no backlight control on the keyboard (unlike the stowaway). I will be replacing this keyboard with another after a much more careful search 
 This bookstand, despite the description, is not suitable for heavy books. If you put heavy books on this, the stand that props up the whole unit is likely to snap off. 
 i've met bands like this before. they sing classical arias and perform in stage productions at college and harrass the ones of us who like to smoke and sing out of tune but maybe write a good song or two. sometimes a local bar band that plays a lot of power chords hooks up with one of these guys and says, "he sings like maynard but he has a sound of his own", meaning he sucks compared to maynard. once again this production is very crass and efficient...just big eq, auto tune and not much else. very simple songs, very boring. the vocalist has decent range, granted, but even superb vocalists like robert plant and maynard realize that there has to be great material to begin with 
 Right from the start I have had problems with this coffee marker.  The timer/clock loses about 5 minutes a day so I'm always resetting the time to the correct time so that the automatic start feature will work.  The lid on the thermos leaks during brewing. Which means coffee spills everywhere including on the maker which also shuts the coffee marker off. So I end up with coffee everywhere and have to wait hours before I can even think of using the marker again.   I have owned the coffee maker for less than 30 days and I think I will be looking for a replacement tomorrow 
 As an active duty chaplain in the military I had a significant interest in chapter 9, Priests and Padres.  First, I was amazed at the number of references and her ability to read, organize, and synthesize them into a narrative.  These references, however, are derived from a significant number of ministers writings or sermons, which became the framework for her conclusions.  Furthermore, multiple references, representing several wars, are devoid of their cultural-historical context and woven into one sentence or paragraph leaving the reader to think the behavior, concept, or issue is timeless and characteristic of clergy.  I don't consider the chapter a valid historical analysis because of the limitations of the source material.  What the chapter does provide is a summary of her sources convictions and behaviors-which is not the whole story.  Since I considered her conclusions in chapter 9 highly subjective I did not read the rest of the book 
 This book, up to the very end was very good. With out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half.  The end is what ruins the entire thing. Don't worry I'm not going to spoil anything. I'll just say the ending stinks out loud!  This story is not really horror, its SiFi. A adventure/drama/SiFi. It really should have been about 100 to 200 pages longer. Everything in it was really cool and fun to read but it just seemed rushed. And somethings were not really dove into thoroughly enough. The writting was dead on as always and character development was good.  This book just needed another couple hundred pages to go from a barley average book to a great book 
 Sir Leycester Coltman was Head of the Foreign Office's Latin America Department, then Ambassador to Cuba (1991-94), then to Colombia (1994-98). But as this mean-minded book shows, this hardly qualified him to write `the real' biography of Fidel Castro.   This book gives the Foreign Office view, brimming with anti-trade union, anti-national and anti-communist sneers. For example, he casts doubts on Fidel's brother's parentage, citing as evidence Raul's `slanted oriental eyes', but even the book's photos disprove this.   Coltman patronisingly assumes that Britain can give lessons in democracy to Cuba, but how many of us voted Mandelson an EU Commissioner? Coltman smugly assumes that capitalism means progress, but capitalism, a mode of production, does not make technological innovations or scientific advances: the working class makes them all. He cannot describe US imperialism and the illegal US blockade without putting the offending words in inverted commas.  He claims that the Macmillan government's decision to sell the Cuban dictator Batista warplanes and tanks was `commercial rather than political', because Britain's economic situation was `desperate'.  When Macmillan refused to sell Hawker Hunter fighters to Castro to defend Cuba against imminent US aggression, the situation was presumably not so desperate. Kennedy's illegal assault on Cuba showed that Bush's practice of unilateral, aggressive war is nothing new.  Cuba's eight million people have sustained independence and sovereignty, repelling all efforts to interfere in their internal affairs. So Fidel rightly opposed the Sandinistas' 1989 decision to bow to US-EU demands to hold multi-party elections in Nicaragua: the Sandinistas even let the US government fund the opposition.   He warned, "Some people think they can save socialism by making concessions. They fail to take account of the voracious mentality of imperialism and of the reactionary forces. If you give them part of a fingernail, they will want part of your finger; if you give them a piece, they will want the whole finger; if you give them the finger, they will ask for the forearm; if you give them the forearm, they will ask for the arm; and when you give them the arm, they will chop off your head."  
 I guess we can thank the global population for making Rob Schneider a  leading actor by continually buying tickets to that Deuce Bigalow fiasco.  I could only sit through about thirty minutes of that before my head started to hurt and my eyes started to burn.  I guess I have sheer boredom or desperation to thank for actually watching this abysmal feature about a thief who finds a magical earring, which transforms him into a blonde teenager overnight.  This body transforming-opposite sex switcharoo has been done time and time again, but not this badly.  If the dwarf size Schneider makes you laugh because he looks like he's been on a narcotics binge for months on end, you might like this film.  I can cut the guy some slack because the script is so horrible that it would be hard for Lawrence Olivier to be convincing.    The majority of scenes intended to make you laugh are physical bits that aren't remotely funny.  Girls having pillow fights where Schneider overpowers them and sends them flying through the air with each blow (literally), the standard overweight character that dances sexy even though it's the most vile thing you've ever seen.  Schneider falling down bleachers, smashing his face against every seat, a cross dressing eight-year-old boy...  Adam Sandler has been stealing money for years because this same movie going public has made him a superstar.  He makes a cameo, talks so low you can't understand a word he's saying and wears quite possibly the worst wardrobe ever assembled by a costume designer.  Two things make this film at least worth watching if you're as mind numbingly bored and desperate as I was last night:  1)  Whoever the Foley Artist was for this film should never work again.  Pillows making contact, Schneider falling down, rear end slapping..it's all the same sound.  It's exactly like someone stood on a third story balcony and dropped a suitcase full of bowling balls onto the street below.  (2) Anna Faris...I can't decide whether I think she's really cute or if she's just a Plain Jane with large eyes...but when I'M thinking she's pretty cute, she's nice to look at.  
 this hippy master of CHEESE made my middle years a living HELL with his horrid M.O.R. sap toons! How can ANYONE actually praise these corntastic AM gold leftovers from an era that had some REAL music  going on? This is like putting AIR SUPPLY over the BEATLES as a GREAT ROCK BAND---wake up America! 
 GWTW certainly was one-sided in its portrayal of the Old South, and I can see how that could be a deal killer for a lot of readers.  Although I consider GWTW to be one of the greatest pieces of American literature ever written, I was VERY excited by the idea of TWDG.  The idea of building a "back story" around the black characters in Mitchell's novel is BRILLIANT!  So much could be done with this idea to address issues of race and slavery, as well as to broadside a popular piece of American literature through counterpoint.  Unfortunately, this great idea is wasted because Randall is utterly lacking in talent.  The thing that immediately bothered me about TWDG is the extraordinarily poor use of dialect.  One sentence has the main character narrating in perfect grammar with strong vocabulary and then in the next sentence she's all "he do dat" and "me go sleep."  Randall should have picked one voice for her main character and stuck with it.  This alone represents terrible hack writing, but I must go on and say something about the (snicker) "plot."  The plot, which should be subversive and controversial, fails to rise above the trashy romance novel level, and the (I think they're supposed to be shocking) sex scenes wouldn't shock anyone except my Amish Aunt Minnie.  I actually laughed out loud several times as I read them because I pictured Clark Gable/Rhett Butler saying some of this ridiculous dialogue.    The plot here is so flaccid that Randall inadvertently undermines her own book.  The white characters remain more interesting than any of the black characters.  This despite the fact Randall gives them tons of dirty linen to air in an obvious (and pathetic) attempt to make them interesting.  Her black characters are non-entities, which I believe was her beef with Mitchell in the first place....right?!   As a result, by writing TWDG, Randall is only spray painting a nasty word on the castle walls of GWTW when what she needed to do was bulldoze the original, dance gleefully on its grave, and create something very powerful in its place.  But that would take a skilled writer, and Randall just doesn't have the goods.  "Taking on" GWTW is a great idea, especially to stir up discussion around issues of racism and slavery in our country and our history.  However, to do an idea like that justice requires a talented author (i.e., not Alice Randall).  Maybe Toni Morrison should take this on?  I'd read that 
 Not as well written as I'd like, with kind of dull descriptions.  It's a chronicle of a girl's experience in foster homes, after her mother murders a boyfriend for a bad breakup.  Other reviewers have mentioned that the narrative voice is not convincing as coming from a teenaged girl.  I have to agree.  Also, the ending was forced and saccharine.  I thought, after all that, that there would be some lingering damage, but no, the perky heroine lifts herself up and is apparently fine.  Or maybe Oprah just likes a happy ending?  (The movie ending is a little different, not much better. 
 Frankly I think this 3rd edition should be pulped.  The 2nd edition was authoritative and prescriptive.  If I want to hear or read how people speak now, I only need to refer to my graduate students.  I don't think we need a book that validates the continuing decline of the language 
 I'm going to start this off by saying that I am NOT the biggest Andrew Lloyd Webber fan.  Some of his works are amazing, like Joseph and various songs from each of his musicals, yet overall he tries to incorporate a very fake sounding pop opera into most of his shows.  Unfortunately, The Woman in White, his first try at gothic opera, is even worse. Webber obviously tried to pretend that the score for the musical was quality, thought-provoking work by jam-packing it with dissonant chords and loud orchestrations, but they only show how little he truly knows about music.  Half of the show's score is little short of random notes that seem to have no connection (almost as if he tried to imitate the genius of Sondheim).  The tunes are bland, the book is boring and confusing, and many of the performances are sub-par.  For instance, the actrees portraying the Woman in White simply shrieks throughout the entire CD.  Even when she sings, her screaming din hurts one's ears.  It seems as if she decided to cover the underdevelopment of her character with noise.  The other actors are generally adequite, yet they have so little to work with that their portrayals seem dull. Admittedly, there are some highlights to this CD, such as Crawford's amazing portrayal of Count Fosco (especially the live version of You Can Get Away With Anything...it is HILARIOUS!), but overall, the CD is hard to take in.  Some songs are quite beautiful, yet the track on which they resign are also full of shrieking, dull dialogue, and loud music.  I think it is a tell-tale sign of a flop when on a live-version CD of a musical, only one song is accompanied by reaction from the audience 
 This shaker is a piece of garbage.  For starters, the shipper sends it to you in the retail box with no padding.  If that doesn't ensure that the shaker will be bent when it gets to you, you'll wish that it was, because the shaker is worthless.  The 'stainless' steel is rusting after only 2 months, and the shaker top is infuriatingly impossible to remove, because it sits inside the 24 oz. resevoir.  I'm getting the high-rated Ultimo 24-ouncer and sending this one to the Chinese junk heap where it belongs.  Better yet, back to the seller for a refund on the 'lifetime warranty' 
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me. The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime. The problem is, they didn't. There is no crime. I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense. It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation. 
 I read this short novel because I greatly admired Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning "Killer Angels," and because I'm a baseball fan.  The novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher.  It's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot.  The characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.  The feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there.  Any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away, flaws that distract and damage the work.  Shaara sets most of the novel in Yankee Stadium with the Hawks playing the Yankees.  Why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear.  The Hawks apparently are from Atlanta, but an Atlanta team, Braves or Hawks, whichever, would not be playing the Yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season.  Finally, when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game, he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in Yankee Stadium--not on the mound on the field.  This book was published posthumously and Mr. Shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose--prose that was excellent in "Killer Angels."  It's unfortunate.  There are glimmers of interest in the book, but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author's other book 
 This movie added a world war, changed the continent the story took place on, and then brought the dead back to life. To me, once the essential elements of the author's story are that fundamentally altered, it's not fair to use the title anymore. I realize a number of the changes are a 'tribute' to the Shirley Temple version, but I'd hoped that since the new version wasn't a star vehicle they might have returned to more of the original storyline, but no. At least the first movie was on the correct continent! I like the movie, believe it or not, but it's not the story I read until the first book fell apart, and the changes to the story I listed weren't necessary, and it may have been nice to see that things can work out even when a parent stays dead 
 I sent Amazon.com two different checks at two different times to purchase this CD and a DVD from one of those so called sellers.  I have bought new stuff from Amazon.com before, but this time I wanted to try and buy stuff from one of those sellers since Amazon.com did not have any of those items that I wanted in new.  I contacted Amazon a long time ago requiring one of my checks, and was told that they did not know anything about it. Then, I contacted them again recently, but was told that the seller(s) did something illegle, so I will not be getting my items.  I was told that since I sent checks, I will not be getting any refunds from Amazon.com.  I made both of my checks to Amazon.com and sent it to their address, so I thought since they forwarded my payments to that person or them, they were responsible for my payements.  I tell you what, I will never do business with Amazon.com ever agian from now on 
 This book is a review of research concerning heart disease, cholesterol, and diet.  The author makes little attempt to be objective, and pushes continually for his opinion that research to date has not been able to prove conclusively that a diet high in cholesterol leads to heart disease.  In the beginning of the book, he carefully lays out the logic for the reader, separating the main hypotheses concerning cholesterol so that he can then bring each into question in turn.  For Ravnskov, the main hypotheses are: "a high-fat diet leads to high cholesterol levels in the blood" and "high cholesterol levels in the blood lead to arteriosclerosis and heart attacks."  He also examines related hypotheses of perhaps lesser importance, such as "lowering your cholesterol level with lengthen your life" or "polyunsaturated oils are good for you".  Each chapter begins with a description of what Ravnskov terms a "myth" concerning cholesterol or heart disease, which Ravnskov then counters with a critical analysis of the research purported to prove the claim contained in the "myth".    Ravnskov points out a fair number of problems with the classic studies concerning heart disease and cholesterol.  These problems range from the way in which the studies were conducted, to who was studied, to how the results were interpreted.  One odd point that he mentions repeatedly is that in some studies, researchers "chose" to use a "less-rigorous" one-tailed t-test when seeking statistical significance when they should have been held to the "more rigorous" two-tailed t-test.  Now I'm no statistician, but from what I remember of t-tests, it's not that one type is more rigorous than the other, but that one is appropriate for certain purposes and the other is appropriate for others, and you never really have a choice about which one to use-you just have to choose the one that fits the type of question you are trying to quantify.  So do any of Ravnskov's criticisms of statistical methods hold water?  I'm not sure.  When criticizing the work of others, Ravnskov pays quite a bit of attention to questions of statistical significance, but unfortunately, when making his own claims, Ravnskov often omits little things like p-values.  A friend of mine read this book and was quite taken with Ravnskov's contention that the body makes its own cholesterol, so if you eat foods high in cholesterol it doesn't have to make as much than if you avoid cholesterol-laden foods.  This friend has been a vegetarian for twenty years and is very physically active, but she still has a moderately high cholesterol level.  She figured that if Ravnskov were right, the reason why her cholesterol level is high might be because she doesn't eat meat, so if she were to switch to eating a lot of meat, her cholesterol would stay the same or perhaps even go down. A month-long trip to Mongolia, where she would have to subsist on a mostly mutton diet, gave her the chance to test these ideas.  Before she left for Mongolia, she had her cholesterol tested-240 mg.  In Mongolia, she kept her active lifestyle, but ate mostly mutton, which contains the most cholesterol of all red meats.  As soon as she got back from Mongolia, she had her cholesterol tested again.  Instead of staying the same or going down, it was up to 280 mg.  Hmmm...perhaps there's something to the preponderance of scientific research after all.  Ravnskov would probably explain away the result by saying that cholesterol measurements can vary widely, or perhaps that this woman has a genetic predisposition for high cholesterol.  But the experiment was enough to convince my friend that at least for her own body, a high-cholesterol diet will raise her blood cholesterol.  However, she's not brave enough to test the second part of Ravnskov's claim: that there's no link between high blood cholesterol and heart disease.  She's back to her vegetarian diet with a vengeance, and her cholesterol is back to 240 mg again.  Ravsnkov seems to have potentially valid criticisms of all of the major studies concerning cholesterol and heart disease.  But still, it's hard to see how ALL the research could be wrong, when there is such a large body of it, and it all points in the same direction.  Ravnskov hasn't been able to come up with a single piece of research that argues strongly for a non-connection or shows no linkages.  (He notes of course, that logically speaking, he doesn't need to do so; he need only show that the other arguments were invalid.)  He concedes that people with a genetic propensity for high cholesterol do indeed have higher rates of heart disease, so I'm thinking that perhaps that might be true for the rest of us as well.  Meanwhile, perhaps the greatest value of this book is in its identification of and citations to the major studies in the field.  Study the references section carefully, then go read the original papers yourself before you make up your mind.  (Unfortunately, the references aren't listed in standard bibliographic form, but Ravnskov usually provides enough information in his extensive endnotes to allow readers to scout out the original papers. 
 Here's an example of the quality of work you'll find in this book: P.140: "Romerstein (the author) pointed out that (Alger) Hiss was an agent not of KGB (NKVD) but of military intelligence (GRU). P.512: (Regarding the Order of the Red Star) "Several NKVD agents who served in the United States during the war received this honor, including...Alger Hiss. So which is it, guys? Please try to keep your unsubstantiated accusations straight. The whole point of this book is to establish that the Venona Secrets (material from the Soviet Archives) prove the guilt of many of those accused of spying in the United States on behalf of the U.S.S.R. So, according to the authors, the Venona Secrets "are the details of the spying activities" of Hiss and others. Here is the one and only thing the authors provide in reference to Venona and Hiss: 1. One of the transcripts indicates that an agent known as "Ales" had attended the Allied Conference at Yalta in 1945 and had then flown to Moscow.  2. Hiss had been at the Yalta Conference and then flown to Moscow. 3. Therefore, (p.136) "one sees clearly that "Ales" was Alger Hiss.  Sorry guys, Hiss was innocent, but you can keep trying if it makes you happy 
 This book is atrocious.  It is THE worst book I have read in the last decade.  A 10 year old could have done better. The plot gets more ridiculous as the book progresses, the characters act unbelievably and it is amazing that someone can actually get paid to write such garbage.  The only plus was that I got it out of the library and didn't pay for it 
 This particular edition of Bourke's book (I have not checked other editions) exhibits a complete failure of editing.  The subject matter itself is fascinating, but the missing segments and/or pages makes it extremely difficult to maintain flow.  So far there have been a number of instances of editing failure: on page 2 the last word is not finished on the following page and the text is interrupted.  The same thing happens on pages 3, 14, 15, 16, 44, and 88.  These are only the discrepancies I can identify.  I have no idea how much text is actually missing.  All told, don't buy this edition 
 The story begins with two College guys who just came back from Mexico with Spanish Fly which they plan to sale to their college friends. They want to see if it works so they stumble along a Strip Joint and decide to test it out their. Little do they know they just stumble into a den of Ghouls who feed on human flesh. Ken Foree and Kelly Hu character are both under cover there to find the queen of these beasts and stop them. Well soon after they arrive the Ghouls unveil themselves and the feast begins. The whole story focuses around this strip joint and goes no futher. It has ok acting and pretty good effects. It more of a humorous type horror with  a thin plot. I was expecting  a little more from this film so I gave it only two stars. It might get three if they develop the story better but it really lacks in a lot of departments. I suggest you rent this one before laying down your cash. I was kind of disapointed .     
 Only 8 tracks and some of them real soppy..don't waste your time or money 
 I just returned from amsterdam and I brought some internet materials that I printed out (different articles) and two guide books, I never looked at this one while I was there.  I dont think it has a lot of really useful information, there just arent a lot of details provided - it feels like it tries to cover too much.   My advice would be to decide on what you are interested in doing there: walking, museums, biking... and find for a book that is more directly related to what you are looking for. I feel I wasted my money on this book 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 As a child, my mother had several LOTR posters produced sometime during the 1970's, first wave Tolkien craze.  The paintings in them were some of the most bizarre, highly stylized images I had ever seen, and captured my imagination to this day.  I never saw Middle Earth depictions by the same individual again, until 25 yrs later and I was flipping through this book on clearance at a bookstore.  It's mostly schlock, your typical "Enchanted World" series, Narnia calendar fodder, and I was just about to put it down when I came across those drawings that had enthralled me all those years ago.  They were done by a man named Cor Blok, a Dutch artist who had conceived of his work as something like The Bayeaux Tapestry.  Never have I seen such an accurate portrayal of Tolkien's vision.  Tolkien was trying to create a mythology for our time, and Blok's art is the visual representation of this mythology.  LOTR is not a comic book, it's a saga for the ages.  Blok has given a face to these writings with a timeless allure like no other 
 Give her credit; at least she manages one decent track on an album on occasion. Here, it is the title track. "Cuts Both Ways" wasn't one of her biggest hits, only reaching #44, but it was at least sincere sounding. The utterly nothing song "Don't Wanna Lose You" was heard on the radio a lot, and it didn't deserve it. It is trite and empty, like the vast majority of her music. Absolutely nothing there! This album was also where the marketing of Estefan as a solo performer was at a transitional stage. On the cover, only her name appeared, but on the spine, it had "& Miami Sound Machine" still attached to it. Her early recordings as vocalist with that group are still her best, even though they are hardly brain stimulators themselves, at least they had some energy and were rather fun, in particular "Falling In Love" and "Bad Boy". Both of these have been ignored on subsequent collections, for no apparent reason other than Sony's not caring about completeness, something they have long been known for. Estefan is not totally worthless as a recording artist (I always contend that even the WORST acts have one or two good songs in their catalogs), but she's pretty damn close to being the female equivalent of Billy Joel. (Well, not THAT bad, actually. 
 very cute but have a funky balance, wobly and on the verge of falling over. not comftorable. poorly designe 
 This is a book in the genre of Mein Kampf and The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  An unapologetic smashmouth racist tome that revels and celebrates hatred and fear and is sure to provide supremacist groups with a wonderful volume to treasure and keep on the shelf.  I feel sad when I see that this book will clearly be used to indoctrinate and "teach" people how to hate and fear other people.  Raspail's central thesis is that white people should be nervous because there are a lot of non-white less "desirable" people out there who are coming to peacefully take over their fat, rich lands.  He uses every negative, racist term to describe nonwhites calling them: "turd eaters" and emitting foul stenches etc. etc.  In short, everyone other than whites is a subhuman animal that could be tolerated as long as it doesn't come too near.   The book is a mean spirited, paranoiac Malthusian nightmare of being over-run by "the other" (where the other is a bunch of starving Indians on a convoy).  Fear pervades every page of this book and one finds one actually pitying the revoltingly racist Mr. Raspail simply because of the fever pitched fear that must course through him.    Having read Raspail's odious and despicable work, I find myself wonder what would happen if an ice age descended on Europe and obliterated "Western Civilization" there. How would the North Africans react to flotillas of poor, emaciated Europeans showing up on their relatively warmer shores ?  Would they adopt the attitude that Raspail longs for and attack them or....?  It's clear that Raspail is an imaginative writer. What worries me is the extent to which his work will be used to excuse, shelter, justify and defend pure murderous evil.  
 While the book includes many valid insights, the main idea is way off. The author confuses class with race- when the Jews attained upward mobility they were white, before that they were un-white. Anyone with a minimal  knowledge of American history knows that in this country, the color of  one's skin became the single racial divider, dividing the rich from the  poor as well as the poor from the poor 
 I bought this for my 4 y/o in hopes he would enjoy making sand trucks and then crushing them with his creations.  Unfortunately, even though he loves trucks, he was disinterested in anything this set had to offer except the sand itself!  The set does not come with a sand box or carrying case to keep the toys in so most of the contents of the set cannot be carried together.  I would not recommend this to anyone expecting a set such as the Farm Moon Sand Set. 
 I was so disappointed in this book. I don't find a closeness to God in the pages. Instead it seems intellectual. It contains beautiful sounding prayers that are more like poetry than speaking with God face to face. Even though it contains prayers from across the ages it seems to keep me distant from the personal God I seek. And though the author's prayers are included too, I feel the same about them. I expected more from Richard J. Foster 
 This book was boring; it was a chore to finish. It takes place in Glamorous Hollywood, a bit too glamorous for me. The main character, a lawyer, has a boyfriend she's not too happy with. This book has too many boring pages. This is definitely the last book by this author that I will ever read 
 I was all geeked to watch this but was disapponted...I don't feel lke they picked the right person to direct this movie.  It seemed very empty to me! The fighting scenes were blah and that was what really blew it for me...maybe if it was longer it would have been better?  I don't know...and then there was a mini plot with a brother and sister that SEEMED OUT OF PLACE!!  sigh...Azumi was a much better martial arts sword movie 
 As an academic who loves to shop, I was hoping this would provide a more balanced account of the rise and impact of mass consumerism.  He is certainly right that academics and other relatively privileged strata have something of a knee-jerk animus to mass pleasure.  But the book is a complete failure.  It amounts to little more than a defense brief for mass consumerism--and like a good defense lawyer, he ignores evidence that doesn't fit his case, distorts the arguments of his foes, and offers a rosy, unreal view of his client.  ...

 When I received the book, the first thing I did was flip to the "About the Author" page and I was really pleased to see that Ms. Bacon had both a degree in psychology and a background in law enforcement.  Those things gave me high hopes that the book would contain some real insight and solid information about the on-line dating dynamic that would work alongside the real-life experiences she'd be sharing with the reader.  I was so wrong.  Her introduction was pretty good, however, once she got into the advice and anecdotes the book went straight down hill.  I found her level of social naiveté to be kind of shocking and her inability to understand why someone (both her dates and her readers) would do something, or even view a situation, differently from her personal viewpoint or opinion, downright irritating.  Also, the attempts at humor led me to far more "Huh?" moments than "Ha!" moments.  I think the author was going for wit, but she missed.  What she got was sarcastic and even demeaning to her readers in several places.  I had to force myself to continue past about page 20.  The second half of the book was a bit better than the first, but by then she'd already lost me.  I've read enough on-line ads to know that there are people out there who actually *do* need to be told to post a good picture, use spell checker, don't lie in your ad, and do your best not to sound desperate.  But, if you're beyond that point and looking for a guide that will help you compose a stand-out ad, write follow-up messages that will help you screen out people who aren't for you, get you to the next level with people who are your type, and safely, successfully, negotiate the transition from on-line and e-mail to face-to-face; do yourself a favor and skip this book 
 It is remarkable see the appearance of such a retrograde biography. Nothng new except the cover.  "How many times do we have to hear....?"  Tomaline's work is not really the fruit of research. It rehashes all that Millgrate had covered and leaves out (!!!!) all that has been found of interest since Millgate's biography.  We hear nothing of Hardy's first wife's hatred of him...didn't she leave a multi-volume diary entitled "Why I Hate My Husband"? No, instead Tomaline gives us the wife that made the man a poet. We get nothing of the control freak whose alter ego was "Will Strong," the prinipal character from an unpublished first novel.  Hardy was such a control freak that he wrote his autobiography in the third person (imagine spaking about yourself as "he" and suggesting motives to yourself as though to another!) and then had his second wife publish it in her name after his death to make it seems a biography? There is so much that is newly interesting about the author that it is indeed surprising that Tomalin's rewriting Millgate (by the way, a quite Hardean strategy of overwriting which made his novels palimpsests of notable quotation), made its way to the press.  Same ol' same ol.  Ho hum. 
 Like many books written by academic Christians, this one will be liked or disliked depending on one's political orientation. Conservative Christians will probably disdain it and liberal Christians will probably embrace it. The assumptions are based on Nature and not scripture (although it uses scripture). I wrote a lengthy critique here for those interested:  [...]  For those uninterested, here are four sample quotations which will give you insight into the method of argument:  1) he suggests that to be a "defender of the faith" is not a Christian college's primary purpose (4);   2) that "good education plus biblical studies in an atmosphere of piety" is not what a Christian college exists for (5), and;  3) that "The relation between reason and revelation is therefore in principle no more antithetical than the relation between culture and church" (18).   4) that "Faith is neither a way of knowing nor a source of knowledge" (18).  
 I don't usually do fiction, but have picked up a few excellent reads in that category. This isn't one of the best. For those who prefer nonfiction, and who are seeking a concept of god they can live with in good concscience, check out God Without Relgion by Sankara Saranam. 
 I think that this price is absolutely ridiculous! People dont buy these items for that ridiculous price, they are $3.25 at Walmart and Target. These toys are hard to find at Walmart and Target, but its because these sellers are taking them off the shelfs to rip people off in these sites. If the demand is high they will continue to rip people off. Don't buy from these sellers, and you will begin to find them at your local stores!!!! 
 This book refers to the psychological impact of games, or rather, it tries to. Author Steven Poole even admits to not enjoying playing games, so what business does he have writing a book about them? Somewhat informative, but very dry. Print quality is also average--The pictures look as if they were photocopied in a convenience store 
 This is the type of movie that has me shaking my head and wondering why time, effort and money are invested in such projects while much worthier cinema ideas are left to die 'a'borning'.  Roger Ebert gave this movie three and a half out of four stars.  Although a fan of Ebert's movie reviews in general, I will say that his review of this movie is a good example of why it may be said of his reviews, "When they are good they are very, very good.  But when they are bad they're just terrible."  The child lead, Blake Heron is not accomplished enough for casting in anything more ambitious or sophisticated than a school play and the adults who attempt to support him is this travesty of an attempt at a rite of passage film must have been hanging their heads in embarrassment between takes.  Even the old veteran of such notable efforts as "In the Heat of the Night" and "The Pawnbroker", Rod Steiger is cast as a supportive adult trying to help the young boy (Heron) gain the insight and commitment required to get an abused Beagle pup he has become attached to away from an "old boy" trapper/poacher.  Perhaps Ebert felt some obligation to pay tribute (with a positive review) to any film in which a minor luminary like Steiger might appear but I can't help feeling that his primary responsibility should to the movie going, purchasing and renting public that reads his reviews looking for guidance in making decisions about investing their time and money.   Be advised: this is a stinker and a waste of your time 
 I read this short novel because I greatly admired Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning "Killer Angels," and because I'm a baseball fan.  The novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher.  It's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot.  The characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.  The feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there.  Any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away, flaws that distract and damage the work.  Shaara sets most of the novel in Yankee Stadium with the Hawks playing the Yankees.  Why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear.  The Hawks apparently are from Atlanta, but an Atlanta team, Braves or Hawks, whichever, would not be playing the Yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season.  Finally, when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game, he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in Yankee Stadium--not on the mound on the field.  This book was published posthumously and Mr. Shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose--prose that was excellent in "Killer Angels."  It's unfortunate.  There are glimmers of interest in the book, but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author's other book 
 Vasari's classic text is well written (translated, I guess I should say) but extremely tiresome.  For nearly every artist he simply lists their works, and rarely with more analysis than by describing them as "life-like" or "beautiful."  For example, here is what he says about Titian's Assumption of the Virgin in Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice, one of his most famous and celebrated paintings: "He did a panel for the main altar containing Our Lady ascending into heaven, with the twelve apostles standing below her and watching her ascent, but since this work was painted on canvas and perhaps poorly cared for, little of it can be seen."  That's it.  The only exception to his utter factual tediousness is Michelangelo's Life, where, although he goes into almost no description of the works themselves besides his characteristic fulsomeness, he does provide some interesting anecdotes.  If you are looking to understand and analyze Renaissance art than this book will not help you.  If you are looking to engage in scholarly debate over the origins and documentations of the discussed works then you should probably read the original, unedited version in Italian anyway. 
 I've been a huge Lewis Black admirer for a long time, spending money on concert tickets, books and dvds, and was excited to receive this dvd.  But now I feel like a complete schmuck. I was horrified at the "gynecologist" sketch. Apparently he thinks that women who go to the gynecologist just sit there in the little rooms completely naked, all juiced up and waiting for somebody to screw. It certainly wasn't comedy, so I guess it was supposed to be soft porn. I was going to send it back and get a refund, but I'm going to destroy it so no one else will have to see it. 
      My major gripe about this film comes down to the issue of easily exploitable weaknesses on the part of the vampires. These extremely frail villains get reduced to ash with the flash of a u-v lamp, vaporized with the slightest touch of silver on their skin, and melted down in less than a second by the light of the sun. Vampires are supposed to be scary, but how frightened of them should I be if one can be taken out by throwing a clove of garlic at him. Writers for future vampire movies should work on making these creatures of the night a bit more formidable. The first Underworld movie would be a good model.                                 
 I chose this book because I have long been interested in the Salem Witch Trials. I really enjoyed the parts of the story which dealt with Kim's search for the truth of her ancestor' role in the tragedy. I'll admit that I mostly skimmed the parts which dealt with Kim & Edward's relationship---as characters, they are totally unbelievable and not very likeable.  The part I found most surprising was Kim's attitude towards medications, especially considering that she is a nurse. The drug research storyline was so, eh, I don't even have a word for it. Not worth reading. The interactions between the characters in the book are stilted and painful. I think we are supposed to feel sympathy for Kim's social awkwardness & anxiety, but really you just want to shake her and tell her to grow a backbone already. As much as I love reading, I can not  recommend this book to anyone. 
 I bought one of these for my small cat.  When I looked the collar over I found I was able to pull on one of the two adjustable portions and the collar tightened.  While that is good for adjusting size, it also would choke the cat if just this part of the collar was snagged.  I tossed it 
 It is true that the Jews have lived outside of Israel for over three- thousand years. It is also true that many Jews who live outside of Israel feel at home where they live, and have no intention or dream of living in Israel. But it is also true that the central religious vision of Israel centers on a people living in the land of Israel. For those who live by Mitzvot living in Israel is mandated by the fact that only here can one do a maximum of Mitzvot. For those who connect deeply to the Promise and Covenant which are at the heart of the Biblical vision of the world it is clear that living in Israel and helping build a special society is the commandment of God.  There are other reasons for living in Israel including the fact that it is the only place in the world where one can live in a society that follows and breathes to the rhythm of the Hebrew Calendar.  While this book speaks about the variety of Diaspora communities and their pulsing life it minimizes the fact that assimilation, and intermarriage are constantly depleting the Jewish people in the Diaspora. The Jewish community in Israel is the most rapidly growing large Jewish community in the world and it is expected that in less than two decades it will contain the majority of Jews in the world. In Israel intermarriage, and total assimilation are minimal. In fact Jews who come here from all over the world with minimal Jewish knowledge, deepen in Jewish knowledge and connection here.  It is however only fair to point out that Israel is today threatened by many forces, including those of radical Islam. There is no 'guarantee' that it is the safest place for a Jew to be. There is I believe only a guarantee that it is the place where one can take one's communal responsiblity as a Jew in the deepest and most serious way.  
 I bought this book thinking it would have helpful pointers with women, but this 'complete guide' is nothing but a bunch of fluff.  16 pages into this book i come across a sentence that should have been on the BACK of the book.  It says, this guide assumes that you have read our other two books, blah, and blah.  At the start of every chapter they shamelessly plug thier other books, "in our last book, blah, we taught you how to blah, now continuing on from that point..."  Do not buy this book, it is very misleading and has little helpful information in it 
 Not particularly interesting or funny. None of the ridiculous turns of language of a Dave Barry column, no elder-statesman crabbiness like Andy Rooney's. Just routine bitching about airlines, office supplies, and so on. Save it for "A Walk in the Woods" or "A Short History of Nearly Everything 
 This book shows the dichotomy that exists in modern-day America between the cutthroat environment that supposedly exists in the private sector, and the easy-does-it culture fostered within the public sphere of schools, government agencies, etc...  The book makes the case that America's youth are basically coddled K-12, and end up playing catch-up during and after college when working in the free-market culture of the private sector.    These conclusions have been elaborated on before in other publications, and are only true to a certain degree.  For example, the author gives examples of how Americans working in the private sector excel and achieve like citizens of no other country.  The author forgets to mention that nearly all the successful industries in this country, especially those that have gone to spawn copycats in other countries, were and are all supported and protected by government largess.  For example, automobiles would only be rich men's toys today if it were not for all those roads and parking lots built by taxpayers.  Another example, US agriculture would not have survived the Great Depression and become the world's leader in food produce if not for the introduction of farm subsidies, government-funded agricultural research, government-operated satellites and weather stations to monitor the weather, and other government programs that directly or indirectly help farmers.  These and other established, successful private industries would be nowhere without some "coddling" from US taxpayers.  Even if we dismiss the previous points, I believe the author has only shown half the picture; specifically, the author does not fully examine the question of why "coddling" occurs in schools and students are not prepared for the competition of the "real world".  The answer to this question connects the dichotomy so well illustrated by the author.  Specifically, American adults are so busy surviving in the private sector that they have less time and effort to raise their kids to be good competitors themselves.  For example, the character traits that makes for successful businesses: willingness of employees to relocate, works long hours, toeing the company line, etc..., are exactly the worse traits to follow when trying to raise kids well.   Raising kids well means living in stable communities with low turnover - this means minimal relocation of employees by businesses.   Raising kids well means spending time with them, and not spending long hours at work.   Raising kids well means teaching them to stand up for what they believe in, not what their peers (boss, coworkers, etc...) want them to do.    This then is what the author has totally missed out on in this book; an explanation of how the dichotomy between private sphere hard-nosed competetion, and public sphere cushion jobs came about.  Because of this omission, this book is merely commentary and observation, and lacks insightful thought 
 I was surprised to see that my grandmother, who has never spoken ill of anyone under any circumstance, who saw only the good in everyone she met and would give the shirt off her back when she had nothing to give, was completely villified by this book... because she is a christian. I dont think i have ever been more pushed towards christianity than by reading this book. 
 Let's face it. Rap/hip-hop basically killed itself during the turn of the century. With no talent retards like 50 Cent, Ja Rule, Nelly, Ludacris, Lil Jon, D4L, and a million others dumbing it down with processed fake lyrics and repetitive beats that drive real music fans crazy. It's horrid, I tell you. With a bunch of guest appearances by other mainstream hacks and horrible vocabulary, no wonder the society has gone corrupt. Hopefully this hack will stop rolling around in the money and get a job at the local gas station.  If you want good rap, go for N.W.A., Wu-Tang Clan, Public Enemy, and anything the members in those bands have done. For talented music in general, go for Between The Buried and Me, Unearth, Chimaira, Necrophagist, Dying Fetus, Aborted, The Black Dahlia Murder, Despised Icon, Darkest Hour, Meshuggah, Cryptopsy, basically anything that I give good reviews on. 
 Lyall Watson has made quite a living for himself by turning out books that mix sense and nonsense in an appealing way. This book, like "Supernature" before it, glibly asserts that there is indeed a scientific basis for all sorts of unsubstantiated claims made about the supernatural world.    Watson is often described as a naturist or a biologist in publicity blurbs. His PhD is actually in ethology, and was obtained under the direction of Desmond Morris, another academic given to flights of fancy in a scientific context. Like Morris, Watson has long abandoned his scientific studies, relying instead on intuition and speculation. Enjoy his books if you like, but keep in mind that you're not necessarily reading science 
 I first read this book attending a School of Evangelism, and thought it was a great book.  At the time I didn't know how to read. 
 All the .hack games are short -- very short.  So why get the strategy guide?  Because "The World", where most of the plot in the game comes from, is vast.  So vast that a strategy guide 4 time this size might be able to hold all the maps, items and everything.  So why is it missing so much?  Because it focuses on only the plot related zones and boasts that it has a "secret" zone.  The fact is the combination of servers and keywords is unfathomable!  And after the end of the game, every last one should be available.  You might as the question, why would I want to go back to level 3 zones?  Well, for completionists, that is very important because the Ryu Books of 1000 log so very much, and most importantly, how many zones you have completed (unlocked all the monster portals).    Perhaps I have just been spoiled by books like Star Ocean's strategy guide, but I find this guide to be a joke, because much more "complete" information about .hack is available online for FREE! 
 Dashiel Hammett, author of such classics as THE MALTESE FALCON and THE THIN MAN, certainly deserves credit as one of the originators of the noir genre. Unfortunately RED HARVEST doesn't live up to this reputation.  	RED HARVEST starts with the Continental Op arriving in the mining town of Personville (sometimes called Poisonville). He has been hired by the editor of the local paper, who turns up dead. This editor is also the son of mining magnate Elihu Willsson, who had called in a collection of hooligans to break a strike. What he had not foreseen was the inevitability the criminals would take over the town.   	Originally I had the idea the "red" in the title had something to do with the socialist workers movement or the Wobblies, a logical assumption since Hammett was a communist, but Hammett settles for the obvious, the red meaning murder after murder as  the Continental Op turns the criminals against each other.  	A blurb on the back of the book lauds Hammett for "sharply and economically defined" characters. They're sharply defined all right, so sharply defined that they all run together. Pete the Finn, Lew Yard, Max Thaler and Noonan, the chief of police, could be the same character. At the beginning of the novel, the Continental Op learns the history of conflict from Bill Quint, an I.W.W. organizer from Chicago, but that's pretty much the last we hear from him.   	About the only interesting character in the whole book is the femme fatale, Dinah Brand, but her sole motivation seems to be money.  	Hammett also has problems with resolution of conflict. When painted into a corner, he simply kills off another character.  	Even the Continental Op is pretty much a cipher. He doesn't seem to have much of a background, other than that he's somewhat afraid of the Old Man, who runs the Continental Detective Agency. We know he smokes and drinks too much and even takes cocaine, but other than that he doesn't live up to his cool name. Unfortunately all of this reads like a bad comic book. Even Hammett would have a good laugh at what the New York Times said about RED HARVEST, I would assume in 1929 when it was published: "RED HARVEST is more than a superb crime novel: it is a classic exploration of corruption and violence in the American grain." I'll give him two stars for noir dialogue, but the rest of it is pretty much dreck. 
 Someone should ask the author how much more successful the UN would be in it's role if the US and Israel weren't always vetoing it's resolutions to act. If the single most powerful nation on earth and it's little buddy completely ignore the UN, veto it's every attempt to act, and directly undermine it's authority in the world for 50 years, who's fault is it that the UN is unsuccessful? I firmly believe the US has a moral and ethical obligation to lead the world, and I firmly believe we can do it morally and ethically. However, writing history in such a way that the sins of the US and Israel aren't there won't make that happen. We need to know what once was in order to know what now is, and we need to know what now is in order to lead a better world 
 This book needs a lot of editing, since in it's present form it wanders aimlessly and without purpose for pages and pages before anything of substance occurs.  The book and its attempt to explore the spirit world seems like a spirit: hard to grasp and unsatisfying.  For better literature on Vietnam, try Le Le Hayslip's "When Heave and Earth Changed Places," which has its feet on the ground (despite the title) and a much greater emotional impact 
 We are HUGE Amazon customers and we have always been so pleased with our purchases.  However we were shocked when we went to use 4 out of 6  of these expensive wine glasses.  THEY FELL APART!  The glass is tissue thin!  Perhaps from shipping there are many fine fractures????  One fell apart in my guest's hand...three fell apart later that night while being rinsed out.  we handled these glasses so delicatly...I have 2 more and we would like to send them back and be reimbursed for all 6. 
 I never bought a copy of this book but was provided an unsolicited copy by the author thirty years ago. I regarded it then, as I do now, as a serious challenge against, not a part of, historical bible-based Christianity. Since spiritism and necromancy are among the pagan occult practices specifically identified and forbidden in the bible (Deuteronomy 18:10-13, Leviticus 20:6), it can be expected that a christ portrayed from such sources would also be in contradiction with the bible (fell in the garden of Eden(i.e. sinned), reincarnated numerous times, sat under eastern masters, etc.). These assertions may be intriguing to someone who is under the enticement of the occult, but to the orthodox Christian they are utter blasphemy against the Son of God. The book convinced me that Cayce functioned as a spiritist medium as defined in Deuteronomy 18 and that the Cayce readings were demonically inspired.   Nowhere in the bible does the Spirit of God endeavor to fascinate anyone with the prospect of spiritual knowledge, rather he deals with the deeper issues of the conscience; the imperative of repentance and new birth, and the seriousness of death and judgment to come. "And as it is appointed unto man once to die, but after this the judgment" - Hebrews 9:27. Denying these biblical tenets in favor of reincarnation is serious business as reincarnation glosses over personal accountability and the right of a holy God to reveal every secret and to settle all accounts at the final judgment.   Being a born-again Christian since 1967 and having advised the now-deceased author of my convictions in these matters, I would not recommend this book to anyone seeking Christ, but rather the gospel of John, then the rest of the bible. The true, living Lord Jesus is there. Repent of your sins, receive him as Lord of your life, keep his words and you will find him, for he then will flood your inner being with himself (John 14:23).    "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" - John 3:16 
 As Jason Kellner said, this collection is pointless. Only the die-hards that already have the originals can tell the difference between these and "Redux". And with a fine previous compilation like "Garage D'Or", what WOULD be the point?  Perhaps the shameless milking of a band that Virgin Records didn't see fit to promote properly to begin with? As an average Joe, would you rather see Virgin get your dime than the artist?  If you must choose, buy "Redux".      PEACE!! 
 I am not sure why this book was written, except maybe, the author wanted to add another title to his published works. This book is basically comprised of briefs from various chapters of the author's two previous books (which were very good, by the way). If you have read his two previous books and/or you are a seasoned manager, the book is repetetive and boring. The author gives many examples of real life scenarios but the stories go on and on for pages. A good book to read if you can't fall aslee 
 this book is not worth buying at all.  it seems that the author is cocky and stroking his own ego with some of his stories.  the information in this book is not useful...it's about cheating people at poker...but it is really about his stupid stories filled with inapporopriate language.  it also seems that this book could have been cut down in half if you take out all the stupid stories and repeating stories...I recommend "Gambling Scams" by Darwin Ortiz, much better and more useful 
 Ana Carolina is a good singer and Seu Jorge is a cult culture figure here in Brazil, but this CD is a mistake. Do not spend money on this 
 I'm past half way through this book and all he talks about is little stupid things like " in your face " advertisment,I'm a small biz owner and let me tell you..good customer service is essential but the growth is all about the quality of the goods or services you provide,do you go back to a restaurant that sends you a stupid card if the food wasn't all that good ? not me.. 
 now mabye this is not fair because i do not usually like realistic books but this book was boring. I hade to read this book for school and I was bored. It's about a young boy named Fu growing up and having a hard life in  China. I would not recomend this book unless really like realistic books  and ones that are slow. Did I mention the chapters were long 
 No one could ever mistake JoAnna Carl for Joanne Fluke (writer of the Hannah Swenson Cookie Jar Series)! The character development was seriously lacking, the story was choppy, there was no emotion behind the words and it was not entertaining! The Chocolate facts between the chapters were the most interesting thing about the book but not really useful, they were more of a distraction than anything else 
 I bought this headset for my daughter at Christmas.  They sounded great and she loved them, but after about 8 weeks of use she quit using them.  She showed me that the speaker part pulled out of the band. After examining them I see that it is all plastic and the wire rides in a little grove on the inner side of the band.  When the speaker part pops out the wire become the support and the whole thing just dangles around your neck. I was very disappointed with the workmanship of this product and would not recommend them 
 I bought this book for a research project I was working on for my history class, and I never found a book more tedious than this one.  Kulikoff focuses his research on economic and demographic statistics explained in very long, boring paragraphs.  In addition to that he highlights the statistics with MANY charts and graphs.  For a reader wanting to know the social history on Tobacco and Slaves in the early Chesapeake, this book is NOT for you.  If you're looking for numbers and dates and charts, look no further 
 This book has a lot going for it - coming out during the pre-internet age, suicide and infidelity - however, what bogs it down for me is the main character, Kevin Doyle.    I've gotta admit that it was nice to read about a character in his late teens that wasn't struggling over his sexuality, but rather having a problem finding an outlet for it.  The problem I have with him is his seeming apathy to everything in his life.  It seems like whether it's his attitude towards his father, his decision about higher learning or direction in life, everything can be summed up with a simple, "whatever."  Apparently the most important thing is remaining the "alpha" male.    While other characters in the book have more depth and drive, we see them through Kevin's eyes and thus there's no need to actually feel any connection with them, either.  The only other character I felt we had a real understanding for was a college student who Kevin meets while hanging out at a bar with his friends.  This book had the potential to be great, but Kevin's lack of caring carried over to my feeling towards this novel. 
 i tried, really tried to like these guys and understand why so many people say th?y are great and all, but apart from single "let?s wrestle..." the music here is extremely annoying.  You can do experimental music wisely (like Beta Band) but tweaking  buttons thinking you?re the new Can is simply boring. Zzzzzz 
 Dirty Deeds is one of those movies that you sit through saying to yourself, "this is idiotic", but instead of abandoning it midway through you find yourself still sitting through it until the credits begin to roll.  It's silly. It's a teenager movie. It's been done a million times before in Hollywood (most of the time poorly). Dirty Deeds is one of the sub-par high-schoolers-making-mischief-attempts where if you're perusing cable late one night--and can't find anything else on your 500 channels--is maybe worth a stop if you're determined to watch TV instead of just going to bed.  But who knows...you might be seeing the beginning of some great careers! Just look what 1980's teeneager movie Hollywood Knights launched for the likes of Michelle Pfeiffer, Tony Danza, Robert Wuhl and Fran Drescher. Everybody's got to start somewhere, right? 
 I really liked Tevin Campbell in Disney's "A Goofy Movie". It made the movie really special. But now when I go and see what his old CDs were like, they sound almost nothing like the guy. The music is WAY too slow paced and his voice sounds bored and well... like it's just dragging on and on. Maybe it was because the music was more upbeat and bassey--not to mention totally cool in the movie. I only gave the CD two stars because of his terrific performance in "A Goofy Movie". Check out that CD if you want to see the best of Tevin 
 I leafed through this book in a store and was impressed by the workout.  I carefully analzyed the programme and attempted to do the  routine.  Although I found the workout solid and logical, it was very rigid.  My body recovered at different stages and i found it very confusing to stay on target.  I was often faced with being too sore to do this part of the workout but not the other.  Delaying the sore parts a day would impact future workouts to the point that I could not keep the workout on track.  You would be left with too much or too little to do on a given day because you were monitoring your body's recovery.  After a couple months, I gave up on the book.  If you do not do the workout in the book, it has little reference value 
 I had never read anything by Terry Brooks, so I thought I would try listening to Armageddon's Children because I thought the premise sounded interesting. I guess the story is interesting, but I found it extremely slow and boring. The narrator has a dreary boring voice that drove me crazy. I couldn't even finish listening to the whole thing because it became torture 
 No greater writing has been offered by a great conservative thinker since the Bible.  So great is this masterpiece, that Amazon has reduced it to the low low price of $2.99 just to make sure everybody has a chance to read it!  Obviously Hugh Hewitt gets it.  That to ensure the future of America, we must hand over more control to Republicans.  Only by lining their own pockets with bribes, giving perky no-bid contracts and earmarks to their friends, shifting the tax burden from those who inherit their wealth to those who work for a living, can we insure that Hugh Hewitt will write more books! 
 I read this book because: of my love for old school jazz and the big "HOOPLA" over this publication! I can't say that I gained much knowledge from this book. If you are a true collector of jazz and know Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Lee Morgan, Charlie Parker, Dizzy, Wes Montgomery, Freddie Hubbard, Billie Holiday, Coltrane and others then you already know more or as much as what is written here.You've got 512 pages to tell a story about a subject so diverse and complex that I don't know how he did it and felt that justice was done! What I would have preferred he did was to write several books on jazz EACH concentrating on a particular era. That way I think the public would get a true and comprehensive study of our most beautiful and natural resource--jazz. Sorry but I can't offer a rating higher than 2 - 2 1/2 stars 
 Too much emotionalism, too little Bible is why I give this book only 2 stars.  The problem is that Pinnock and others have gone off the deep end in their loathing of Calvinism and have denied to God some of His basic attributes as given in the Bible.  I agree that God does change His mind, but this does not have to imply that He is not omniscient.  But as I said, this book presents a glut of emotionalism when it should be presenting a glut of Bible.  I wish Mr. Pinnock and others had done a better job of presenting a case against Calvinism, as it is not hard to do if you know your Bible 
 I got this film because I'm from Detroit where this takes place. It's a pretty typical revenge flick. Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother's killer. Usual smartass remarks, guys talking BS, fights, shootouts, blah, blah, blah. I guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch. This script was mediocre at best. Give me a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film any day over this tripe.  
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 The Kaiser Chiefs are supposed to be the next great thing from the UK. Give me a break! These guys are about as stimulating as a coma. Mundane has apparently become mainstream. I am probably older than your average reviewer, having purchased Jimi Hendrix albums when he was still alive, and gone to Replacement shows in Minneapolis when no one had heard of them but this group does nothing to deserve the praise found in these reviews. I thoroughly enjoy UK rock. I wore out copies of Quadrophenia in high school and love Bloc Party, Franz Ferdinand, and The Music as true progressions and successors to the ranks of Who fans who continue to relish British Pop and Rock. Maybe musicianship is not a criteria to go by but I produce more interesting music on my Mac than these guys can with a full studio of gear. I have never written a review before, but my disapointment in this CD has driven me to this rant! I love this UK revival of sorts and solute you all. Long LIve Rock! Kaiser Chiefs... learn to play those instruments You suck!  For those of you looking to find the excitement you found in the likes of The Jam or the Clash look elsewhere. Maybe the Rakes or Maximo Park will fill the need 
 Interesting premise...but no meat...no sense of physical place...almost all dialogue and that thin and not interesting enough to be memorable OR to fill in the story...thought I'd give it a second reading just to be fair...same/same...  Don't waste your money   
 I have been a loyal fan of Quicken for many years.  My, things have changed for the worst at the once mighty Intuit.  It pains me to report that Quicken Deluxe 2007 is a work in progress.   1. The installation CD was unreadable.  To Intuit's credit, I was given access to their download site for replacement software.  2. The reconciliation report (needed for balancing your checkbook) will not display or print for some reason.  All other reports display and print just fine.  Unfortunately, the reconciliation report is the only one I am truely interested in printing.  I am using a Brother HL-5280DW laser printer.  The printer works fine with all other programs, including the old version of Quicken.  Again, the most important report (reconciliation) will not print on Quicken Deluxe 2007.  3.  The software would not recognize the C-drive as a working drive even though the program is running on that drive (?) - go figure.  4.  The overseas Tech Support is willing to play dumb and pretend they don't know there is a problem with the software, keeping you in the chat room for hours.  I guess as long as they get paid it doesn't matter whether they help or not.  The ultimate recommendation is to reload the software - just one more time.  As a past happy user of Quicken 2004, I was forced into this upgrade. Don't expect the problems to be resolved quickly.  Intuit has been aware of most of these problems for over 6 months.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this version of quicken is just that BAD NEWS 
 This book was useless to me, and also maddening because it purported to address issues with quality of content. I should have read the other reviews here and then steered clear of this book. The content is anemic: nothing of substance here. And the publication looks like someone took it to a copy shop and made a copy of a copy.   This book simply does not offer useful information or -- by virtue of content and presentation -- 'walk the talk' of the importance of quality content. 
 If you're a fan of Salinger's work, do not read this poor written biography. The best you can do is just read his marvelous books, and forget about the writer to focus on the writing 
 I do like this new record from Camera Obscura, but not so much that I'd leap to recommend it--one might do better just buying the single "Hey Lloyd" or a track like "Let's Get Out of This Country" from iTunes.   As a devoted Lloyd Cole fan, I felt something along lines of an obligation to buy it, if only for the single "Hey Lloyd, Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken?"     Main comment I'd make here is that after a few listens, this recording grows a bit kitschy and trite--most of the tracks are set in a similar, tinny, 'faux 50s/60s' style--cute, kitschy, but ultimately limiting--record overall didn't make it too far over the hill for me. 
 Very simplistically written. Interesting topic and examples but the first part is way too elementary and self serving of the author.  Some new information but not riveting 
 Tainted Legacy is an unmemorable book with many glaring problems.  He makes absurd, unsubstantiated statements like, "Puritan society contained at its heart contradictions that were to roil American history in one form or another for 350 years."  Also, "Contrary to ill-informed right-wing opinion in the United States, the vast majority of Muslims did not applaud when the planes hit their targets on 9/11."  I'm sorry, but I know no right-winger who thinks that way.  He also refers to the "discriminatory practices against Muslims in the United States..."  but must have forgotten to back his statement up with facts.  He also gives a straw man argument of natural rights, and then concludes rights are pragmatic.  Overall, this was a badly written book that left no impression in my mind 
 In the begining of this book its was adventursum and kept you on the edge of your seat but I started to get board around the middle and had to put it down. The story line of this story was interesting and exciting in a  mysterious sort of way but really isnt worth reading. If I were you I would  skip the reading of this boo 
 I was looking forward to the arrival of this bike so much, I thought it was going to be a great way to burn calories while doing just about anything. But when I tried it I discovered 2 things. First off your legs have to be at a 90 degree angle in order to pedal without it moving all over the place (which means you have to have an adjustable office chair or put phone books on a normal one). And when I finally get settled on it no matter how hard of a setting it's on it only burns about a calorie a minute.   This bike might be great for arm workouts because it doesn't move as much on the table and it can offer a lot of resistance (though I only tried it for a few minutes) but definitely not for your legs 
 There is not enough water in the world to wash away the stench of human degradation from the individuals portrayed in this book, including the author.  Don't waste your money on this drivel 
 Unusually for me, I was suckered in by the author blurbs on the front.  This book is very difficult to read.  All the thoughts are fragmented...dialogue, internal character thoughts, action, everything.  It jumps around, never giving enough information to figure out what's really going on in a particular scene.  If the prose was better, this book would be ok.  The ideas aren't all that bad, it's just a friggin' slog to extract them from the weird prose.  Too much work.  Also, it is often unclear which character is speaking, which I suppose is another problem with the prose.  And then there's the POV...it keeps jumping from character to character.  I actually haven't finished the book...I'm on page 146...but I don't think I will, because I'm really struggling.  And I have utterly no clue where the rave reviews on the cover came from.  It's a very clunky and obscure book.  Which is a pity, because if the author cleaned up their prose, it might have been a good book 
 Don't buy it. Get a book from wrox or sun 
 I always judge music, not by the first few auditions, but whether or not I listen to it in the future.  As in the case with Tosca's latest release, Dehli9, a year after I bought it, it is gathering dust.  This does not detract from the quality production value and the sheer talents of D&H (Dorfmeister and Huber).  However, I am still listening to Tosca's masterpiece, Suzuki, on a regular basis for the past 5 years.  I expected Dehli9 to be another graceful yet complex work but after the first few listens, I was bored with the music.  Most tracks are nothing more than lounged-out versions of deep house music.  Me and Yoko Ono is particularly irritating (and don't get me started on the repetitive vocals).  This piece would be better served as an instrumental.  Wonderful, one of the strongest tracks, still has a jazzy, commercial feel to it, almost like it belongs in a shampoo commercial.  This CD is not the blunted, abstract music we have come to love from Tosca.  I thought the 2nd CD would be bonus, unreleased tracks or a "Dehli9 remixed" EP.  Alas, I was again disappointed by discovering this was a collection of Rupert Huber's experiments on the piano.  Honestly, the music was quasi-nighmarish...better suited on a Silent Hill or Resident Evil game soundtrack.  I have only played CD2 once, never to grace my player again.  In all fairness, this would be a good work to educate the uninitiated to the world of lounge, downtempo and trip-hop.  However, you would be better served by skipping this uninspired work and head to the good stuff, like Suzuki and Opera.  Hey, even the Honey EP gets better marks!  Maybe there will be a "Dehli9 in Dub" in the future?  It can't be any worse than the original...or can it? 
 The Last Samurai is a re-do of the 1990 borefest Dances With Wolves.  Once again, a formerly evil American U.S. Army officer comes to the aid of an indigenous people who are threatened by evil predatory U.S. imperialism.  At least that is what the filmmakers would like you to believe.    Actually, the Japanese samurai were an oppressor class in their own right.  The samurai preyed on the peasants.  Eventually, as reformers took hold in 19th Century Japan, a new national army based on the peasantry was formed.  When the samurai rose in revolt against the reform government and attempted to restore their traditional privileges. the national army defeated them.    The Last Samurai fails as both movie and history.  Avoid it like the plague.   
 I think I understand what Camp is.  "The Damned" is a film taking upon itself the allegorical rise and fall of Nazi Germany in such an overindulgent manner that one cringes and giggles at the same time.  I guess Gay folks everywhere can blame Luchino Visconti the "great" director for making a laughing stock out of homosexuals in Nazi SS garb.  Mel Brooks realized in his film "The Producers" that Nazi's are damn funny, but not even Brook's vision could foresee the downfall of the Essenbeck family as the currents of early Nazi bloodshed swirls about.  The uniforms are Art Deco at its worst.  The young blonde, Aryan, cross-dressers are a bathhouse dream until they're lined up against the wall.  Rome may have had Caligula, but The Reich had blonde pedophiles. What a thrill to see Helmut Berger swishing about in Marlene Dietrich bodice and stockings.  I watched the whole thing and I'm going to end this review to take a shower 
 There are not many books that I read that I find boring, but unfortunately this was one of them.  I was especially dissapointed after all the glowing reviews saying how funny this book was supposed to be. I found it very repetitive and dull. I also agree with other reviewers who wonder what the whole side-story about the tractor book was for. Those readings from the father's history book were especially boring.  It also took me more than a week to finally finish this since I just couldn't get into it. It was just silly episodes about the eccentric father and greedy, but supposedly, stunningly-beautiful Valentina over and over.  The author tried to delve a little into the history of why the sister was the way she was and about the horrors of war but then left us with no clear ideas about what she thought about these topics. We also never quite know whether Valentina is a good or bad person. Luckily I didn't pay much for this because I bought it second-hand from Ebay.  I wish I'd gotton it out of the library instead. Not worth the time it takes to read since there are much better books out there.  I learned nothing from this book and can't even say I entertained by it either.   
 Contrived, bloated, disconnected, unrealistic to the extreme. The good Wolfsschanze, the bad Wolfsschanze, the Nachrichtendienst, the Odessa, the Sonnenkinder, the Rache...good god, what does Ludlum do but think up another covert cult when he needs a new plot twist or another shoot-em-up-scene? The motivations of all these various groups are weak and thin and improbable.  Trying to keep it all straight is difficult, made more so by that fact that each is just a thin veneer for a plot twist. After a while you no longer care. For those interested in the general plot, a much better alternative would be Robert Harris's "Fatherland. 
 I would never read a book with a picture of the author on the cover 
 I can't imagine how many hours of my life I wasted worrying about ego-trippin' jocks. Although, I understand how I got hooked on this bad habit.  The rich folk who own our media do a great job of marketing this endless diversion to the masses.  So, instead of worrying about economic justice, environmental destruction, the well-being of children and so forth; the passion of a large segment of the general public is frittered away on watching one city's gladiators combat another city's gladiators. On top of that, with the us vs. them pattern of thinking that is encouraged, the anthem singing, and so many pro sports figures involved with right-wing politics (Bernie Kosar, John Elway, Steve Largent), I've come to realize how poltically-charged this so called "escape" actually is.  On top of that, I just got sick of all these sports announcers barking about this or that, wagging their finger in my face.  The ads in Sports Illustrated are also a bunch of macho [...].  By the way, before he was killed by "friendly fire," Pat Tillman was reading Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn books.  In fact, he had arranged to have a meeting with Chomsky after he returned from our war of terror.  Too bad he wasn't able to pursue that path.  My interest in sports is now limited to badminton in my backyard, and books like "What's My Name Fool?" which is about how sports figures sometimes remember issues like peace and justice 
 poor production, made in a hurry..  not recommended at least not at that price. 
 It was no doubt great when it was published three years ago but time, and the Garage Band software, have moved on.  This book has not. 
 **1/2  In "Hitch," Will Smith plays a modern-day Henry Higgins, who, for a tidy fee, will teach lessons of love to a bunch of lovelorn Eliza Doolittles - only, in this case, the Elizas are grown men who desperately need instruction on how to win the hearts and affections of the women of their dreams. Of course, the irony is that Hitch doesn't adhere to his own formula, being a confirmed bachelor with no interest in entering into a serious relationship with anyone himself. Until, that is, he meets the woman of his own dreams, Sara, a New York City gossip columnist who has no idea what it is Hitch does for a living.  It occurs to me that, when it comes to certain movie genres - action movies and romantic comedies in particular - it would be helpful if we could inflict some kind of temporary amnesia on ourselves so that we could at least think we were watching something new and fresh and not something we've already seen a hundred times before. Even the best romantic comedies can't entirely avoid paying homage to "the formula," and "Hitch" is clearly no exception. As such, the film has some mildly amusing moments, some endearingly sweet scenes, and some cute little plot complications amidst all the sentimental clichï¿½s, lowbrow slapstick and tired stereotypes we generally find in these films. (I mean, do we really need yet another romantic comedy in which one of the heroine's co-worker sidekicks is a light-in-the-loafers, preposterously effeminate gay man?). It seems like every time "Hitch" is about to win us over, it short circuits itself and loses us by going for the obvious.  Smith makes for a smooth romantic lead, but Eva Mendes doesn't always seem up to the challenge of her role, particularly when she is called upon to convey dramatic intensity. Actually, of the performers, it is Kevin James ("King of Queens"), as an overweight klutz who has hired Hitch's services to help him woo a beautiful blond heiress, who walks off with the film. Even though he's only a supporting player, it doesn't take him long to assume center stage in the film, essentially relegating the leads to second banana status.     
            Showtime certainly is no stranger to exploitation, but their latest attempt to lure in unsuspecting strangers is ridiculous! The most honest thing about this "I want my money back" attempt is how it perfectly reflects the overall bad second season of THE L WORD (I'll save my rant on Showtime's stereotypical portrayal of gay women for "Craig's List.")       I'd like to say that I WANTED to like this CD. I enjoyed last season's L WORD and both of the previous albums from the show. THIS album shows, though, that no matter how many times you tweak a tv's bad theme song, it is still bad. At least twenty of the tracks that appear here are just different versions of Betty's horrendous "The Way We Live" song which opens each episode of Showtime's sapphic show.        Since I prefer last seasons's brief but memorable (AND non-irritating) opener maybe I'm biased. Even so, the other tracks consist of nothing but extremely abbreviated score snippets. Some tracks are nothing more than moans and "tsk" sounds recorded by the EZ girl herself and the ones with promise leave you wanting way more than you should.       "Bette drunk" and "Melvin" are two emotionally pleasing tidbits (originating from episodes centering on a despondent "Bette" played by the talented Jennifer Beals) but flit by so fast you're positive you imagined them. Don't be fooled by the listing of 44 tracks (plus a "bonus"), which average less than a minute each. This is one time when "less" is NOT more.      Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer my music less sleazy and a lot more romantic; after all, when was the last time anyone enjoyed a candlelight dinner to the sounds of "Dry Hump Lover"*?    *=an actual title of one of the pieces on Second Season Session 
 We were very disappointed, upon opening the package, to see how small the glasses are.  I was concerned about this when I purchased them, but could find no info on size (and the seller is very careful to not show them near anything else that might give you a hint as to how small they are (2 inches in diameter at the largest point and only 4 1/4 inches tall; I can hide the entire glass in my closed fist) 
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 I loved Dr. Pert's previous book, The Molecules of Emotion.  I was thrilled to hear this new book was being released and couldn't wait to get a copy.  The title of this book made bold promises, but I was disappointed to find that it failed miserably to deliver.  I expected a book that would outline activities or exercises to practice the art and science of feeling good and finding one's self in the presence of God in a present-moment way.   The book offered neither, but rather, rambled on and on, outlining Ms. Pert's own life's journey in an in-your-face sales-pitch "I got it, you should too" presentation that only flaunted, and failed to ever really teach.    Ms. Pert's discussions on dietary health and wholeness were limited and contradictory at best.  If you want real data backed by science in this area, I suggest the writings of Dr. John McDougall (especially the McDougall Plan and The McDougall Program), John Robbins, and particularly T. Colin Campbell's China Study.  Little concrete information was really offered in the practice of "feeling good."  If you want practical information and a firm plan that promises results in this area, Dr. Laurel Mellin's The Pathway does more than deliver on such promises.  Recovery from trauma was mentioned, but never really addressed in a practical manner.  Dr. Peter A. Levine's Waking the Tiger and Healing Trauma give deep insights and practical attacks for freedom.    God was promised in the title, but barely even mentioned in the text of the book, most notably almost as an afterthought in the epilogue.  Practitioners of energy healing arts were given far more press than was God.  If it's God you're seeking, the works of Dan Allender (The Cry of the Soul, To Be Told), John Eldredge (The Sacred Romance, The Journey of Desire, Waking the Dead), Brennan Manning (The Ragamuffin Gospel) and the Scriptures will serve you far, far better in the desire for God.  The photograph on the back cover of this book does not appear to be that of someone who is has mastered health and happiness and is living in the presence of God, but rather, that of someone struggling in all of these areas.  I wish Dr. Pert well and no harm, but I have to say I'm completely disappointed in this book 
 What am I going to do??? I have book group in less than two hours and I HATED this book.  I can't for the life of me figure out why it was selected.  We have never read things like this boring "feminist" diatribe before.  The writing is excruciatingly amateur.  The premise is absurd.  I couldn't figure out why any news agency would report on a bunch of women walking down a rural road in Wisconsin as newsworthy.  I have many really good women friends, but the male bashing really bothered me.  Yes, there were some men in the book who were portrayed as nice, even noble, but the women-as-victim-becoming- empowered theme was quite frankly overwrought and silly.  I was struck by the lesbian overtones in the book and the amount of references to alcohol.  I am not a teetotaler, I like to drink, but the whole thing was absolutely  booze soaked - even the pregnant woman drank like a fish! I could not recommend this book to anyone. As another reviewer on this site stated - if you want to read good literature about women and mothers and friendship, please read Ann Tyler, Annie LaMott, Amy Tan, Margaret Atwood, and any number of other much better writers.  
 Profiles In Courage  By: John F. Kennedy  Intorduced by: Caroline Kennedy   Forworded by: Robert F. Kennedy  	Profiles in Courage I think is about courage in battle along with politics, and J.F.K. helps  us realize that. Profiles in courage is an autobiography written by J.F.K. he talks about some of   his what I thought were inspirations. They were senators in which J.F.K. told their stories. I   wanted to read this memoir because it seemed like an interesting political book. The important   events I thought were when J.F.K. talked about the senators who made a difference and who  didn't take no for an answer.  	I think these events were important to the author because the senators he talks about   seemed a lot like J.F.K. When the author talks about the senators he talks about quotes, policies,   and things that happened while they were in office. At the beginning of every chapter there's a   quote from the senator he'll be talking about. There's one part where J.F.K. talks about the   meaning of courage and talks about courage in battle and courage in the assembly.  	The author also talks about the bad parts of courage, for example when he's talking about   WWII he brings up the fact we lost more than 300,000 troops and 300,000,000,000 in expenses.  I think the title profiles in courage means, that when you look at courage you see all these   different profiles of people who exhibited great courage like Audie Murphy or Rosa Parks.  	    	I think J.F.K. had a lot of courage because of his brother talks about J.F.K.'s days on a   PT Boat during WWII when it's attacked by the Japanese J.F.K. goes in the line of fire to save a   severely burned comrad. J.F.K. showed courage in politics and war. When J.F.K. pretty much   stopped WWIII from happening with Russia or when he saved his boat crew member. J.F.K. had   a very good political set up. When he refused to give the order for air support in the Bay Of Pigs   operation a lot of people might have died in the army but it prevented a nuclear war.  	I don't think J.F.K. could've learned anything about himself, but that's just what I think.   He might have been inspired by some of the political actions his "idols" did. I didn't really like   this book becuase i didn't get some of the politics. I wouldn't reccomend this book to people   who don't like politics or don't like books that aren't actiony. I didnt't like this book one bit   even though it's about one of my favorite political heroes.  
 I wouldn't recommend this shuffler to anyone.  It shuffles more from one side than the other.  When through shuffling on the left side the right side is only half through.  The cards will jam in the tray stopping the rest of the cards from coming down.  The switch just works part time, you have to stop and restart several times 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 no one listen to this cos87 character.bone are some biten fake rappers that need to get outta here.oh my bad...stay outta here.3 6 has been around since the late 80s and there style is all original. bone was still playin run dmc records when the triple six mafia came out and a lot of the songs they made that this mainstream cos87 dude never even heard of that you can tell bone bit off of. i bet this dude never even heard of lil glock who was with 3 6 in their mixtape  days. stupid layzie bone sounds jus like him.but anyway...this album aint even that great anyway,i was jus angered by this dudes comment 
 This book has excellent photo's of backyard ideas.  It is a great book if you are just looking for ideas.  I had expected a book with a little "how-to" mixed in 
 I have been a die-hard Tony Iommi supporter for decades.  When Ozzy left, I supported Iommi.  When Dio left, I supported Iommi.  I followed Sabbath, and still listen to my Sabbath cd's.  But the three Iommi cd's that I have purchased, including this one, FUSED, have all disappointed me.  In this case, it's more about Glenn Hughes, whose voice I find annoying on this effort.  I would love to have seen Iommi team up with someone like David Lee Roth, or when Rob Halford was still roaming solo.  Tony needs a GREAT vocalist, and he comes out strong.  Tony is a great performer, love his riffs, but they are drowned out by the annoying Glenn Hughes on this album.  Heck, even someone like Joe Lynn Turner would have been an improvement on Glenn Hughes.  Isn't Vince Neil looking for a job these days?  Ug, so yeah, this album is ONLY for the die hard Tony Iommi and/or Glenn Hughes fan.  Otherwise, by an older Sabbath album 
 This book is not meant for self study. This book is too theoretical, and it does not give enough basic examples. It is too abstract. I do not recommend this book to anyone 
 I made the mistake of picking up this book to read over a long weekend.  The title caught my eye and the concept seemed promising, but once I actually got into the story I was very disappointed.  Too many of the major plot points are entirely unbelievable.  For instance, a child who the protagonist encounters abandoned in a village becomes a singular focus and driving element--even though the protagonist barely spends any time with her and hithertofore has not been the motherly type.  Over and over again the CIA frontman gives into her unreasonable and irrational demands, to the point that one starts to root for the bad guys.  To anyone with a high school biology class under the belt, the science is preposterous and completely unbelievable.  Much effort is put forth to develop an "antidote" (actually an antibody) to anthrax.  Cipro, anyone?  The writing is also very stilted, often awful, and at times laughable.  Too many times to count a character "smiles sardonically" or "speaks jerkily".  At times the plot turns are so poorly described it is difficult to judge just what the heck is going on.  And, ultimately, the characters behave so irrationally one does not really care.  I would only recommend reading this if you need perspective on how bad books can really be.  Otherwise, look elsewhere 
 One of the reviewers graded this product way down, based on cost of shipping.  Good warning for other buyers, but not entirely fair to the product itself.  I bought this screen protector based on other product reviews, and I'm glad I did.  The Palm T|X screen appears to be a bit fragile (at least that's how it seems to me).  The ClearTouch Crystal Screen Protector retains the sensitivity -- as far as I can tell so far -- but appears to provide a much more resistant writing/tapping surface.  From the product descriptions, I wondered if it would be tricky to install.  It's NOT.  Goes on like a charm.  Do clean the original screen carefully first, and use compressed-gas duster to get the last dust particles off.  Otherwise, a breeze to install 
 The book is well written and easy to follow, but it is relatively generic.  I believe it to be a little over priced for its content 
 I ordered Teriyaki, Original and Black pepper flavored ones.  The other two flovors are quite good but this one, teriyaki, is really sub-standard.  It has sandy texture and quality is very uneven compared to the others.  
 OK, I got suckered by reading good reviews on the net, and over hearing a trainer at the gym singing praises of Lipo6. So despite that I have never found a weight loss supplement that actually worked, I decided I'd give it a whirl.   I was amused by a previous review which says DON'T TAKE IT IF YOU'RE ALREADY A HEALTHY WEIGHT! Well...she then goes on to mention she is a VERY healthy 5'1" and 115 lbs! But she took it??? Should have been a red flag to me.   I must be the only one (don't see this side effect mentioned elsewhere), but this made me a total BEAR to live with (ok, not the B word I REALLY want to describe myself as, but it's the PG version). I was irritable, had daily headaches, and saw no movement on the scale whatsoever!   Waste of money, waste of time, waste of quiet evenings at home ruined by my annoyed mood! 
 Doesn't thiss say it all? "screw-on threads failed & my shake spilled." I threw it away and use my martini shaker instead 
 This book is not for anyone with even a basic understanding of personal finance.  There were some decent ideas (a handful or so) but laborious in reading so much basic information to get to them.  Very surprised for a book with the WSJ name on it 
 This volume is disappointingly lightweight. Notwithstanding the comment of another reviewer who allegedly spent several evenings reading it, one can easily read it in 2 hours or even much less. The pages have relatively few lines of text, and those lines are widely-spaced. Almost 30% of the book (55.5 pages out of 190, other than intro and index) is filler, comprising biographies repelete with photos of the chapter authors in their Formula 1 racecars, running in a triathlon, rubbing their dog's belly, etc., and lots of information about their hobbies, or else pages that are completely blank but for brief epigrams by the likes of Benjamin Franklin, Mark Twain and Herman Melville.  The substantive focus is almost exclusively on patents, with a dash of trade secrets thrown in. On the plus side, writers from IBM, HP and Intel have good stuff to say about licensing strategies. But the book doesn't say much about the strategic side of building a portfolio -- e.g., you won't find any mention of designing around, the doctrine of equivalents, walls, fences or flooding. Many of the articles exalt the delights of suing people. The authors voice opposing views about patent trolls, but the discussion is surprisingly black and white, with little nuance (e.g., no discussion about whether there should be different remedies for different sorts of patent owners).   A frequent refrain throughout the book is that up to 80% of many companies' value is in IP and intangible rights. But actually, good luck trying to get 80% of your market cap by selling off your IP portfolio. In the context of this book, the statistic is misleading in several respects. First, the percentage is based on the gap between the market capitalization of a company and the book value of its tangible assets.  Much of the value in this gap is in goodwill and brand, i.e. trademarks and related rights, which aren't discussed in this book at all. Second, the debate over whether market cap accurately reflects fundamental value would fill many books the length of this one. Lastly, the valuation of patents is especially context-dependent. A patent's value can only be determined by  licensing or selling it to someone else, or by using it in litigation. For most companies (trolls aside), only a small percentage of their patents will ever be litigated. It's hard to predict which ones those will be, and even harder to predict the financial outcome of the case. And the percentage that are licensed is usually well under a majority (and in many cases is zero). All these issues complicate the attribution of value to patents. But aside from some brief discussions of patent quality in one or two chapters, you won't find such issues grappled with in this book.  The three or four best articles, such as the one by M. Phelps about IBM's licensing program, are way too short and general to give you much guidance on how to implement a strategy at your company. They're like tantalizing hors d'oeuvres -- whereas the book is priced like a full meal (or a very fancy entree, at least). As for the balance, there are plenty of websites and blogs where you can get articles of comparable depth and insight for free. So buy this book used, or read it in a store. A meatier book about patents generally, including portfolio strategy, is Knight's "Patent Strategy for Researchers and Research Managers"; and about licensing programs, a pretty good choice is Parr and Sullivan's "Technology Licensing: Corporate Strategies for Maximizing Value." You may spend more on those, but they're much better value for the price. 
 It is difficult, nay, impossible, to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious, money worshipping parasites, and that is exactly what we have in this novel.    Out of the blue a godfather appears, a deus ex machina, who offers an idealistic lawyer, Clay Carter, more wealth than he can imagine or use.  Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait, a very sharp, very large hook.  With apparent ease, this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble.  Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him, he immediately loses sight of reality.  What a hollow and useless individual he is, as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world.  Whether or not there are such individuals (Enron?) is beside the point.  They may exist, but I for one am not eager to hear their life stories. The atmosphere in which they live is boring, as are their conversations, their lack of values, their hobbies, their sex lives, and their comeuppances.  Somehow, even in their fall, they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are.  Having read most of Mr. Grisham's other books, I expected better from him.  
 Suzanne Somers apparently has no use for modern medical science. Especially as a survivor of breast cancer (although of a very early stage) she is putting her life in grave danger by taking hormones. Recent studies have shown that women who were taking HRT for protection from heart problems actually had MORE problems than normal menopausal women. This is an unbelievably destructive, horribly dangerous book for people to take seriously. Being skinny is NOT more important than being alive. If you want to get the real scoop on hormones, talk to a doctor at an academic medical center (in other words, one that isn't going to mislead the public for personal financial gain) and see what she or he has to say. Chances are excellent that you'll be told to avoid them at all cost. Look at it this way: are you going to put your very life in the hands of Suzanne Somers? I'm sure she's a very nice person; it's just that she has no medical training whatsoever. *** writing from an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center** 
 I started this book because I love the quote about writing being but a different word for conversation.  Yes, there are moments of great wit.  However, they are lost within a mass of verbiage so dense that it makes your mortgage agreement look like a Little Golden Book.  It's not the sublime non-linearity of Joyce's writing or Ornette Coleman's playing.  It's the amplification of the self to an unbearable degree.  Certainly a unique achievement, I guess.  But so is Lou Reed's "Metal Machine Music.&quot 
 It's true, you can't judge a book by its cover.  I was so looking forward to reading this book, but was disappointed that it is only a dry description of the author's travels.  If you are looking for a book that is more of a "novel" about Iran, this isn't it 
 This book definately need an editor. Many of the examples,even the basic examples are riddled with errors. It is an ok read but don't expect to be a novice after reading this book 
 This is an example of one of those thousands of guitar books which discusses several subjects in a superficial way and never really nails anything down in a useful way. The author has not put forth a single original idea or even bothered to present the same old stuff in a new and different way. This book is not a guide to the fretboard, it is basic music theory for absolute beginners. If you want rock solid information about the guitar's fretboard skip this and do what everyone else does:  get Fretboard Logic. The author has released several books under the same title with pretty much the same stuff in each one. This one is a Mel Bay retread 
 Hey here's an idea. What if Hitler was right all along, only it is men, not jews, who are to blame for all the woes of the world. We should build a new Auschwitz and exterminate them all. Right Andrea? In my opinion, this is just as bad as any misogynist. It's ridiculous garbage like this that has set the women's liberation movement back for so long 
 The "original" versions are 4x3 letterboxed...  For anyone with an HDTV or widescreen regular TV, these DVDs are a major disappointment.  The original versions are matted from their original 2.35:1 aspect ration for 4x3 TVs, so they look like crud on an HDTV or other widescreen TV.  They appear to be made from the same transfers used for the laserdiscs.  The other versions, from 2004, appear to be identical to the DVDs previously released 
 I loved the "idea" of this book.  As a happy/proud SAHM, I love books about homemaking and SAHM-hood.  However, this one I have to say was very disappointing.  Basically, nearly the whole time I was reading this, the thought that kept going through my head was "PLEEEASE stop talking to me as if I were 4 years old!".  I felt that the "tone" of the book was very much like an annoying mom using "pep talk" with her preschooler.  I will give it 2 stars, simply because I really applaud any efforts to help todays SAHM.  
 This book does not reflect in any way the world of investment banking and really does resemble to an IBanker pitch book. This is especially fond in the ML director vaunting the his bank and how good they are with the new recruits. However, the Manager from DB drawn a pretty picture of the business and how it did built a department. Overall, it less than average book, Monkey business is a lot better.  Jerome 
 After a fairly good first outing with "Dark Harbor", Mr. Hosp fails with this book on every level.  The characters are cardboard cutouts, the dialog is wooden and predictable, the plot is paper thin.  In other words, everything about the book is a cliche, much like this last sentence.  Get the picture?  Others have gone into the story line, so I won't bother but suffice it to say I truly felt gyped out of the cover price of this book.  The only reason I finished it was because I kept thinking that surely it would get better.  Fooled again 
 This is pro-Albanian propaganda. Nobody knows about the Albanians' "ethnic cleansing" of the Serbs that went on for the past 30 years. Serbs were driven out of their homes by the Albanian mafia and nobody could do anything about it because the communist government allowed it to go on unpunished. Nobody even talks about the Albanians that were killed by other Albanians because they believed that an independent state of Kosovo was not in the best interest of the Albanians. UN investigators that were sent into Kosovo after the recent bombing found only 2,200 bodies in mass graves. They didn't even know how many of those bodies were Serbs and how many were anti-secession Albanians. When this report was released, the US state department lowered its figure of 100,000 Albanians dead to 10,000 Albanians dead. If you want a better perspective from a more reliable source. Watch "Children of Kosovo: 2000" it shows the perspective of the children of Kosovska Mitrovica, which has both Albanians and Serbs living in it. It's made by a famous Hungarian film-maker so you cannot think that it is directed to any one side 
 The last "5-star" review was written by the author, Jim Stewart, himself. Please readers take note that all the "5-star" reviews were written by him, aliases, and co-authors. In addition, you can see that "1-star" reviews of competitors' books were also written by this same group of individuals. I wish Amazon would verify the reader reviews so that this service would be authentic and useful. Mr. Stewart - don't you know that what you did was unethical? and don't you know that if other books on Lost do well, that it only helps your book do the same? Shame on you 
 This was one of the few books I just could not get through. Managed about 2/3 and just gave up. At least to the point where I called it quits, the plot was just goofy. 
 Not my cup a tea. Poor sound and average picture. Just for Excalibur freaks...?! 
 I am just wondering why isn't there a 0 star rating. This book is really insulting to anyone who has any business knowledge and common sense. Yes, we all know that customer service is important, and that we have to make everything possible to satisfy the customer AS LONG AS WE MAKE MONEY FROM HIM/HER. I just can't believe the ridiculous examples and the lack of any thought about the cost side of the operations. Have valet parking and own shooper assistant in a grocery store and STILL SAVE MONEY. Please, please first check the cost structure of a grocery store and see that their gross margins are rarely more than 3%. Buying from competitors and selling at what you pay for plus free wrapping? Hm, and the employee will be paid from where? Just don't want to contibue with the insulting and completely nonsense format of the book.... I rarely write reviews, but this one was so pretentious with nothing to back it up, that I just had to vent and warn - please never, ever try to read that book! 
 This book is a good one......I guess. The reason why I am not sure is that I have had this book for over a year now and I still havent managed to read it completely. Everytime I start reading it, it loses my interest after the third chapter. The authour would have been happier writing poetry about the LAB colour space. He keeps ranting on and on and on about the LAB colour space but when it comes to actually teaching you something new he does it in less than half the pages of the book. It gets to the point where the reader just goes - Ok, LAB is THE colour space to work in, now would you please stop telling me that after every other paragraph? Too much uselss information and very less practical knowledge 
 I never liked poison. The production of the actual albums are very good, but then they should be......so are Britney Spears!..and why? Well, after the new wave of British Heavy metal led to talented bands like Van Halen to get on the scene and make metal enorously popular in the US, record producers wanted to cash in on the act. So, just as Disney do today, groups were manufactured into iconic figures......in the case of poison, ....lets sell sex and string a few guitars in...oh yea, and hairspray.......and call it music! Its because of bands like poison that metal in the 80s was doomed. I hate grunge, but thank god it came before metal died forever. Poison existed because girls wanted to have sex with them....and, unlike motley crue, had no point to make musically AVOID......unless you like manufactured tripe!! 
 BOOM BOOM man this album doesnt go well.  Well i may point out first this album is completely different from the good old santana rap where did u go wrong carlos.  srry  but the only funny song is track number 4 where it goes BOOMBOOMBOOM.  It makes me laugh especially when the guy raps cause he says like a bagel cut the bagel.  HAHA but really if u want only one good song then this for you but other than that buy some good old santana like black magic woman. I LIKE THT SON 
 Have had an Olympus 4.0M.for 4 years and been very happy with it. As a gift I got this Canon and was very diappointed in the color quality and sharpness. Shot about 600 pictures people were blurred,not crisp and dim even on a sunny day. Had to return it.Don't bu 
 The crass commercialism of Pokemon is hardly the issue here. We've lived through He-Man, Thundercats, Transformers, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and The Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, with no real scar left on children's entertainment. Pokemon enslaved children in the late nineties because it was a genuinely unique and novel idea. The video game was addictive, the character designs were interesting and the marketing gimmicks of seeing NEW characters were enticing... So what's the problem with Pokemon?   Look at the industry when the previous fads hit the airwaves. Children's entertainment was all about milking toys and movies so much that each fad could survive only until the next hit movie or new toy was released. Pokemon wasn't like these previous crazes made to sell a bunch of toys until interest moves onto the next big thing. Pokemon was an institution. They created an entire world of escapism that ended up to be so powerful, not even the release of a film was able to effect its popularity. If you completed the video game, they hooked you onto the card game, and when interest on the card game waned, they released a sequel to the video game, which lead to a new set of cards... They had us working on a loop that would make George Lucas drool.   By the time the older fans grew up and caught on, it was too late. The whole industry had taken Pokemon's lead and Japan/Anime-style saturated the market. Digimon, Card Captors, Loonatics Unleashed, Winx Club, and Yu-Gi-Oh are all the obnoxious off-spring to Pokemon that have ruined the fun associated with a craze and have left the soulless commercialism. As I said, Pokemon was a cool idea that just happened to inadvertently cause one of the biggest slumps in children's entertainment that'll take years to get out of.   As for the film... It's just bad 
 The third time I used this brush it broke.  The wood split diagonally at the neck of the brush, a little  before where the bristles start.  I now have the perfect implement with which to stake a vampire.  My other Weber brush (which I purchased at a diff. website) is still intact and works okay.  You see the bristles are a little gunked up -that's why I bought this second grill brush.  -Buyers, and Vampires, beware 
   Doesn't liven up until the last two chapters.   Characters are two-dimensional 
 I bought this book wondering if it would show me any tips to improve my running technique. The book does serve as a good introduction to running technique and I would suggest the book to a person who knows nothing on the topic.  However, the book left me more convinced than ever before that one cannot improve technique from lessons in a book.  Coaches exist for a reason and this is one of them.  Runners who have great body and muscle awareness are not going to have major problems and thus are not going to need this book.  On the other hand, runners who have poor body awareness are going to need a knowledgable person (a coach) to watch them run and identify the problem. So they don't need the book either and are better of spending their money on a coaching session.  This book might be useful for a student taking a college course in coaching running but that is about it.  Beside this general complaint the book itself leaves a lot to be desired.  The photographs in the book are rather poor.  They are simply clips from a video and suffer from all the problems that causes.  It was really mind boggling to me that the publisher was so cheap as to not pay for a still camera to take photos.  The poor quality images make it difficult at times to really understand what the author is refering to in the picture.  It is most unfortunate that the authors obvious knoweledge is hindered by this  problem.  Further, there isn't a modern fad (running barefoot, neuromuscler training) that the author doesn't fall for.  It used to be "muscle memory" was all the rage.  The book would have been stronger if these issues were left out as the author comes across as pandering.     All in all I think this is a book that might serve some useful purpose for a person who knows little about proper running technique.  But for a person with difficulties it is not a substitute for a some sessions with a good coach.             
 I've been wanting to see this movie and I finally did on LOGO. I'm just happy I waited untill It came on TV. I though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it. The romance was slim to none. I thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role. Well, I won't say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it. Anyway, I would much rather watch Beautiful Thing, Get Real, All Over the Guy & The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls In love 
 The premise behind this book is that by following the techniques advocated by the "Fools," you can pick stocks on your own and do better than the market as a whole and better than most professional mutual fund managers.  Think about it.  If this premise were true, then most of the professional mutual fund managers would be out of a job, replaced by anyone that could follow the "Fools" advice.  The book is principally a big advertisement for the Motley Fool's web-site (www.fool.com) and much of the content it references isn't even there any more.  For instance, the book references real world stock portfolios called the Rule-Breaker and Rule-Maker which you can supposedly see and follow for free on their web-site.  If you search google, you'll find a page on their web-site announcing that both have been discontinued.  I'm guessing it wasn't because of their stellar performance.  Fortunately, you can still *buy* the Motley Fool Rule Breakers Newsletter for $199.00 per year.  Whew!  The book also announces the creation of a new stock index, which the book calls the "NOW 50," but which the Fools renamed "Fool 50" after the book was published.  Today, if you go www.fool.com's stock index section, you'll find no reference to the index.  You can still find links to the old pages if you search google (fool.com "fool 50"), but not if you search on fool.com.  An index that lasted no more than 3 years!  Amazing!  Perhaps the best critique of the Fools is in Investing for Dummies (Fourth Edition) on pages 382-383:  "[O]nly one of their seven portfolios has actually performed better than the market averages--two of their portfolios were shuttered after poor performance (one of which plunged 50 percent during its short six-month existence)."  Fools indeed!  By the way:  "Investing for Dummies" is a great book full of sound investment advice.  Make sure you get the latest editions (the Fourth was just released and the Third is still on many store shelves) The companion title "Personal Finance for Dummies" is also full of advice worth hundreds of times its cover price. 
 Although I found this text interesting, and mostly informative, the practice of editing seems to have slipped through the cracks.  And for this purpose, I offer my eye for future editions!  The order of content, as well as combining similar themes, could have been a bit more well thought out.  
 An album of outtakes and rarities is an odd thing.  Obviously, the songs weren't good enough to make the album they were originally intended for.  Either that or the artist felt they didn't fit right.  So how does one go about grading an album of this type?  It's not easy.  Graded as a stand-alone album on its own merits, I'd give this one a single star.  Marked by inconsistencies and a lack of flow, it's a poor effort that starts out extremely strong and ends gasping for breath.  Graded as a complementary album to "Illinois," however, I'd give it three stars.  I can understand why the songs weren't used and find several of them worth repeated listening.  If i could give half stars, this album would get 1.5 simply because of the overwhelming length.  The respective lengths of "Illinois" and "Michigan" weren't an issue as the albums both contained an overwhelming amount of good tracks.  A compilation like this of rarities and b-sides would have been better served as a 35-40 minute production rather than the 75-minute opus this package is 
 Now, before the "Castle if Mirrors", I was a big Charlie Bone fan, I could not wait for this book to come out.  All of the other books had unique interesting plots.  However by the time Nimmo got to this book, she lost her touch.  For example, this book had way to much "Harry Potter" take offs, which you could easily find if youve read both books and paid even the slightest attention.  Also so much of the information in this book was completely pointless and overloaded (unless she plans to use it for her later books.  And what was really corny was  the whole new thing about one of the characters who  has already been in the other books has just suddenly gained a power. Anways, readof you like, but I don't know if it will be worth it 
 It was revealed by GLORIA STEINEM, quite soon after the untimely death of JACCQULINE KENNEDY ONASSIS, that Ms. KENNEDY had, very quitely and unobtusively, been contributing substatial amounts of money to N.O.W. for many, many years.  Now, (!), most people would not have thought that Jackie -- glamourous, gracious, and perennially-on-the-best-dressed-lists Jackie -- would have been one to support a "right-on, with-it" and somewhat aggressive organization such as "N.O.W."....but you see, she probably was a "women's liberationist" from Day 1 of her life.  Born into the social strata that she had been, it would have been rather difficult for her to, say, join the protests of Ceasar Chauvez in the vegetable fields, or go marching with Martin Luther King.  Yet her heart -- as well as that of her husband's -- were in these places 100%!   What to do?  She found the best way, (for her), to contribute: maintain the "social" facade, increase her wealth.....and then, unobtrusively, give it to those causes in which she truly believed!   There are, indeed, far more than one way to "skin a cat"....and/or change society!  However, an extremely handsome, extremely intelligent young man of my own  acquaintance, who enjoys perfect health, had a perfect score on his SATs, who attended a top-40 private college, has a beautiful wife and precocious child, and probably a fantastic future ahead of him if he so wishes), once told me, "But no one has ever discouraged ME!"  Perhaps.  (Does he know, I wonder, that one of the women he, personally, admires LEAST, H.M. Queen Elizabeth II, once said, similarly, "But no one has ever discriminated against ME because I am a woman!")  Does he not realize, that there are SO many OTHER people in the world who are equally, (or even more) ambitious as he, who do NOT enjoy perfect health, did NOT, (due to circumstances beyond their control), graduate or even go to college, are NOT movie-star handome or beautiful, do NOT have many supportive relatives, (or perhaps none at all) -- and perhaps do not enjoy other advantages this young man hardly thinks about...perhaps not even owning a car.  Yet, they, too, may want to rise in life, and look about wildly for SOME way to advance themselves -- and perhaps, also, help others as well?  What can they do?  Robbing banks can get one into a lot of trouble....especially if one does not have a driver's licence and getaway car.  Working in a freak show, (there ARE some left), does not appeal to many proud people, (although one proud person---who DID work in a freak show, once said: "People come here and pay money to see me, I don't pay money to see them.  My job's OK with me!)  I suppose it's all how one views one's circumstances.   Hmmmm.....losing weight, having my hair done, and looking as well as I can?  Why not?  That's an almost-free road to almost anyone!  Become beautiful -- or at least as beautiful as I can!  Why not?????   I recently saw a TV report on three young women -- teen agers -- who have life-threatening illnesses. In the hospital as much -- - or more -- than they are out of it, each of the three qualified for the "Make-A-Wish" program.  And what was the wish these three young women had arrived at...each separately?  Their wish was to be a super-model for a day!  : )  : )  : )   Since each of the three had the same wish, they met, and went all together to the various places which would transform them into super-models for the day.  They also met and conversed with real models.  Is this wrong?  Body-image isn't everything,  (WHEN ONE BELIEVES THAT, IT'S A SICKNESS CALLED 'NARCISSISM'!)....but surely it has it's proper place.  Looking as good as one can helps to give a person a sense of self-respect!  And -- in  this admittedly imperfect world -- looking good CAN help one get ahead.  (If a pretty girl and a plain one both have the same qualifications for, say, a secretarial, (or any other) job....the pretty girl will probably get the job.  Why?  Because the employer will want to put on a "good face" for his business.  This is not to say that if a pretty girl does not groom herself well, that the plain one...who takes better care of herself...will probably get the job. For the same reason.  Because the employer wants to put on a "good face" for his business.  "Beauty is as beauty does", I suppose.  And no one proved this more than DIANA VREELAND herself.  Ms. Vreeland was NOT beautiful...in fact, her appearance verged on being just plain ugly....but she decided NOT to let this be a hindrance in her chosen profession.  She started and rose in it....and wound up as editor-in-chief of VOGUE Magazine for many years!!!!!!       I suppose what I'm arguing here for is the realistic discovery that yes, beauty DOES matter in today's world.  But trying to look as good as one can does N O T necessarily mean having a nose job or binding one's feet.  That is a personal decision each person has to make for one's self.  Looking as good as you can..and deriving confidence from this, is what counts.  And, (as was shown on an episode of "To Tell The Truth" several years ago), there is a young lady in India, who became a model....then used her earnings to open up her home to under-priviledged children.   Angelina Jolie has used her beauty and fame to help others as well.  The list of "beautiful people" doing good works is quite long.       And who would tell those three teen-age girls with life- threatening diseases that their "Make-A-Wish" desire to become super-models for a day is unrealistic, backward, and hedonistic? Not I.  Beauty makes people HAPPY!  And there is little enough happiness in the world as it is!       "Beauty for good".....for anyone who chooses it!......forever!!!!!! 
 After spending over an hour waiting on their help line and trying all of their non-functioning suggestions, I was still unable to install this on either of my PCs. They don't want to admit it, but their ad for Deduction Pro kills the software install at 21% (or 26% for the standard version). And no, their "font patch", killing all startup services, upgrading the Flash Player, nor starting in Safe Mode did not resolve the problem. I'm out the money on this and am switching to TurboTax. H&R Block has lost this customer. 
 Okay, I like my Mingus bluesy and rootsy. So why isn't this one of my favorite Mingus albums? To be honest, I'm not quite sure. But I only see two of these compositions as particularly revealing or brilliant: the gutbucket gospel/blues Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting (which even then is better heard on At Antibes, in my mind Mingus' finest work) and the characteristically wild E's Flat Ah's Flat Too. On the other hand, My Jelly Roll Soul and Cryin' Blues are two of the least interesting Mingus compositions of all time, with little by way of creativity, fine performances or weird melodies that I associate with Mingus. Perhaps it was just because he didn't really perfect the bluesy approach until the Oh Yeah/Ah Um period, which was still a couple years away at this point (in 1959, Mingus was still steeped in the avant-garde - this was the time of The Clown and Pithecanthropus Erectus, two far surperior albums, after all). Regardless, I see this as a mere footnote in the Mingus catalogue, rather than a dominant presence.  
 1. The subject of this book is great! 2. The writing style is a bit wobbly at times. 3. The author jumps around and discusses way too many famous literary figures who have little or nothing to do with Mary Lamb's personal triumphs and failures. 4. Very little is actually told about Mary Lamb, who is supposed to be the featured character of this story! 5. The author inserts a lot of modernistic idealogy that would have been unknown to English men and women in 1795. 6. Gives a quick summary of a very complex woman.  7. Gives an even quicker summary of a very changing, difficult, and dramatic period of English history 
 After reading Old Wounds, I was left to wonder whether a book series could get any worse.  I was almost dreading picking up the second book, Enemy of my Enemy, but since I had already bought it, there didn't seem to be much reason not to.  Whatever its problems were, Old Wounds was a quick read, so this one promised to at least be the same (despite being 30 pages longer).  I am happy to say that it is a lot better than the first book.  I am unhappy to say that the reason for this is because the first one is so bad, not because this one is that good.  Enemy of my Enemy doesn't have near the number of howlers as Old Wounds did, but that's mainly because it's using the same story and characters and thus we are used to them.  Enemy of my Enemy contains many of the same problems as Old Wounds, but they aren't as prominent, mainly because there is actually some action and intrigue in this book.  The cat and mouse game between "Chakotay" and the doctor got interesting at times, even if some of the scenes were just laughable (especially the scene where Kaz sneaks into Kim's quarters to wake him up.  What, the door buzzer doesn't work?).  While I didn't buy how long it took for everybody to figure out that something was wrong with Chakotay (as spiritual a man as Chakotay is leaving behind the body of his sister when it would be very easy to retrieve her?  That's not the Chakotay I, or most of the others, know), I was able to put that aside and let some of the individual scenes wash over me.  Granted, there weren't many of them, but there were a couple.  The problem with this plot is that it's not even remotely believable.  Not retrieving Sekaya's body is one of the main points.  Sure, it makes everybody think that something's wrong, but nobody seems to realize that Chakotay's grief in no way explains it like they seem to think it does.  It drags out the plot a lot longer than it should have (but then it'd be a pretty short book, wouldn't it?)  Golden's "romance novel" language is slightly toned down in this one, or at least I didn't notice it as much.  There is one "heaving [...]" reference which I had to laugh at, but overall it's not too bad.  The prose itself is fairly wooden, but at least I didn't feel like putting my finger down my throat.  She has an annoying turn of phrase at times.  One time, referring to Kaz and Kim, she actually says "The two Voyagers exchanged glances."  Excuse me?  Ugh.  Golden also continues to have problems keeping continuity within her own books.  In Old Wounds, Kaz's previous host's personality keeps coming to the forefront of his mind because his isoboromine levels were too low.  Then, on page 97 of this book, he claims that his problems were caused by "elevated" isoboromine levels.  Which is it?  Golden gets most of the other characters right (or at least close), but one character continues to stick out as being horribly designed.  That is Astall, the Huanni ship's counselor, who continues to be written as overly emotional and, thus, unrealistic as a counselor.  "Her huge purple eyes searched his, and tears welled in them.  She blinked them back, striving to maintain her professional demeanor despite her almost overwhelming emotions."  This is a counselor?  One of my earlier complaints was that the scenes with the holographic doctor and Seven of Nine didn't appear to have anything to do with the story.  I still believe that, but at least their few scenes in this book actually did have a little relevance.  The same can't be said for Torres' scenes.  Torres is on the Klingon monastery world of Boreth, and she begins delving into the prophecies that may involve her daughter.  This storyline is clearly intended for subsequent books and just feels shoehorned into this one, bringing what little tension there is in the main plot to a screeching halt.  The Deep Space Nine relaunch series does have a lot of continuing plotlines that carry from book to book, but at least all of the characters are interacting within those plots.  The O'Briens had gone back to Earth, and they weren't featured in any of the books until they returned to the station.  Torres is so far removed from this story that she seems completely out of place in it.  All in all, Enemy of my Enemy is a marginally better book than Old Wounds.  Some of the scenes are more interesting, the writing foibles are toned down slightly, and it didn't irritate me nearly as much.  Consider it a mild sunburn to the poison oak of Old Wounds.  I'm still not going to try any more of these Voyager relaunch books unless they get good reviews from people who are known to have hated these two.  David Ro 
 I have never not been able to sit through a rated G movie.  However, my sister and I rented this thinking it would be a funny show, and it was so terribly BORING that I was forced to leave the room.  I couldn't believe it because I love movies.  I can see how this movie would be funny for a 6 year old boy to watch, but don't count on the parents or older siblings being able to sit through it 
 The quality of this isnt great- the sound of the "waterproof" material is loud.  I dont like the side material and think it will fall apart easily.  I would save your money and buy the more expensive one that has better quality.  
 Baby Age sent me a funny pink feeding pillow with the same value of the crib set, refusing changing it to the crib set. I have to return it by Amazon A-Z Guarantee,wasting a lot of time. 
 This supposedly "new" item looked like it had been either used a few times or someone had left it out in the rain.  It arrived with the one-page instruction sheet wrapped around the plastic tool.  The silver knob that you can see on the left side of this "tool" was rusted and would not turn very easily.  I'm not sure how this tool is effective in removing stubborn watch band pins.  Maybe this tool is effective in only removing pins from cheaply manufactured watches - much like this item.  When I attempted to use it, the entire plastic body would flex and I was afraid that it would snap if I twisted the knob any further.  Not worth the sale price that it was advertised.  The most effective way of using it was to remove the knob and pin from the apparatus and gently tap the end with a hammer in order to loosen the pins.  This is definitely not worth the sale price 
 Toward the end of this novel, the lead character, Reichs' usual heroine Tempe Brennan, remarks on the "remarkable coincidence" of one of the plot points. By this point in the book, this is like pointing out to a rabid dog that it's got some spittle on its chin.  This book relies on coincidence so fundamentally that if it were removed, it would fall into 3 or 4 different books with little or nothing to do with one another.  Reichs is not a bad writer, and for someone who so clearly comes from a forensic background, is passably adept at character, plot and scene setting. She knows how to build suspense and intrigue, and never lets the technicalities of her lead character's profession -- a forensic anthropologist -- or the intricacies of her work, undermine the story.  This book centres on Brennan's investigation of a religious cult that perpetrates a set of murders. There are lots of interesting points about how cults work, ritual murder and even large group awareness programs get in on the action. And, of course, several forensic investigations where we are treated to the processes of digging up bones, collecting maggots and bugs, and examining various grim bits of the human body.  What undermines this book is that the first half is at least three different, unrelated stories; and the second is such a clumsy and outrageous merging of them into one, that one drifts from disinterest to incredulity. The jacket cover says this book is about the excavation of a 19th century nun's bones, and the mysteries therewith. In fact, this is just story number 1, which is of only tangential importance to the ultimate, main storyline.  It is not obvious, even in terms of the world of Death du Jour, why Reichs needed all this intermingling. It feels like she started writing a travel journal, then stuck a murder into each of her ports of call, then simply declared that they all belong to the same overarching plot. In this context, each individual story feels derivative, and the grand plot feels like a desperate trick.  A well-written and, at times, interesting book, which is ultimately unsatisfying and preposterous 
 This television movie, based on Stephen King's short story "Trucks" is a complete waste of time. Stick with "Maximum Overdrive", a better adaption of the story that stars Emilio Estevez. You can find Maximum Overdrive on DVD for a great price. If you really want to see this film, wait til it comes on Sci-Fi channel 
 Communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history, responsible for the extermination of 100+ million people. This book (which started it all) holds at least much of the blame. Communists were and still are a threat to the free world, and communism is a slave system. Some "intellectuals" actually support the tired mantras of Marx's philosophy, whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven't seen enough sunlight, I don't know. In any case, if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property, and is totalitarian and slave-driving (the government owns everything, including you). And the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up. Pol Pot, Mao, Stalin (of course), etc etc...who are these people kidding 
 Wood is unnecessarily hostile to Franklin, strugling to dispel the images created in the Autobiography rather than understanding their impact and relationship to history.  it is a useful book for raw information, but when it comes to analysis of that information, I put far more stock in H.W. Brands' The First American.  Brands better undertsands Franklin's gradual coming to a democratic consciousness while Wood only finds contradiction in Franklin's change of mind 
 I am a professional artist for 30 years, I am just getting to the time in my career where I want to pull the aBstracts out of my sketch Books and work them into what used to Be my representational large art ,and Be more comfortaBle. So not only am I looking for other aBsract forms and shapes, But for me, the mayBe 15-20 paintings in color( I didn't need to see his Black and White paintings in color)When I saw the colored front page, I was excited to see what Motherwell had done with color.  There must have Been 90 photo opportunites to show the command of, or his lack of command, when it came to color.  I mean could you imagine 1/10 of any aBstract -expressionist Being in color , leaving us to image 9/10 in Black and White of DeKooning, or Pollock,or Davis,or Hans Hoffman,on and on.  I will see if I can send this Back.  I feel tricked, and that I paid top dollar, for an editor ( and I don't know how they thought they could get away with it)But...to you , the Editors of this Book, STOP printing Now, and spend much , much more on color and you will douBle your sales.  If I would have seen this Book in full in a Book store , I would have memorized the short shaft of color paintings and gone on to look for one on Motherwell  that had much more color.  You see, when ABstract Expressionists are shown, they 9 out of 10 will use the Black and White paintings of Motherwell....so most of us, I would think have a need to see his work in color.....Yes, I am disappointed...Can I send this Back? 
 I selected Time to Hunt after reading the thrilling reviews I read here. Boy, was I in for a thrilling disappointment. Though I  forced myself to finish reading Time To Hunt; I found the story to be flat out dull, boring, if not moronic in the descriptions used for the characters. I found nothing interesting, nor thrilling about Time to Hunt, it was just a complete of my reading pleasure 
 Although this book has received the best reviews from students, as an educator, I hate this book. Besides the fact that the author cannot write, there is no sense of responsibility, call to action, or suggestions for improvement for others in a gang life situation.   All this author writes about is ganglife, drugs, violence, sex and glorifies all of them, no wonder my students love it 
 I have a minor sore throat and have been taking this medicine.  The medicine does not work at all.  Imagine if I had a very sore throat?  This medicine would be even more useless.  Waste of my money 
 I felt this book did not give enough information about the subjects they were to have special sections for.  It gave just enough information on each subject to get many beginers in trouble.  I bought the book for the special section on shearing.  There was one paragraph and a referance page to see a picture the was not even on that page. This book was deffinatly a disapointment 
 i personly along with my puritan brothers and sisters am disturbed by the falseness in this book. we do not live as it is printed. my ancesters did not either.  i wish we would stop being judged in this matter.  we are  tired of the jokes and it hurts our feelings 
 The other reviewers will tell you about the book.  I've read most of Preston and Child's works, including the other two books in this trilogy, and they are a good read.  What gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism.  I guess it's a necessity to get published today, but you'd think that at least SOME male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published.  I guess most people will sell their souls for money.  Just about all the men in P and L's books are either wimps, effiminate, weak, bumbling, stupid (or liars or murderers), cry-babies, scared of their own shadows, and thoroughly unlikable (even Pendergast has his moments).  The women, of course, are, without exception, tough, brilliant, shrewd, fearless, always right, on the rise to the top, always outsmarting the men, able to knock out a 7 foot, 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck (forgive the slight hyperbole), totally unfeminine, and just as unlikeable as the men.  The stories are very good; it's unfortunate Preston and Child couldn't have come up with better, more realisticly human, less insulting characters.  This slop may play in New York and California, but in Texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women.  So this is just a warning.  If you're a MAN--and those of you who are know what I mean--you'll get sick of the characters in these books.  
 There are not a lot of good books on World War One.  This is not one of them.  It is about as informative and interesting as a high school history text 
 The first time my daughter played with this book she bit a hole in the plastic which covers the snail.  The thin plastic -- akin to saran wrap -- came off with a little pulling.  I think it presents a serious choking hazard; I am returning the book. 
 Watch the mini series, skip the book.  If you are a fan of history, and I'm certain you are if you're reading this review, skip this book.  Read Rick Atkinson, or Dick Winters' account, anything, just skip this book.  The writing was high school quality, a poor job by the editors (apparently the atomic bomb was "dripped" on Hiroshima), and the story is short on the details that make reading historical accounts interesting.  Enjoy the mini series, but if you're interested in this topic, find another book 
 I've read tons of information and have researched into Jaqueline Kennedy Onassis' life and found Anderson's book to be almost fiction at times.  He starts the book in a dialogue format and continues to use dialogue throughout the BIOGRAPHY.  I found myself asking, "How does he know the exact words that Jack and Jackie said to each other when they were in private".  The book is narrated many times and it just didn't seem to be authentic.  It was a good story, however and it would be nice if the book was 100% accurate.  I just like to know that when I'm reading a biography, I'm reading Non-fiction...not FICTION 
 If you're looking for a novel with accurate historical reference, this is not it. Not only does he claim George Custer was killed in the Civil War, he places Lee's surrender at Monocacy Church, Maryland on August 31, 1863 (something I'll bet would have been welcome news to those that fought until 1865). The book is riddled with mistakes and omissions. Not what you would expect from a former Speaker of the House and a professor of history 
 my disappointment in this book can only be expressed by the following blunt statement:  the purpose of this book is to enrich the author.  no benefit to the reader is evident.  I would recommend saving your pennies and looking elsewhere 
 Bought a bandana that, if memory serves, was not clearly marked as a "costume" item. So, it's a little different than I expected, but it's not necessarily bad. Shipping, etc., werew great. 
 This book was written with the sad misconception that a name itself can completely define your character- that's ridiculous. Who says a Bertha or Percy can't be daring, exciting, or sexy? Who says a Gertrude can't be a Dominatrix? I bought this book for the sole purpose of helping with my character's surnames- I have dozens of baby books that I can turn to for first names, thank you, but this book doesn't bother with surnames save for a handful for most nationalities. Beside that, I had to laugh when I read in the first chapter that the author actually named one of her characters "Joe Q. Public". In her "suspense thrillers". I'm sorry, but I've never read such a ludicrous name in MAD Magazine, let alone a serious thriller 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 Book is out of date with modern economic thought.  Essentially restates classical economics and provides little in the way of acceptance of the need for balance between government and the markets. 
 never got the the cd. what's going on? 
 The disadvantage is you have to press on button while you style. It makes my arm and finger tired 
 If you have any respect for the blues legend, don't buy this, don't even rent it. The very few decent tribute performances do not make up for the lack of content in this DVD. Pointless interviews and speeches make for annoying filler, when all we really want is the music. Especially disappointing is the performance by Weir/Wasserman. They rattle off a an aimless and depthless "Walkin' Blues" You can't help but feel that Wasserman would rather be somewhere else. Most irritating is the claim that this so-called conference "found" a "very rare" film clip of the man himself. It is presented to a lecture-hall audience, to which Robert Johnson's son was a part. When asked by the speaker if the man playing guitar was indeed Robert Johnson, he said clearly:"No." "Ummm...are you sure?"  "YES!" "Oh...well, so it may not be him, but is certainly LOOKS like him..." Why was this even included here? If it's NOT footage of Robert Johnson, then why didn't it wind up on the cutting room floor? Bleah 
 Contrary to what the previous reviewers have to say about this book, I was extremely unsatisfied. The author makes what is so simple into something that is confusing and frustrating. Earlier chapters talk about topics that aren't even explained until later in the book. It takes a paragraph of confusing examples to explain what could be easily said in a sentence. Equations are given without proper explanation of how things were achieved. This book shows the 5th step with the assumption that the reader figures out steps 1-4. To someone new to the media planning field, I would recommend you pass this one by 
 This book is ok, but im not too keen on the way he writes - or more precisely the way he views people.  He tends to put down those who are different from him, where as other astrologers tend to focus on the difficulties you are experiancing and how to overcome them.    The interpretations are about 3 sentances long and to be honest its not really worth the money.    I brought parkers astrology which covers the same things and far more for around the same price. I recomend you look into getting this one instead - its great value and also a brilliant resourse for other basic elements of astrology. Plus - its understandable for the beginner.  You could also create a birth chart free on line at astro.com and use the parkers book to interpret it. (I sent off the free birth chart voucher that W. Hewit gives you about 6 months ago and still havent recieved it 
 In this HST compilation we are presented with a collection of over one hundred writings, all dated throughout a short period of the 1980s.  Almost all of it is rambling prose and soliloquy.  Because there was never any explanation of the context, intent, or setting in these writings, one can not easily understand it nor get any inferred meaning out of it.  He could have noted the circumstances of the places and people that he was writing about.  Instead this was just slapped together, lumped it into one, and dumped on bookshelves.  A lot of his opinions come off as if he is on a self-righteous pedestal.  He also liked to frequently note, that this or that famous person he was writing about was "a friend of mine."  In writing, once a person's name gets to a certain point he can convince a publisher to put out his work out no matter how awful onto the market, even if it is self-aggrandizing ramblings that no one can relate to nor benefit from.  So-called Gonzo journalism is mostly for those who couldn't write their way out of a paper bag.  HST lost his touch about thirty years ago.  Take him out of the oven, he's done 
 Well, the new census just came out and yet again tells us that Europe is dying, soon death rates will exceed the birth rates in places where they haven't already begun this trend. Italian women have an average of one baby and Germany's maternity wards sit empty more often than not. Native Irish are projected to be a minority in their own country no later than 2050. Racial strife and violence has already rocked England, due to out of control multiculturalism.  This disturbing trend has appeared here in America as well, with Whites consistently being outbred by foreigners, not to mention the lax border control policies our government has (or has not) implemented. The funny thing is that a lot of Whites seem completely unconcerned about the future of their children and grandchildren. Europe is undoubtedly a White person's birthright, and should be for Whites only, just as Asia and Africa is for Asians and blacks. Here in America, where this demographic suicide is also occuring, we will become a third world country within the next 50 years. Balkanization will happen and racial violence (South Africa for example) will be much more common.  Executions of Whites and interracial rapes will become more common as we plunge into minority status- they say 50% of the population by 2050, and what next? How low can we go?  Would Whites be alarmed when the census comes out with a 5% projection? Where does the annihilation of our people end?  The author of this book would no doubt be shocked by the disappearance of a beautiful butterfly, sea lions or the St. Bernard dog but could not care in the least to see White children continue to exist and thrive in a safe first world country.  -A female White Nationalist    
 I was really looking forward to this book. I'm not sure when I have been so disappointed in a story after all of the hype.  I was raised in mid-west and expected a serious story about trials of a disfunctional family. What a total waste of time. Turd fantasy is not my idea of great literature. Worst book I have read since "Running with Scissors".  I don't need to waste my time on this psychotic drivel parading as great art 
 I rank this book slightly higher than Season of the Machete, simply because I only got to page 25 of that book before giving up on it. I finished this book, but it was hardly an enjoyable read. The one positive is that the chapters are very short, so it feels like the novel moves along at a nice pace. The actual content, however, is very poor. This book is just surviving off the past Cross novels. If someone was just picking up this book having not read any of the prior Cross novels, they are just not going to understand or care about the subplots involving Cross's estranged son, his other two kids, this new love life, etc. I've read all the books leading up to this book, and I barely cared or understood what was going on.   Compare this to Kiss The Girls or Jack and Jill, and it comes up way short. The story and the plot are very thin and very disjointed. Nothing about this book keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you will only feel compelled to finish it if you are a completist. This was by far the worst of the Cross books. 
 I had high hopes for Requiem of Darkness since it had a dark atmosphere to it. Also, the characters looked very unique and intriguing. Unfortunatley, the beginning is very rough, both in content and speed of the show.   The plot is about a writer who wants to create a book of horror stories. He is always interested in cursed places and people with bad omens hanging over their head. He meets up with a gang of three people with dark powers who murder the murderers, and immediately becomes their intrusive groopy.  Unfortunately, the show is not as slick as the plot sounds. The first episode immediately starts off with the story-telling. It is centered upon a man who murdered a talented child for he was jealous. Throughout the episode, you see the man going insane with guilt and hearing strange noises. The problem is nothing interesting is revealed about any of the main characters and some of the events feel rushed and confusing without the nice introductions of who's who.   The second episode I found more enjoyable since it was unique. It is about a man with a hotel protected by the willow woman. The willow womanis infatuated with the owner and killed all of his wives and children. It even has a little plot twist, nothing extrodinary but still welcoming.  And once again, the third and fourth episodes deal with insane murders. This is when the show became boring for me. I do find crazy murders interesting to read and watch about, but I like to have more variety if this is what the who show is going to be about. Also, the show's trick of using violence and paranoia to be scary lost its buzz by the end of the DVD.  I give it an extra star since one episode is decent and the character design is great. Unfortunately, the show left me unsatisfied since the main people of the show weren't the main focus of these first few episodes. Maybe the next few volumes will be more creative and give more details on the main plot, but I personally don't care to spend anymore of my money on such a risk.  One last note: this show has very intense adult content. Don't make the assumption that the rating is over exxagerated for it definitely is not. Actually, I personally thought the rating was too low for this show 
 This review concerns the unabridged audiobook of The Last Camel Died at Noon read by Susan O'Malley. I have read that book before and I am a fan of the Amelia Peadody-series which I have read completely. The books vary in quality but they are always enjoyable. The present title is one of the most unique stories - best explained as being a satirical citation of Henry Rider Haggards SHE. I also like audiobooks and last year I first heard a Peabody-novel narrated by Barbara Rosenblat. It was quite a treat. I wasn't able to get "The last Camel.." read by her then, but was content to order this unabridged version read by Susan O'Malley. However, it was the worst audiobook I ever listened to. ...I therefore recommend that if one ever want's to listen to an Elizabeth Peters audiobook than only if Barbara Rosenblat is the narrator. Anything else would be  selfdeceit. Rosenblat even turns the weaker episodes into celebrations (all by Recordedbooks) 
 Let me start by saying that for almost any baseball fan, this book comes off as an interesting read.  But the Pinocchio Gepetto reviewer said it best--trivia, not analysis.  I'd like to add that at no point does Perry actually either (a) define what is a "great" team (not to mention a "good" team) and (b) uses some needless or unsubstantiated invective in taking pot shots at certain players' ability or even character (if you're not going to say why you think Nolan Ryan is highly overrated then don't mention it - twice!).   What I was expecting from the front cover and from flipping through the chapters (each chapter is titled after a putative role on a 'winning' team--The Slugger, The Glove Man, The Speedster, etc.) was a sober analysis of winning elements of teams that have risen above their milieu.  I even expected some controversial claims (as the cover says, "It's not what you think").  Instead, as Gepetto indicates, the book is just a collection of lists of characteristics of all 124 that have made the playoffs from 1980-2003.  So what?  They have about as much in common as the next best 124 teams that didn't make the playoffs, which is to say, not a whole lot.  He would treat the 1984 Tigers and the 2005 Padres, for example, as equally 'great.'    Finally, as a sour Yankee fan, I ask, how can a book purport to answer the question of how winning teams win when and feature an entire chapter deriding the stolen base without even MENTIONING Dave Roberts' game- and series-turning steal against the Yanks and Mariano Rivera in the 2004 ALCS?  I don't care if the stolen base only adds 3.6 runs to a team's total during the season...selectively applied, has it been or could it be a strategically useful device for a winning team?  Perry never even approaches that kind of analysis.  Good read, but not worthy of the sabermetrics pantheon 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 I remember when this recording came out and Wynton Marsalis was being hailed as the second coming of jazz. I picked it up right away. I was mystified by the souless mimicry of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers and Miles' 2nd great quintet--this punk was supposed to be the savior of jazz? Listen as Wynton negotiates technically difficult arrangements, stopping on a dime! Marvel at his ability to explore the full range of dynamics within two bars!! Gape in wonder at the fussy arrangement of Think of One that strips the tune of any semblence of swing!!! I get it, Wynton--you've mastered the trumpet, technically speaking, which is no mean feat. And you can read music. Bully for you. The only trouble is that you have nothing meaningful to say. Ordinarily, I'd feel sorry for you, having wasted all those hours of practice, except that you trashtalk musicians whose dirty drawers you aren't worthy of washing. People like John Coltrane, Joe Zawinul, Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock...I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. This music is jazz by and for people who think that the best way to honor the past is to preserve it like a roach in amber, thus killing it. 
 I have been trying to help a friend critique her mystery novel and get it ready to publish and thought that a published author would be able to help. Unfortunately, this is not the right book for it. I passed up other lesser known 'How-To' authors in favor of this one, and I regret it. You know you are in trouble when the first page is a FOREWARD (instead of a FOREWORD) and the guy who writes it spends all but the last sentence of it talking about himself instead of about Hayden's book.   The first 80 or so pages are not bad. They are very general, but there is some good advice there. Then from there on, the author spends the next 40 pages giving trite and yawn-worthy grammar and usage advice. The final 30 pages before all the author interviews are general commentary about contracts, mystery groups, and writing a series, but again, it is all so general as not to be very helpful at all.  From page 152 on through the interviews, we are treated to some interesting stuff from various midlist to famous authors, but none of it helps reach the goal of the title, Writing the Mystery: A Start to Finish Guide for Both Novice and Professional.   Lastly the FAQ and Index are both rather weak. This book is not detailed enough to help a novice, and it is so general that a professional would only sit there saying, "yes, I knew that, yes, I knew that, duh, nothing new there, etc." The writer is cogent, and her delivery sound, but this sure doesn't help anyone much if it is not always really on-topic in a way to help write a novel. A good editor could have cut half the blather and inserted another 100 pages of helpful details and advice. The book just does not go anywhere, and I am sorry I bought it instead of one of the other mystery crafting novels. Back to the drawing board 
 I was sorely disapointed with this book and I'd return it if I could. Even though John Edward denies this book isn't solely for Catholics... WRONG! It's everything he denies it is, and if you are a non-Catholic or even non-Christian, you will definitely not appreciate this book. Filled with stereotypical Catholic drama with a dash of New Age. Not at all what I expected. I really enjoyed Edward's other books. A New Age tribute to the Catholic Goddess. Too bad for his many fans who aren't Catholic or Christian 
 Dear Oh Dear... Another paganistic and beastly concoction disguised as spiritual awakening. Obviously influenced by the likes of A A Bailey, H P Blavatsky, Aleister Crowley and other Beastly doers of deception. Notice the 666 slightly camouflaged but still blatantly obvious on the front cover? I urge you to read this but to be analytical and on your guard as many of the buzzwords and phrases have alternative meanings. Good people DO NOT be fooled by this ungodly attempt at corrupting the hearts and minds of vulnerable people. May the true God (not some spirit of the earth or a LSD-trip) bless you all 
 This is the first time I have ever reviewed a product and I do it so that no one else will waste their money on this.  It adds virtually nothing to XP.  Too bad they didn't make it as interesting as their packaged media edition.  That would have been worth the money, but old Bill who doesn't want to be the richest man in the world would rather you spend money on a new PC to get that product.  The themes are nice but far too few for the price.  The games are a gimmick since you have to pay to play the real things.  The DJ is dumb and the dancers are cute but after a while boring.  Hard to figure out how to use the music converter and photo stuff.  Too bad could have been something but in its present form, not worth the money 
 There are definitely better useless info books out there.  This books is totally useless and boring - did not find anything of real interest.  I advise purchasing ONLY if you see it at the 99 Cent Store.  My 12 bucks was definitely too much for such rubbish 
 I am a teacher in Colorado. Being interested in new ways to stimulate my students and inspire them to learn, I picked up this book. Although its message sounds good, it is in fact impractical and impossible to apply to the classroom without losing control of the students. It is obvious that the author made up many, if not all of these stories about his successes, because he is obviously a failed teacher. I pity all of the students he has taught 
 At one time, Southern Living was truly a source in our family for cooking ideas.  Over the past few years, it has become a collection of new things to do with canned and boxed food, in a sad attempt to re-arrange the same old thing for people who do not know how to cook.  Only the Christmas book seems to actually embrace cooking now.  We cannot speak to its information on gardening, just the cooking part.  If it were not my mother's habit of reading Southern Living, we would have cancelled this long ago.  If you are a serious cook, get the cookbooks from years ago.  The current magazine is well beneath you 
 Dreyfus' understanding of distance learning is quite limited. On page 39 of this book he defines distance learning as "the correspondence-course model of anonymous information consumers." Distance learning has a lot more going for it than that, I have found that there is a lot of interactivity in online courses and a high level of communication with the professors. I took one of Dreyfus' classes at Berkeley as an undergraduate and I never got to talk to him, there was no face to face learning. If you feel that the lecture method is the only way to learn, then the internet is not for you. If you want to feel like a "disembodied presence" go take a class at Berkeley as an undergrad 
 Ok, this was a kind of nice little book. But not really. The information inside of this book was VERY basic. It never went into details about betta housing (just kept on referring to betta bowls, tiny little bowls in which a betta WOULD NOT be happy in). So thats what took away some starts, was the lack of useful information.  This book had a lot of pictures. Pictures are all well and good, but not in this book. Most of the pictures were of older, boring 'veil tail' finned bettas. Those are bettas of the past. Now we have half moons, and crowntails, so much better. But there was one image of a half moon, and one or two of delta tailed bettas. So the betta community was not represented in the least by this book. Just old veil tails.   Overall, not a good book. 
 This book was recommended by our baby's pediatrician. Its really a "cry it out" book. So it depends on if that's a method you're willing to inflict on your child. We're looking for a new pediatrician 
 I bought this speaker about one year ago from Best Buy, very disappointed.  The sound quality is terrible, I have two presence channel $15 KLH speakers that sound better than this.  No high end speakers have cabinets made of plastic, hence why Bose is not  high end.  After a year of misery on my ears, I've replaced this with a Paradigm center speaker that only cost $20 more, and the difference is not even comparable.  Do not buy this, or any Bose product at all.  Save your money and buy Paradigm, B&W, or similar, most of the time they cost a little bit more, but sometimes actually less and are actually high end speakers, and you will get your money's worth 
 You can use this case for storage which is what I do now. It doesn't allow me to click the buttons, the bottom two since it squeezes it already and it's down so I can't access them. Overall, it's ok for just keeping your player in there. I really recommend an invisible shield, it works better than this case for sure. This case is a bit bulky, but it's alright if you don't mind taking the player out to press the buttons to change songs and put it back in. Sometimes when you put it back in, it will accidentally press one of the buttons which can be annoying and pretty much is. Basically, if you want a case to keep it in this isn't too bad, but another product is better for sure. Either my case was jinxed or they are all like that. 
 Having so much enjoyed the first two volumnes in this series, I was not prepared for this turgid list of self improvement. Yes Clive is well read, English and Italian, yes he does know the difference between a Donatello and a Michelangelo, but do we need to know every book he read in the two years, every painting he saw and how it moved him. The simple answer is no. Unfortunately it takes 250 pages to find out. The story of how a drunken extemely funny youth becomes a sober mildly funny old pseud 
 Joseph Goebbels seems somehow to be writing books from hell! Never have I read such an eloquent exposition of the sufferings of those poor, poor Naz...oh- I mean Germans at the hands of those mean, mean commies. After their benevolent invasion and occupation of the USSR the Germans definitely deserved better! That poor misundertood pacifist Hitler was outfoxed by that mean ol' Uncle Joe! Barbarossa was just a "pre-emptive" perfectly reasonable police action! Communism IS worse than Nazism! I get it! Sieg Hei...oh- I mean Deutschland uber alles 
 I have been a Dean Koontz fan for years. When he is at his best, heis books are VERY good. I used to think that even when he's formulaic, at least his books are always entertaining. Recently, I've had to reevaluate him. He can write books that are bad. I was disappointed by "The Taking", and now this... I've been listening to this as an audiobook, but now I'm turning it off. I usually don't write reviews on books or films I don't finish, but this one, I had to give up and feel abliged to warn others.   I made it almost halfway through the book, waiting for something to happen. I really don't care to know how the story ends because it's hardly started yet. There are several parallel plots, all overwritten, with long portions of text where nothing happens and too many characters that feel not realistic, but constructed to be likeable and/or funny. I've always liked the way Koontz writes characters you really get to know and care about, but this time it's way too overdone. They can't just sit around feeling sorry for themselves and have endless dialogues that doesn't move the plot forward. Something must happen for a book to be interesting.  I was a big fan but I'm going to be very cautious about his books in the future. I'm not going to waste more time on this one. Not recommended even (or perhaps especially) for Koontz fans. 
 I agree that this is technically an excellent film.  But it is also unrelentingly grim and without a payoff of any kind.  Given the lowlifes who inhabit this story its hard not to sympathize a bit with Richard Widmark's character.  His enthusiasm is as boundless as his optimism.  But in the end he doesn't just lose; he is literally thrown away as garbage.    And then there is the wrestling scene which was so gruesome it was hard to take.  All in all, I was left with the question, what is the point?  The commentary leaves a lot to be desired as well.  Its basicly a description of what you're watching, while you're watching it.  I see everyone regards this as a masterpiece so I'll watch it again but as film noir goes there is something very unsatisfying about this movie.  
 As a fan of Acorn Media and a viewer of anything BBC that I can get my hands on, I have to say that I was disappointed by this production. Lovelace was far too villainous (every villain needs a redeeming quality). And the presentation of the "fake fire" followed by his complete recklessness seemed straight off the set of a high-school play.  I regret being this harsh, as I'm always rooting these programs to be first rate. But the performance turned up no redeeming characters for me -- save for Hermione Norris (whom I have worshipped ever since seeing Berkeley Square). Saskia Wickham's performance as Clarissa is without nuance, never truly tempted and predictably snappish throughout.   I walked away from the screen wishing Andrew Davies had writ the script 
 It crushes the cereal into practically nothing and it is so hard to turn I can barely do it, never mind letting my kids try to do it. What a waste of money 
 This album finds Billy Joel at the dawn of the superstardom to come.  There are a number of songs that could very well have been hits had this album been released after he had been internationally established with The Stranger and 42nd St.  Notably - Miami 2017, Summer Highland Falls, and New York State of Mind are album-cut classics and are as good as anything he had written before or since.  For those fans who were introduced to Billy Joel through Just The Way You Are, and the rest of The Stranger album, Turnstiles is well worth the purchase to discover a prior album of equal weight and substance 
 I will never ever recommend this author. She may claim to be a Christian, but her behavior is anything but. This person has no business counseling parents of homosexuals, as it is clear she has no understanding of them. She describes them as something that formed wrong, flowers that didn't open. I have news for you, Ms. Johnson. God doesn't make mistakes. Each person is made that way for a reason, just because you can't get out of a stone age interpretation of the Bible, don't infect other parents and friends of gay people with your poisonous fake christian "love". I want to go wash my hands in lysol. It is because of attitudes like hers that Christians like me are portrayed as a bunch of whacko nutjobs 
  After the excitement of THE WOLVES OF CALLA, SONG OF SUSANNAH is more than a little disappointing. Susannah and her demon possessor, Mia, are off to give birth to whatever, Roland, Eddie, Jake and Callahan are in hot, well, lukewarm pursuit, and for many pages nothing happens. Many, Many pages. This book plays to the worst parts of the series, overly mannered speeches, cryptic messages, 19's all over the place and page upon page of meaningless dialogue that will interest only fans of minutia. There are a few moments where things pickup, like when King himself makes an appearance, and while it proves  interesting for King to take such a hard look at his 70's self, it's not exactly Kilgore Trout meeting Vonnegut in BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS. Another problem I had was that unlike the clear and horrifying creations of Wrightson and Whalen, Anderson's blurry impresionistic images left me cold and did nothing to enhance this volume of THE DARK TOWER. For the second to last book in the series I had hoped for some real resolutions to some of the problems, but I guess King decided to save everything for the last book.   P.S. Man, if I heard that baby called "the chap" one more time... 
 Delores Cannon certainly gives us an interesting view into the lives of the Essenes.  Built on the assumption of reincarnation and the possibility of past life regression, she attempts to show much detail of the times and peoples that were the Essene community, and ultimately, the life of Christ.  While it certainly is interesting reading, it is completely devoid of corroborating evidence.  She tends to agree or disagree with Archaeologists (never saying who her sources are), depending on whether they agree with her research.  Also, she supports the validity of her story as being more authentic than the Biblical account, as she claims to have an older source, a teacher named Suddi from the Essene community.  Some problems include the fact that while she claims the Biblical record has been changed, she seems to forget that the Dead Sea Scrolls from Qumran actually show the accuracy of the Biblical record, by moving the Old Testament back 1100 years, and yet with no significant changes.  It seems that her purpose is to promote her own view of reality, than to deal with any real historical evidence.  While it's an interesting story, I have to deeply question that there's anything resembling true research or evidence in this book 
 I'am unable to get this message to anyone.  This is the second book I orderd and both books are bad.  This one starting on disc #4 all is bad. I sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure but no one has contacted me.  I had the same problem on Vanishing Point, the cd left will not play on my player.  I will not order another book from You. Once I can see this happen, but twice is unacceptable 
 this movie is such a rip-off of every sci-fi/horror movies that have come before it that i just couldn't enjoy it! a waste of my time and money and i'll not waste any more time on this stinker or it's review!! 
 Although the eighth edition will provide valuable understanding of the methods and means by which trees are valuated there is currently a 9th  edition in print with the current information used in tree valuation 
 This is overall a real hoot! Anthony Hopkins is superb! "Fats" the dummy steals lots of the scenes.  The question that crosses my mind is which is more frightening the Dummy or Ann Margarett trying to act!  Burgess Meredith is great as the manager. One point of interest is the horrible score by Jerry Goldsmith.  He throws in a great harmonica riff when we see "Fats", but during some of the more "romantic " scenes the music is so cloying it would make Yanni blush.  Don,t miss the extras where they talk with the real "vent" that worked with them on the movie.   If you like movies that are a bit "outside" this is a must have for any collection.  Pete Cavan 
 The subject of the Dead Sea Scrolls is a fascinating one.  But the book was very dry and tedious to read 
 You don't want to read a book about writing that is badly written.  As far as I can tell, Usborne figured that since the book is offline, it should not follow the high-impact rules of writing that he would use online.  Well, online and offline writing is not THAT different!  This book is turgid and useless.  Other books on the market are superior 
 Quality is fine but the 6-inch size is too small to be usefull 
 I watched this movie, not because I am into Ms. Milano, or her breasts, but because it was shot (sadly) at my high school--Shattuck-St. Mary's School in Faribault, MN. Doesn't say much for the school, or for the faculty who had bit parts in it. 
 So there i was surfing the net... listening to suicide kings in the background.... thinking... okay so i just won the Young Indian Jones trading card set... what ELSE should i get that has sean patrick flannery in it! A HA!  here we go... a movie with BRITNEY MURPHY as well- SCORE! Well... i was sadly sadly... very disturbed that i paid this much money for a movie that sucked this badly.... if you like quirky black comedies... this movie is for you... but not for me! Sean patrick flannery drives around with his wifes skeleton... britney murphy causes her fiance to kill himself because she doesn't want to marry him.... it all just sucked...  sean though... is still of course sexy sexy! and so is brtney murphy- but i think she looks better as a thin blond.. than a baby fat brunette... 
 The book grabs the reader with an interesting title then immediately starts off with a look at a boring movie and then reviews of even more boring competing therories. Finally the authors reveal the information ecology therory. Unfortuanately, the don't offer much to back up their view and paint a picture of it being another feel good PC therory. Too bad since they have a valid point that will sadly be lost as another PC mistake.. 
 Now that Professor Chasteen's personal friends, ex-students, and professional connections have had their say, perhaps a dash of insight would be relevant. This is a lousy book, in part because the premise is ludicrous. There cannot be a concise history of Latin America for the same reason that there cannot be a concise rendering of Newton's Principia. Thus, what professor Chasteen has provided is a concise overview of his personal prejudices, the vast majority of which he directs against (and here's a surprise) the United States and Europe. That these prejudices are personal is evident from the dedication (in which he states that his Latin American children are improving the US simply by their presence) until the meandering, pointless fizzling out of his discussion 250 pages later. The history is mediocre, at best, and some of Chasteen's opinions are so ridiculous (anyone historian who singles out the Carter administration's foreign policies for admiration has been hitting the bong a little too hard) that you have to wonder why he continues to live in a country he so plainly abhors.  The writing is so saturated with neoliberal condescension that professor Chasteen's acknowledgement to the over 100 students who read the manuscript seems a wholly fitting exercise, given that they may well have written the dreadful thing 
 I have this book and it is weak as hell.  It doesn't give you anything common sense can't figure out for you.  It doesn't explain anything in great detail enough to help you out at all.  Don't waste your money.  Try trial & error.  - Shabam the moderately sober fat mac 
 This book is a tormented stream of consciousness from a lady who was obviously fighting major demons.  It is exactly the type of book that you would expect an amateur academic to "wow" and "gush" over, as it nicely fits into the dogmatic radicalism of Chicano Studies.  The discerning reader, on the other hand, sees page after page of outdated cliches, sob-stories, and anger-filled tantrums.  Anzaldua would like you to believe her suffering and self-searching  is all the fault of the "white" culture encroaching upon the enlightened cosmic race of the mestiza.  She'd like you to think that her mestiza/chicana/lesbian/female identity is the sole cause of her misfortune and hardship.   What becomes overwhelmingly evident upon reading her unabashed torrent of decadent self-pity is the learned and self-enforced quality of her "opression".   Anzaldua helplessly wallows in her romantic fatalism dreaming of the great mestiza revolution that will fix all of the world's problems by turning the middle class value system upside down.  If you like romantic literature, and enjoy the hopeless and sorrowful ramblings of society's self-marginalized, I might suggest "The Sorrows of the Young Werther" by Goethe or some poems by Lord Byron - at least then you get some literary value 
 Term Limits is so bad, it should become a pop culture icon ala Rocky Horror Picture Show; fans should be made to wear strange clothing and recite the worst passages to music at midnight. It's so bad that by the end, the act of reading has become blatant rubber-necking - ooh, wow, did you see that?  Ugh!   The writing is amateurish at best.  The author's favorite action verb is 'grab' and he uses it repeatedly in scenes ranging from the mundane (the grabbing of keys and doorknobs) to the romantic (the grabbing of hands and other body parts).  Similes and metaphors are conspicuously absent, but there are plenty of adverbs and adverbial phrases to fill the gap.   The author switches back and forth between referring to his characters by their first and their last names; sometimes he uses one and then - in the very next sentence! - the other. "Michael grabbed her by the shoulders and turned her around. O'Rourke saw the tears in her eyes and tried to put his arms around her..."  He makes many grammatical errors, the most irritating of which is the substitution of 'that' for 'who' consistently ["Congressman O'Rourke received this tape earlier today along with a letter from the assassins that were responsible for killing..."]  The dialogue is stilted and clunky - at the lowest point, he has his assassin ask another character to tell him what has 'transpired' since last they talked.  Rather than simply 'saying' things, the characters yell, shout and scream them, resulting in the unfortunate image of the president of the United States waxing shrill and screechy at his chief of staff.  The plot is neither plausible nor compelling.  The protaganists include a bunch of renegade CIA operatives who murder 'bad' politicians, and a Congressman who approves of these actions and even helps to kidnap and murder a 'bad' retired CIA black ops director.  The antagonists include the aforementioned black ops director, the head of the national security agency, and the bumbling and ridiculous White House chief of staff.  The demand made by the 'good' assassins, following their murder of four prominent politicians, is that the president present a BALANCED BUDGET with NO NEW TAXES to the Congress!  Our intrepid hero-Congressman finds this a worthy cause, and when some 'good' politicans (i.e. the sort who push for the balanced budget idea) are murdered, he is inspired to wreak some violence of his own.  No one, whether they be protagonist or antagonist, seems to possess a moral compass.  'Bad' guys can be murdered indiscriminately and no consequences will be applied; the murder of a 'good' guy may be avenged, again, without consequence. The climax and its aftermath are laughably bad; of course, I can't reveal the ending, but let me just point out that the climax begins with a bunch of CIA operatives sneaking into a house by jumping out of a helicopter hovering overhead.  Apparently, this is some kind of silent helicopter, because the people inside the house were unaware of its presence.  That this book was published at all, much less that it received initial printings large enough to place it on the bestseller list, is emblematic of everything that has gone wrong with publishing.  It stands as a slap in the face to every talented writer in the country. 
 do not buy this system.  for the money there are much better systems out there.    I bought this for my family room mainy for the small size of the cube speakers.  The main problem with the system (which bose has corrected by the way) is that the "acoustimass" component (bose's fancy name for a subwoofer) is not active (or powered) which means the base is totally inadequate and is overun by the cubes which have no mid or bass ranges.  The result is that you get a very "tinny" sound out of most applications including dvd's.  I ended up getting a sony active subwoofer and it sounds much better.    In hindsight I would have bought a different brand than bose, but already had to much invested in bose to scrap the system completely, and the size of the cubes is nice.  Still pissed that I spent that much money on a substandard system, but hey, got sucked into the bose marketing machine 
 If you are interested in learning about Painless Wiring (the company) and the products they offer, this book is for you. I was searching for a book that could explain to me how to wire a car from scratch as well as trouble shoot an exisiting wiring harness.  The book did a little of both, but everything referenced in the book was about the companies products.  Nothing against the company, it just wasn't what I was looking for in a book.  I've found that there are 2 other books out there that really do help in both departments.   "Automotive Electrical Handbook" althought written in 1986, is a great learning tool for wiring a car from scratch.  Haynes "Automotive Electircal Manual", will teach you to how to fix an exisitng wiring harness.  Both of these books combined should make anyone interested in understanding how electricity works in your car feel more comfortable either working on your car or understanding what mechanics are telling you is wrong.  I'm rewiring/fixing a 1957 Chevy's wiring, and trying to fix a 1991 Jeep Wrangler.    
 Ice T is a air force pilot turned evil doer for hire in this action "thriller".  Apparently on US Air Bases, they don't lock anything and easily allow their stealth jets to be taken.  Also, the guards that are supposedly looking out for people trying to break in to the base are completely surprised, when the exact thing they are supposed to be doing happens, and allow themselves to be shot.  And where exactly did a man that feined his own death get at least 5 bank accounts all in different countries?  Wouldn't it suffice just to have one Swiss bank account?  Apparently not for Ice T.  Of course in the conclusion he is ultimately spoiled by a wristwatch with no band, that can apparently counteract all the stealth features of his jet.  I would recommend this movie, but it is terrible.. 
 The idea was good but Natasha simply didn't have the talent to put it in written and understandable text. She switches all the time the "I", got me confused about who she was talking about, her or her aunt.She mixed both stories, suddenly she wants to explains her "great destiny" (narcissism) at the same time as she tells the strory about her great aunt. Those second, third, fourth, xth brother's wife, sister, uncles, all irritating narrative. I really tried to like the story, to pick and read and just gave me headaches trying to figure it out whose story she is talking. Go back to school. I don't know how the editor accepts this kind of book to be published, need a lot of editing. Maybe someone in the publishing house is her relative. 
 Do not buy this book.. The information was very repetetive and worthless. The main advice in this book was to get a group of manufacturing, marketing, and patenting "experts" that would guide you through the whole process of product development ..!! The whole book keeps referring to these "experts" numerous times in almost all the chapters. I also didn't like the side quotes found on each page. They were distracting and offered no real useful information 
 In her excruciating effort to outlaw the slightest discrimination, Nussbaum neglects the worst discrimination of all: that based on age.  The child in the womb, the disabled infant, the elderly patient threatened by  Kevorkian find no safe harbor here.  And in her pleas for tolerance, the  intolerance toward the religious person, especially the Roman Catholic and  the Muslim, finds no censure.  For all the metaphysical wallpaper, this is  nothing but a tract for the politically correct dowager in Westchester 
 I found the book mostly entertaining until the end. I was very disappointed by the convoluted story, and things were not explained very well at the end. I loved all her other books, but this one was horrible. I found it much more violent and disturbing than previous books, too. The stupid DID ending came out of nowhere and made no sense (maybe she has been watching too much One Life to Live). There were too many characters, too many plot threads, too many murders, and it was not tied together very well.  I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  I sure hope her next one is better 
 After I have read more about the French Revolution I will try to read the  book again. I have read The Comming of the French Revolution by George  Lefebvre and enjoyed it 
 At first it smells very sharp and citrusy, almost like men's cologne. Then few seconds later it mellows out a bit and smells somewhat herbal. After 15 minutes you won't be able to smell it at all. Very hyped up mediocre perfume with very steep price tag. You'd be better off buying a bottle of Herbal Essence shower gel and getting identical results 
 The essence of "Iraq Confidential" is that the CIA and NSC were unwilling to permit a U.N. arm led by an American to successfully investigate what weapons Saddam had.  The problem was that U.N. policy was to lift sanctions once Saddam had shown disarmament, while U.S. policy was to retain sactions until regime change, regardless of Iraq's armament.  In addition, there were also problems with poor coordination between the CIA and FBI.  The key "bottom line" is that this Machiavellian U.S. strategy to defeat arms inspection probably led to the U.S. and G.B. being convinced in 2003 that Saddam had WMD when he actually had none, and thereby an unnecessary war.  As for Scott Ritter, he ended up becoming controversial himself (to say the least); fortunately Seymour Hersch's vouching for Scott makes the book credible.  Regardless, "Iraq Confidential" should have only been an article - not nearly 300 pages 
 Mr. Halberstam continues his decline as a serious journalist. This odious valentine to the 50's Red Sox should come complete with a hanky. Ted Williams & co. deserve better 
 The Maverick guide to Bermuda didn't meet the high expectations set by other reviews here. There isn't a whole lot to the book, it isn't full of secret suggestions as others suggested.  Instead there is much on the obvious basics and little beyond. Our family did enjoy the chapter discussing some of the colorful history of Bermuda, but otherwise I regret the purchase.  I suspect one of the other guidebooks would have been a better choice. I do recommend Bermuda 
 The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy is an interesting but somewhat confusing look on the early west of America. The story begins with a father and two brothers trying to track and trap a wolf that had crossed over from Mexico. The Wolf is a mother and is supposedly carrying around pups with her. This part was particularly well written, but became confusing when Spanish was being used heavily. In review of this part I believe that there was something deeper in the crossing of the wolf and thought of it as a metaphor to immigration issues. The short-lived story of the capture of the wolf was ended by a cleverly placed trap by one of the sons. 	Instead of killing the wolf as some would have expected (though that would have ended the book rather abruptly) the two sons decided to return the wolf to Mexico. After this happening the brothers go on various adventures including running away with a heartthrob, attempting but failing to join the U.S. army and crossing in and out of Mexico a total of 3 times.  	This was a well written book but there were many useless characters in it that just seemed to distract you from the actual point. The over use of the Spanish language confused me and would confuse anyone who doesn't speak it. I thought this book lacked motivation and suspense, but because of the author's brilliant mastery of the English language he was able to entangle me enough to finish it all the way through 
 I've been taking an intensive German translation course this summer and because I haven't taken any German before this, I didn't have any vocabulary coming into it.  I bought this book as a supplement because I wanted to have as many resources as possible to get through class.  My problem with it has been that most of the verbs I've tried to look up haven't been in it.  I've only found a few of the verbs I've tried to look up.  Part of this, however, has to do with the compound nature of German, and another part has to do with the fact that 501 really isn't that many verbs in the grand scheme of linguistics.  If you're learning German for fun or to travel, this book would probably be pretty helpful, but if you're learning the language for academics or for a field of work with a specialized vocabulary, you won't find everything you need in it 
 I tried to listen to this story on CD, and aside from the story not being terribly interesting, I was surprised at Asimov's attitude towards religion. I suppose I shouldn't have been. He is a sci fi writer, after all. But I thought he was supposed to be a smart guy. He's not -- at least on this point.   The basic outline of the story (at least the beginning -- I didn't make it all the way through) is that some guy predicts that the galactic empire is going to fall, so he tries to make provision to preserve technology so that the succeeding dark ages don't last as long as they otherwise might. Toward that end he gets a select group of scientists onto this relatively isolated planet where they can carry on their work, which becomes the invention and maintenance of a religion that's supposed to preserve certain technologies through the coming dark ages. In this religion the high priests understand the theory -- the technology and all that -- but the local priests and the people are duped into believing in some mumbo jumbo.   It's as if you're supposed to picture some priest waving incense and saying prayers while he adjusts the knobs on the nuclear reactor, believing that it's God doing something while it's really just technology.   I know that "technology as magic" and "religion = magic" are common themes in the sci-fi genre, but for some reason I expected better from Asimov. It shows a rather alarming lack of thought.   Religious rituals are always geared towards the chaotic and the mysterious. There aren't religious rituals to cause the sun to rise, because it's regular and dependable, but there are religious rituals for storms and floods and harvests and childbirth and whatnot. Religion is also used to explain hidden things -- psychology, forgiveness, etc.   IOW, religion is subject to criticism ("it's not measurable") in precisely the area where Asimov is trying to squeeze it. He's trying to make religion the mystical cloak for something that's regular, predictable and logical. It just doesn't work that way.   If religious rituals had precise, measurable results, people would suspect that there's nothing religious or mysterious about them and they'd look for a material cause. Anyone who doubts that simply doesn't understand the religious mind, or hasn't been paying attention. Sure, there are gullible religious folk out there who'll believe anything, but the majority have half an eye out for tricks and deceptions.   The very idea that you can hide technology behind a cloak of religious ritual is a rather silly science fiction writer's fantasy.  Anyway, the story wasn't that compelling, and this "religious cover for nuclear technology" business was so incredibly stupid, I couldn't finish it. 
 This movie absolutely disgusted me!  It's a hideous thinly disguised sado/masochist film.  Whoever produced the movie needs to get some help.  Way too much time was spent showing us the sexual details involved in these horrible murders as if the film maker savored the acts.  It almost seemed like a porn film. 
  The first few pages grab my attention however the story involved far too much historical information and description. This writer loses his reader by not bringing the hero back into the story almost at the end of the book after a long absence. The hero was the main reason I bought the book in the first place, he didn't reappear for almost three hundred pages later. 
 I fell in love with Matthew Reilly's fast paced, action packed writing style with Area 7.  Since then I read Ice Station, Scarecrow, Temple, Contest, and now 7 Daily Wonders. Wonders was a HUGE let down.  Reilly seemed to allow his plot constructing abilities take a back seat to a Indiana Jones, run through traps, scenario that seldom made any sense throughout the entire book. The plot was more of a "Let me give the characters an excuse to run through the corniest traps I can think of" than it was actually well written or well executed.  In truth, I was SO reminded of "Pitfall" on the Atari 2600 that I found the book boring.   Even with the suspension of disbelief of "How do all these traps work after 4000 years?" I still wasn't happy with the do or die atmosphere that everything hinged on. On top of that, VERY unlike ALL of his other books, this book was a poorly veiled statement on his disagreement of current American military actions.  It came across as very anti-American and almost told me that he hated Americans.  I almost threw the book away during some rants of ethic superority, and America "sacrificing" troops "just to test the waters".  As to those who say, "Why not anti-American when normally it's anti-someone else?"  I say this.  This book attacked America as a people, as a culture, as a complete ideology.  Other books have bad guys/groups that are obviously separate entities from their cultures.  This book mentioned many many times how America is a country of war-mongerers, and the population really wants nothing but global dominance.  A far cry from having specific special forces units butt heads in a search for dominance.   Congratulations, Reilly, I doubt I will give you another chance 
 So, being a fan of all forms of literature, more specifically challenging[faulkner], pretentious[d.h. lawrence] and original[kafka] works, I was surprised at how long it took me to get around to reading what's considered Pynchon's most imporant work.  Important 40 years ago, perhaps, but the test of time has totally obliterated the supposed wit in this one.  Oh man, the radio station is KCUF, boy, that's incredibly clever, I bet it's, like, something spelled backwards.  I fully understand what Pynchon was trying to accomplish with this work, to skewer extreme right wing nut jobs, among other things, all while giving us a story with no particular plot, no moral, no message.  I can understand it, but it doesn't mean it's worth my time, I didn't even finish it.  I read about half and then just dropped it to the floor.  I've read in numerous reviews of Haruki Murakami's work that he's a latter day, Japanese, Pynchon.  I don't agree, Murakami's ability to create a surreal dream-like atmosphere is amazing, Pynchon is a hack 
 I received this for Christmas 2005 as a gift.  The new player out of the box wouldn't hold a charge for longer than 2 minutes no matter how many different ways I tried to play and charge it.  In February 2006 I had to pay Audiovox $60 for a new battery (item was a gift so I did not have original receipt for the warranty).  Now it is October 2006 and the new battery has stopped taking a charge again.  Audiovox informes me that I must pay another $35 to have it fixed again (since I am past the 90 day warranty).  I'm very angry that in order to make it run for more than 10 months, I'm supposed to pay $95, the cost of a new machine.  My husband has a Panasonic portable DVD player that has been running great for 10 years with one battery change so I'm going to look into that brand 
 I was disappointed - I was looking for dance music.  The Confessions on a Dance floor that also purchased was much more useful overall and I think better.  Madonna is reasonably well produced, puts a lot of energy into her work but it is not A work - somewhere between C/B with a few songs B+/A- - Hung Up is actually pretty decent and the single has some interesting re-mixes 
 Okay so I thought this book was supposed to be really great, but when I read it, it seemed very outdated; almost as if it were written hundreds of years ago.  Also, I am so over Ben Franklin.  So, he invented the kite and the can opener. I think that we as a society would have figured those things out for ourselves after a while anyway.   I was looking for some good witty sayings to use when I picked up this book.  Until I turn 75 next year, I will not consider myself old and will not be using any of the outdated sayings or information in this book.  As far as an almanac goes, my arthritic joints do just fine in predicting the weather for me.  In terms of up to date information , I would like to recommend Player Haters by Carl Weber.  
 I have returned this item TWICE. Their tray is not pulling out, so you have to -suck- out the water from it. It doesn't hold all types of coffee, sometimes I had water coming out from the sides, or straight into tray. And I suspect that the pressure is not sustainable because I'm getting different results - sometimes coffee is good, sometimes  you just can't drink this 
 Borrow the book from the library.  Wasting your money on fables is not wise (unless you like wasting money).  While entertaining, this is not worthy of a library collection item 
 I am a professional pet stylist, and when I saw this book advertised in one of the Groomer magazines, I immediately went to Amazon to purchase it.  I was excited to see that someone had actually written a book addressing the issues of grooming "mixed" breeds, a.k.a. Mutts.  Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed.  This book provides no real information.  The author uses drawings of dogs she has groomed in the past.  These drawings are only a 'side' view, and no drawing of the all important head is included.  I am giving this book 2 stars instead of 1 only because the author, at least, attempted to write a book about mutts.  The author simply suggests that you, as a groomer, determine what pure breeds the mutt resembles, and then groom accordingly.  I can tell you that in my shop, I see many mutts that are impossible to determine their lineage.  I was hoping this book detailed the different requirements of grooming a mutt, such as providing details of creating a "Teddy Bear" head on a Shih Tzu, or how to set up a "mane" when doing a strip on an Alaskan Husky.  The book is short on details, and actually gave me NO new information or tips that are not readily available in any one of dozens of pure bred grooming books.  I cannot recommend this book to professional groomers as there is no detail and the drawings are sadly lacking.  I certainly would not recommend this book to the grooming "do-it-yourselfer" as there is no information concerning the basics of grooming such as proper bathing and brushing, etc.  Don't experience the buyers remorse I am experiencing.  I absolutely do NOT RECOMMEND buying this book 
 although the usual elements are there--defender of the faithful searching the heart of darkness (his own) at a crucial point in life (middle age); the good-as-gold woman who gets away; the woman who doesn't--sprinkled with stories cops tell each other. But it drags, as if written to a formula not fully developed. Wambaugh writes well, part Hemingway, part Joseph Conrad. But this adventure story for men misses in all but the gastronomical department 
 "What was he thinking?" was all I could think while watching this ... This is, without a doubt, John Travolta's worst movie since 1978's Moment by Moment with Lily Tomlin. The script is [weak] and the performances are lackluster. Lisa Kudrow, as in every role she plays, is downright annoying with her ever present snarling lip. Travolta is too talented an actor to waste his time on [stuff]like this. It's more suited to a ...comic like Rob Schneider or Adam Sandler. Director Nora Ephron also loses some credibility for having anything to do with this film. .. 
 This is just an article from Harvard Business Review blown up into a book. Get the article reprint and save yourself time and money 
 Like Hayek's Road to Serfdom, this book was written during the Secon World War when Keynes was busy crafting the post war peace. It is infused with the 1930s' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the Communist version more than the Nazi/Fascist version. Keynes is indisputably the 2oth century's most important economist but why does Schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position #2? I put it down to the same reason as Marx' Theory of Alienation gained such sway. As there was little else to salvage from Marx' writings, they hit on that to make him apear relevant. Marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that Schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that Schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history. I see little relevant in his work which I feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction. Unlike Gary Becker and other recipients of the Nobel Prize, Schumpeter tackles big issues. But the big issues shrug him off. Nothing here to ponder over 
 i don't recommend this produc 
 Well, first of all, if I were reading a book about kids, wanting to know about the society of children, I would want to know the author has done the work of raising kids, instead of studying documents of others who studied kids on a makeshift and very temporary basis. There's a great deal of difference between this "pop" psychology writer Hulbert and people who study children, like children, and look for what is good and workable. As I read this book, I kept thinking, how simple it is to write a book about what is wrong, and this is something Hulbert specializes in- according to her, lots of bad ideas exist in the world. This becomes tiresome throughout this book. In a world of cheap pundits everywhere, claiming that everything about everything is wrong, it is refreshing to read instead people like Derrida "the Work of Mourning" which speaks clearly about relationships and how they are made in individual psyches. I think overall, there is so much to be said about kids and relationships between them and with adults that is useful, that this book is unfortunately just is a rehash of each decades "look how bad and stupid people are after all" genre 
 I GIVE UP I LOVE THE DVD BUT CANNOT VIEW AFTER 3 ATTEMPTS THE LAST DISK .. I ALSO HAVE 3 DVDS RANGING FROM GREAT TO JUST OK. SO IT IS NOT MY PLAYERS. I WENT TO ANOTHER STORE AND THE SAME THE LAST OR 4TH DISK DOESNT PLAY SKIPPING ETC . THEY WONT TAKE IT BACK JUST EXCHANGE. I GIVE UP. NEVER TO SEE LAST DIS 
 This was the first Ludlum book I have read.  I bought several and now am thinking I've wasted my money.  He took a realistic story and destroyed it with an unbelievable plot.  All the bad guys, who have so much power that they can have anyone in the world killed within 24 hours of the victim hearing about the Secret Plot to control the World cannot even protect their top masterminds from being kidnapped by a New York lawyer, his consultant ex-wife, and a couple of low-level military officers.  Then, each bad guy willingly spills everything about the Secret Plot merely upon learning that one of his colleagues has insulted him?  Give me a break.  Don't even get me started on how unrealistic the relationship is b/w the main character and his ex-wife.  Give the book as a gift to your 12 year old nieces and nephews, but don't waste your time or money on this if you are over 12 years old 
 The design of this ice cream maker leaves a lot to be desired. Only small cracked or shaved ice will fit around the tub and the plastic lid is already showing signs of wear. 
 First off the company I work for ordered three of these.  One out of the three did not work.  There is no sound comming from the right side and it isn't the speaker as we have tried different speakers.  Amazon will not take it back and will not exchange it for another one.  This is just the start.  The two that do work work very poorly.  The connecotor for the iPod is very flimsey and feels like it will break off.  They give you inserts to use depending on what model iPod you have.  These inserts prevent the iPod from sliding all the way down so when you use them the iPod will not work.  Also, the CD player has a lid that opens with a motor.  Yes, a motor.  So, if you push it down when it is open it will close but this throws off the gears as it is very sensitive and now the damn things don't close all the way.  You need to use the open/close button to prevent this but natural reaction is to push the lid down when it is open.  All of the buttons are very clumbsy and confusing.  The sound is not that great at all!  There are a TON of wires with this thing.  Power, speaker, antenna and iPod firewire type connector all run between the speakers, subwoofer and main unit. This is not a good product and has been a nightmare for my department. 
 The only truth he told was in the front of the original (1830) ed of the Book of Mormon. He lists himself (correctly) as the author and proprietor of the work. Later editions claim his as a translator -- just like he translated the Kinderhook plates.  This "most correct book" contains numerous spelling errors and grammatical errors. Elohim's spell checker must have been off line when Joe was writing this one 
 I am an Ismailli and totally offended by Lewis's book.  He is no doubt a total anti-Muslim racist.  For greater information on the Nizari ismaillis read Farhad Daftar 
 what a joke...people believe the stupidest things...do some research and you will see that this is a joke.  I hated it 
 My 4 1/2 year old son picked this toy out himself.  He was really excited until we got it home and he heard the voice of the mummy.  He refuses to play with it and even wanted to take it back to the store because it scared him so much.  Definitely not recommended for younger children 
 Please do not waste your time or money on this item, unless you have money to burn.  Don't get me wrong, the car charger part of the kit is great, but the modulator for radio frequency is horrible.  It provides substandard sound, no matter what format you have your audio in.  I tried multiple frequencies, multiple formats, and every setting on the zune itself, it's just horrible.  I am returning mine ASAP.  I cannot justify spending 70 bucks on such a terrible item.  Hope this helps someone else 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 I purchased this CD for only one song, Una Palabra by Carlos Varela.  It is the very first track.  Come to find it is a shortened version of the original song.  The full version is 2 minutes and 27 seconds.  The version on the soundtrack is 1 minute and 14 seconds.  Why someone would want to cut 73 seconds off such a short but beautiful song is a travesty.  Why it's madness, I tell you...and my soul demands justice!  Luckily I was able to find the full version on the internet, but of course that was $14 later.  All kidding aside, it's not a bad CD entirely...if you're into that Harry Gregson-Williams hooty-tooty crap.  As a matter of fact, I encourage you to get into him.  Just so happens I got a CD for sale if you're interested.  Say...$13.99 
 I too am horrified that this author is capitalizing on her first-hand expereince as a murderer.  Would you want to support Charles Manson or other murderers by buying their books? Buying a book written by a murderer is condoning their activities and agreeing they should profit from their crime.  I can't support that.  This woman manipulated her friend into helping her murder her friend's murder and then used her own wealthy family's lawyers to get a light sentence while her friend wasted away in prison 
 If you think you'd find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting, then you'll enjoy this book. 
 I did not buy this book; I looked it over at the bookstore and decided against purchasing it.  The thing that didn't make sense to me is that praying the rosary is basically a christian thing. I agree with the other reviewer, he throws some new age stuff in there.  He also said that a friend of his who was Jewish prayed on the rosary, which really doesn't make sense to me, since In the book the prayer for the rosary is stating that Jesus Christ is your savior and Jewish people do not believe in Jesus as the son of God and savior. I don't know if that is the same prayer as the Catholics use or what.  
 Ms. Castillo's novel should have been incredibly interesting to me, since I am a Hispanic Literature buff and have recently become quite interested in Chicano Literature, but I found this novel tedious and poorly constructed.  The idea of reading the novel in different orders has been USED, as is obvious to any who has read Hopscotch (Rayuela) by Julio Cortázar, and it was best left alone for future use.  Castillo's use of the technique doesn't even match up to the level of a "Choose Your Own Adventure", because the three different reading leave you feeling exactly the same way, BORED.  She makes her novel rest completely on the lives of her characters, but then she doesn't really ever develop them enough for you to become interested.  I never felt like I got to know them hardly at all.  I was a bit disappointed, but I suppose this book could have some attaction to Chicana women who can identify a bit more with the characters.  Maybe being a Chicana woman would help a reader to fill in all the blanks and holes that Castillo leaves in her characterizations 
 This entirely absurd treatise on the "nobility of old wealth" is the most ludicrous piece ever written by a fully deluded and perverse individual.  He attempts to convince us that "Old Money" is somehow tied in with the betterment and refinement of culture, of artistic values and family mores and a sense of "community values".  I scoff at the very idea that the "wealthy" are any more perceptive or beneficial than those he calls the "rabble" at the bottom rung, their sole difference is that they are insular, arrogant, unsound and can effectively manipulate the corrupt system in place in the social world.  They live in a world of delusion, segregated from the perception of the common man and of their own finality.     Entirely avoiding any attachment with reality or historical manifestations, the author rambles on, endorsing us with his vision of the world as a "better place with wealth".  He avoids the mitigation of corruption, political scheming, murderous exploitation of workers, and unethical urgency in the characteristics of the wealthy.  Don't waste your time with this unless you want to laugh, pick up Karl Marx again, its a more enriching read.  Long live the proletarian 
 This book is definitely not another Woman in White or The Moonstone, both wonderfully well-written mysteries.  For those who absolutely have to read every word that Collins wrote, this book is recommended.  The plot is fairly boring and the characters fairly uninteresting.  Overall, a slow and somewhat dull read 
 You'll never get the straight story about nationalism out of Eric Hobsbawm, who himself appears to try to reconcile his own ethnic identity with the topic.  David Pryce-Jones once noted that in Hobsbawm's own autobiography: "he [Hobsbawm] boasts of a visit to Bir Zeit University on the West Bank to display solidarity with the Palestinians.  Why Palestinian nationalism is valid, and Jewish nationalism invalid, is something else Hobsbawm fails to analyze and explain. Quite crudely, he approves of nationalism in countries which proclaim themselves Communist and anti-American, like Cuba or Vietnam, while rejecting nationalism in countries which are not Communist and are pro-American, like Israel" ([...], Jan. 3, 2003).  Such twisted thinking is evident through "Nations and Nationalism," where Mr. Hobsbawm spares no effort, however subtle, to demean nationalism that doesn't conform to his pre-existing prejudices.  In short, when writing about nationalism, Mr. Hobsbawm allowed his considerable analytic and writing skills to become corrupted by his religion, communism.  Therefore, unless you are an acolyte of that religion, this book is not worth your time, money or effort to read, and if you *are* a member of that religion, I suggest you broaden your intellectual horizons a bit, perhaps by reading Liah Greenfield's "Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity" or Benedict Anderson's "Imagined Communities. 
 My kids started reading the Left Behind Kids books, and because I was concerned about the message and theology of the books, I started reading them also.  Then I decided to check out the "adult" books from the library.   I am a born-again, pentacostal believer in Jesus Christ, and parts of the theology are not what I read in the Bible.  OK.  I can stil enjoy a good book, one with interesting characters, realistic dialogue, and a good plot.  The issue of plot is difficult for the Left Behind books, I admit, because we know who wins if we've read the end of the New Testament.  As to the rest, it fell flat.  Most of the dialogue didn't ring true.  After a few of the books, I was interested in some of the characters, but by the end of the books, there were only a few of the original characters left, and they were some of the least interesting to begin with.  How many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in Revelation?  How many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in Book 1?  There is nothing new and interesting in this book. The last book is just boring.    It would have been nice, at the end of the book, to wrap up everything.   Jesus comes back, and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over, right?  Some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all.  It was an incredible let down.  I felt like I had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over.  Nothing.  We stick with that one main guy, and everyone else is left in the dust.  It should have had a really, really happy ending, but even that was boring.  If I had my time back, I would stick to the kid versions, if only to discuss theological issues with my children.  At least in the kid books, the sermons are shorter.  And I will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series 
 This book is unorganized, out-of-date, too focused on New York City, and on every other page promotes the authors and their careers...On page 7 they are telling you how much has changed with the computer age, and the internet, and one of the authors tells you he went to grade school and they used quill pens and fountain jars...okay, I didn't need to know that.  It was so annoying that by page 14, I was going to submit to them a list of improvements, but it would have been EXTENSIVE!  From there on just gritted my teeth and got through it...Good luck!  You'll be really tired of the references to the Trade City Bombing, and NYC in general, by the end of it 
 I just purchased this book, and I was really excited when I received it.  However, after 5 attempts of trying to install the CD-ROM, I gave up, and... the worest thing is, I tried to visit the website the book provided, in order to get to contact with them & ask for help... I was not allowed to view the page... cuz they blocked a lot of IP address, and the cable company that I have is on their list.........   If you want to get a USEFUL CD-ROM for drug reference, don't get this book... it will cause you a lot of headache & troubles.  Get Nursing200X drug handbook published by Springhouse.  The software is good, and I never had any problem with it 
 I purchased this book in the expectation that it would expand on FMP's online help.  However, I was disappointed in that it only covers the basics, doesn't add to what's available in FMP's online help.  Index insufficient to quickly access information sought.  Lacks sufficient examples of applications 
 I purchased this book because it was recommeneded to me. I started the book and quickly stopped because it was tough to read. I then went on to read other books such as "Adventure Capitalist" by Jim Rogers that involved world travel on the ground. When I came back to this book, I discovered what the problems were. Perhaps it's best if I quote other reviewer's here: Kaplan is "very well-grounded in historical and contextual reading" and "he is well-read". That's the problem. Kaplan spends most of his time telling us what other people think. He goes off on tangents and leaves me wondering what it is that Kaplan himself thinks. Another reviewer wrote "sometimes it is not quite the easiest read". It is tough reading even if you are familar with the places Kaplan is talking about. And finally, "IT IS NOT HIS BEST. THE MEANDERING, STOP AND GO, RABBIT TRAIL PROGRESS OF THE BOOK WAS A BIT DISTRACTING AND FRUSTRATING FOR ME" sums it up for me. So, if you found the fact that I quoted other people distracting then you'll understand what it is that I didn't like about Kaplan's book. I suggest "Adventure Capitalist" as an alternative 
 I must say that this album is a huge disappointment. Having promised so much with Electric World and Beyond the Thunder, this is a step in the wrong direction.  Sure Neal is as crisp and virtuoso as usual, but one expects a little more creativity and soul. It seems that many a talented guitarist become obsessed with "fret board diarrhoea". To quote the great Miles Davies, "it's not how fast you talk, but what you say that counts".  Neal is clearly out to compete with the likes of Vai and Satriani. Perhaps for commercial reasons, maybe a pat on the back, who knows 
 Mmmmm...I really don't know how I feel about this particular version of the Bible...it is actually kind of weird...it really is...I know that it's trying to get more and more people to read it and understand it, but I really don't think this book does it...at least, not for me it didn't.  The only translation that really does it for me, is the Lamsa Bible. It is translated from the original Aramaic...which, by the way, is the language that Jesus actually spoke. Did you know that "Abba" actually means, "Good Daddy"...it also means "Bad 70s music..." just kidding...but yeah, when Jesus called God, Abba, he was basically saying, My Good Daddy provides me with everything I could want and need, which, of course, drove the scribes crazy and which would probably drive some "Christians" crazy if they really understood the Aramaic language.  Not that I do, mind you...I'm not an Aramaic Scholar by any stretch of the imagination, but I have studied books by Rocco Errico and his mentor, George Lamsa.   So, no, I can't say that I really recommend this particular version of the Bible. It doesn't jive well wit da soul and all dat...y'know, what I'm sayin'...  Me neither.. 
 The problem with Alexandra's books is that once you've read one, you've  read them all. I purchased Living a Beautiful Life and it has the same  Grace Notes inside that others reference in her other books, like...Decant  your mouthwash, Splurge on Flowers, etc. Did she actually forget she  already gave us those hints years ago or what 
 If you're a beginner or not interested in physics stay away from this book. Its mostly geared towards people with high interest and a good reference. Otherwise, the book is very boring to read and all they do is throw formulas at you. Stay away at all costs 
 I was very disappointed in the book. Unfortunately, there's at least as much ranting from the author about his views of what's wrong with the political left, and as much of his glorifying of the political right, as there is info about blogs.  Info about blogs seemed to be only a backdrop from which to share his strong right-wring political views.  If you are a strong right-winger, buy the book.  Otherwise, if you are a centrist, on the left, or interested primarily in blogs, don't buy this book.  
 This quick-read is a cheap thrill. It has some eloquent prose and an interesting premise; however, the story as a whole is marginal and actually quite banal. The author seems almost desperate to convey "realism", but relying on photographic descriptions of sexual acts and equally graphic renditions of sadistic brutality are simply not enough to make this story exceptional.   The protagonist, Frannie, is "too constructed" to seem real. Her extreme cynicism is perhaps refreshing at times and her linguistic ponderings are often quite amusing, but overall her personality is meatless. The lover/detective Malloy is a tired police cliche with a knack for some extreme sexual precision. Frannie's student Cornelius shows some potential as a character but quickly disintegrates.  The ending is quite over-hyped and actually rather disappointing. Blood and gore and a meager "explaination" - wow, what a surprise...  Overall, Susanna Moore shows us in this book that she can be clever with words; however, her attempt to portray gritty reality comes across as merely desperate for attentio 
 I REALLY,REALLY HATE FOREIGNER AND I RANK THEM AS BAD AS GREEN DAY.DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS DISGUSTINGLY AWFUL CD WHICH CONTAINS TRASH LIKE WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU WHICH HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST MORONIC AND STUPID SONGS EVER.GET ANY LED ZEPPELIN ALBUM INSTEAD 
 I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it. Instead, rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story, made you want to read the next page, and perhaps, in the end, changed your view of the world 
 This is one of the most boring CD's I've ever bought.  Its as if for political reasons the music was cranked out as background to now fairly mainstream anti-war lyrics.  It sounds so computer generated.  Did they really have a drummer or was a drum machine used on every song?  Were the guitar sounds recorded 40 years ago and then mixed into the songs?  If you want anti-Iraq war listen to the Dixie Chicks. 
 If you're wondering what happened to Beck Weathers after he was rescued from Everest in 1996... keep wondering. This inappropriately titled book focuses on the climb itself and Beck's life story, with almost no details on how Beck managed to surmount the terrible injuries he suffered while climbing Everest. Details of the climb itself occupy about 1/3rd of the book; 109 of it's 335 pages. It's the same story you've already read in "Into Thin Air", "The Climb", "High Exposure", and numerous magazine articles. Beck's telling is more informal and provides less detail than those other sources. Interspersed with Beck's narrative are occasional quotes from his wife, family, friends, or other participants in the climb(e.g. Charlotte Fox and Madan K.C.). Ultimately, this portion of the book proves unsatisfying if you're read any other material concerning the 1996 climbing season on Everest. The remainder of the book covers Beck's life story: his family life, difficulties with depression, family and marriage problems, and previous climbs. Those who bought "Left for Dead" with an interest in mountain climbing will be disappointed with the rather short descriptions of Beck's previous climbs. The final chapter, say 40 pages, describes the surgeries and rehabilitation needed to recover from the injuries suffered on Everest, along with family life at the time, and the death of his wife's brother. Again, the chapter moves along quickly without much detail. While this book is somewhat entertaining, it reads like a transcription of several hours of telephone interviews with all the limitations that implies; one wonders if co-author Stephen Michaud was simply the typist who transcribed these conversations. In the end, while you may have learned a bit more about Beck Weathers and what he went through on and after Everest, he still remains largely an enigma. 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 I will admit that Paula is inspirational BUT she doesn't give you enough time to "learn" the move before putting you in full gear. I loved the music and Paula's upbeat personality but felt it moved way too fast. This video will definitely get your heart a pumpin' 
 My daughter just got this doll for her 3rd birthday. We tried two sets of batteries and it never swam. She enjoys playing with it anyway. But the top is a pain to put back on. I hope my friend did not spend a lot of money on this gift. I do not recommend buying it 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 Highly recommended,but,to many scenes of men bobbing around in a life boat. Little action scenes and those that were seen were not believable 
 I love cheesey horror films from the late 60's/early/70's. With that being said I was very dissapointed watching this movie. It's bad. Not bad in a good cheesey way, but bad as in almost impossible to watch. Here are my reasons why:  -The music. My god, I have never heard such wrong music for a movie. When I see people getting killed I know that I want to hear soft James Taylor type music. It added nothing to the atmosphere of the film, and in fact hurt it.  -The editing. I have never seen such bad editing. One moment one of the victims is across a large creek from her attacker, and the next the attacker is on the same side chasing her again. I could go on, but there are so many editing goofs that I would be here all night describing them.  -The screenplay. The situation itself could have been believable if the dialogue , and scenes, had been better written. As it is the entire situation seemed really unbelievable. It makes me wonder how this film ever got made.  -The acting. None of the story was believable because the acting was so awful. As I said before I love cheesey movies. Sometimes that includes bad acting, but when it is combines with the above stated faults it makes it a horrible thing to witness.  The reviewer who said that this is an important horror film has got to be kidding me. Hammer horror films from the same era are important. AP horror films from this era are important. This film? It should be forgotten and avoided at all costs. I knew that there was a reason why I have never liked Wes Craven's movies 
 If you like science fiction you may enjoy this book. But if you are looking for a good nonfiction book about science/physics, I recommend you look elsewhere. This book is too wordy and too long for what it is attempting to explain. Krauss' other works are much better 
 I was extremely disappointed by this album. It just didn't grab me at all like Fallen did. It has no outstanding tracks or anything much memorable. I guess Nightwish has spoiled me. Before, Evanescence was about the only female-fronted band I cared to listen to. Now that I have discovered Nightwish, Evanescence just seems useless. Sorry, but I just don't care for it 
 I gave up on this book after 2 chapters. The problem I have with this book is not the author's point of view as different points of view can lead to new ways of looking at the same information.  But the author is so fixed on reaching his conclusions that he doesn't just bend the facts to reach his conclusions but makes wild jumps. It reminds me of the professor where on the blackboard at one point in his equation has "and a miracle occurs."  Case in point, he discusses arguments about how Roosevelt may have tried to force Japan to attack the U.S. to drag us in to WWII. He views everything from that viewpoint. And then, instead of saying that there is a strong argument that Roosevelt tried to get Japan to attack us, his conclusion is that Roosevelt unequivocably forced Japan to attack us.  And then he made the same claim that Roosevelt forced Germany to also declare war on the U.S. And in the case of this conclusion, basically didn't even bring up any strong arguments.  Viewpoints I disagree with that are intelligently reasoned I love to read as they make me think. But random conclusions reached solely on the author's biases are a waste of paper 
 THE ONLY REASON I EVER ORDERED THESE PANS IS BECAUSE THEY COME WITH THE LIDS.. !!.. Pans this size are hard to find lids for & for the PRICE aren't WORTH it without LIDS... This pan as decribed is to come with LIDS. But I've ordered them twice 4 pans in all & still no LIDS.. So I'm requesting a Refund this time.. I have purchased many of these pans from this company & they are very nice . Well worth the Price.. TOO BAD THIS PAGE IS MISLEADING.. I'm Ready when they get LIDS!! Reason for only two stars is NO LIDS... The Pan Rocks. 
 This book touts itself as a valuable lesson on the horrors of war but there are many more appropriate ways of broaching this discussion with small children than to bombard them with a dreary, depressing and grotesque tale of animal cruelty and suffering. I don't recommend this book for children OR adults. There are many better books, such as "Johnny Tremain" or "The Diary of Anne Frank" that bring home the point of suffering without grisly, needlessly graphic descriptions of animal cruelty that are completely age-INappropriate. 
 I should have shopped more carefully - I just want to read everything David Sedaris has written.  This is a 50-page play, which is entertaining and would be great, if it was longer and more detailed.  It's super-condensed 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 I bought the magazin on november, and I don't recive it yet 
 When I saw this in the library, I guess I was expecting another version of The Nanny Diaries, which was cute. This "novel," however, was poorly written and jumped all over the place; there were no smooth transitions at all. It was basically one big promo of her company--any time she mentioned a "horror story" she was quick to add that it wasn't one of HER nannies. Basically, I thought it was boring and that the writing style emulated that of the 3rd graders I teach. It took me about an hour to read, after which I thought, "How did THAT get published?" If you want to read a nanny book, try the Nanny Diaries. This book is stupid. 
 I picked up this book because the story looked interesting; little did I know that this book would be so horrible I would put it down in the middle.  Good grief!  Unfortunately, Gail Tsukiyama has a nasty habit of writing choppy books.  She'll touch on one idea for about a page, never really going in-depth, then move on.  In addition, the characters all seemed one-dimensional and never convinced me to care about them.  As a result, Gail Tsukiyama's work came off as very amateur-ish and unworthy of my time.  For good fiction about Asian women, please read some of Amy Tan's older works or Arthur Golden's Memoirs of a Geisha.  
 This book is, in hindsight, horribly wrong. It is now known that there are no WMD's in Iraq. Saddam did not pose a threat to America and the world at-large. It's just sad that the trumpeters of the Iraqi war were playing to the wrong song. It's packed with faulty and "highly dubious" intelligence. The CIA has since admitted as much but I do not expect as much from a hack writting a book to profit from a "massive intelligence failure" 
 This book is merely a hundred something pages long and yet 99% of what the two authors said are in defense of the traditional church doctrine. The only credit they gave Dan Brown is the fact that he stirs up the debates reguarding Mary Magdelene. That's it. The rest are just praises of how the church's version of the history makes better sense, has more morality and is more ethically-oriented. They completely dismissed any Gnostic ideas. You don't need to waste a few dollars on this book when you can attend the church for free and have the pastor tell you the same things 
 This is BAD BAD movei! IT SO BAD that my tooths huyrt!!! Too much pain... I cannot speaks very well englich because MIGHTY APRODITYE is like MIGHTY LOBODOMY to my brainbs!! Avoid! avoid! aviod!! And plese rate my review "very heplful" so that EVERYONE reads HOW BAD Mr. Woody Alan is!!! THanks you and god Blesses 
 This is the worst 'How To' book I have ever read...The author never makes a definitive statement about anything. Instead he says you could do this or that, hire someone or do it yourself, blah blah blah. He rambles on about the same subjects repetitively to fill up the pages. I feel like I have not learned anything of any use after reading the entire book. What a major disappointment 
 sympathize with the storyteller or the subject.  They both seemed too cold.  ...this well has lukewarmness.    I wanted to walk away from this bio having found out cool little anticdotes and I'll I got was the story of two men who couldn't find their way in this world 
 If this movie was ever going to have a chance, it needed to be about 4 or 5 hours long, or never attempted in the first place. Some books adapt well to being edited and condensed as a screenplay - Possession just can't be dealt with that way. What you have as a result is another story entirely. There just wasn't time enough, I guess, to develop the characters, or even to include half of them. The only character true to the book and left almost intact was Sir George. The rest were stripped of their layers and everything that made them fascinating, and we are left with painful stereotypes and, in the case of Roland Michell, a character who seems to have wandered on to the wrong set during filming. My best advice is that if you've read the book, skip the movie, but if you saw the movie, you should do yourself a favor and get the book 
 If you are looking for some help in deciding whether to start a career in trucking, this book won't help you (unless you need some emergency toilet paper for the ride).  For one...it's outdated and two...it's full of whining and moaning about the good ole' days before deregulation.  A thinly disguised "analysis" of what happened turns into a full fledged tantrum about the injustice of it all.  If you don't want to truck then DON'T...go work at the Waffle House 
 I saw this book when I was a child and wanted to read it then (it had a cool cover with a kind of blimp/airship on it).  Unfortunatley, life intervened and I only got around to reading it just recently.  Alas!  This book was a lot better and more wonder-filled in my imagination than it actually turned out to be.  The story is not very interesting, the setting is not well-painted, the protagonist's adventures are pedestrian, and the whole thing is swiss-cheesed with so much British slang as will likely put an American kid off his feed.  Skip this one 
 This book is terrible for the quant who wants to learn some technical stuff about MBS and ABS (for example, prepayment model or default model ....). I know the authors are doing business to sell their prepayment model. But I don't think that's the good reason that this book contains nothing more than MBS/ABS overview. If you want market/product overview, maybe this book is the answer 
 I have read many books relating to ads & advertising and found this one to contain no value, no guidance, no tips and NO SECRETS.   Many old tales and short quotes that offered no insight to modern day marketing and advertising. There are many good books out there, unfortunately for me and my pocketbook this is not one of them 
 I loved the look of the boot.  The price was great. I guess you get what you pay for.  They run a size small.  There is also some sort of design flaw with the zipper function and location.  You break out in a sweat trying to get the boots on and off. Believe me, I tried.  I really wanted to keep the boots based on the look.  Once on, they were really awkward to walk around in because the wedge had no give at all.  I am pretty good in heels being in a band and always wearing some kind of trendy shoe.  I tend to be pretty easy.  I just could not make these work!  Sorry 
 I bought one of these and returned it a couple days later (from an electronics store - much more expensive than @ Amazon).  While it had many qualities I was looking for, like the thick, protected connector for the ipod instead of a dangling wire, this unit just didn't do a good job of holding a charge.  I followed all the instructions, charge it overnight, etc. but still it would only give and extra hour or so battery life to my 40 gig ipod.  As tempting as this one is, I'd say pass and find one with proven ability to hold a charge 
 The book deals with the conflicts between the moon people who are destined to die as the moon becomes airless, and the space people who are immortal and plan to go on to another star when the fuel project for which the moon was built is completed.  We are used to conflicts between groups of people, but in this case the moon people are the children of the space people.  Can you imagine raising a child to do your work and then to be abandoned to die? I could not suspend my disbelief that far 
 What is the point of this book?  I found it extremely disappointing.  I was looking forward to a Buffy/Angel crossover as I love both these characters...unfortunately this book seemed to be all about how wonderful and sexy Sam is.  I mean, who cares?!  If you bought this book it is likely that you are a fan of Buffy and/or Angel so why the hell would you be interested in hearing all about a minor character who appeared once on Buffy for the sole purpose of exploring how Buffy felt about her ex (her one tenuous link to normality) being totally lost to her?  I got the distinct feeling that this author doesn't really know Buffy and Angel all that well.  The characters could have been anyone and I had a hard time picturing Buffy and Angel doing the things these characters do.  Buffy just as a van driver?  Come on!  If you are a fan of Sam (and if there are any out there I would love to hear from them!) and would love her to get together with Angel (bizarre!) then this book will be a dream come true.  However, if you are a Buffy/Angel fan don't touch it 
 I bought this book because I thought it sounded interesting and funny.  While it was both of these, halfway through I found myself wondering why I wasted my money.  Look these facts up on the internet if you really want to know them because the book isn't worth it's price 
 This one was a huge disappointment. I've read Petersen's essays and they're not bad. But in Writing Naturally the prose is clumsy and cliched; the chapters focus on the most elementary writing topics. He makes absurd and insulting suggestions. For example, he advises readers to avoid Thoreau because the "archaic" prose is "a tough row to hoe." I expected content on how to use natrual imagery for metaphic purpose, or techniques on observation and description. Instead I got a chapter on tense and point of view. He puts down other authors who load their writing books with their own writing, then he does exactly that himself! If you are a beginning writer who needs good, concrete information, I suggest you spend your money on a subscription to Writer's Digest or another monthly magazine that deals with the basics. You'll get much more value for your money 
 This book is way overated.  Its way-out, wacky treament of electronics could definitely not be that of any well thought-of engineer.  It's frankly just a bunch of goofy unsystematic mumbo-jumbo by some over-educated self-proclaimed "physicists."   So imagine my surprise when I read a translation of this in Russian.  I think the whole world must have been duped.  Do yourself a favor.  Go read the Smith book (see my other reviews) and avoid this one like the plague 
 I find that it doesn't slide easily, even when the seal is oiled (which you have to do whenever you wash it, a bit of a pain). I was excited about getting it because Alton uses one on his show, but I never use it -- I just use my regular old-fashioned measuring cups and use a rubber spatula to get the sticky ingredients out.  Also it's hollow on the inside so if you wash it in a dishwasher, and you want the soiled part towards the water, the hollow part is facing up and gets filled with dirty dish water 
 This book is infuriatingly opinionated; and Fadiman spends a lot of energy and space insulting great writers and saying stupid things. He seems more intent on placing his writers into a bogus hierarchy than actually appreciating them.  Many of his judgements are simply wrong 
 This adapter would not work AT ALL in my 1996 Ford Ranger.  The vehicle's cassette player kept ejecting it.  However, it DID work in a co-worker's 1993 Ford Ranger.  It also would not work in a 1993 Monte Carlo...same problem 
 I was reading the review written below that indicated that this book gives the conservative perspective on the war in Iraq.  You couldn't be more wrong.   This book gives you the NEO-CONSERVATIVE perspetive for going to war.  And as with anything the neo cons try to sell you (see the Weekly Standard, Commentary magazine or anything written by Richard Perle or Robert Kagan), this is more propaganda than it is fact.  This book was clearly written to promote a war that this small, but influential political faction have been pushing for since the early 90s.   If you want a CONSERVATIVE perspective on all this, pick up Pat Buchanan's "Where the Right Went Wrong" or the recently released book from Scott Ritter.  The "Neo-Conned" series is also a good starting point.  
 We were disappointed in this DVD and thought it was a waste of money. We did not learn anything new.   They went through things quickly, everything was so basic, things that are mainly common sense.  I felt this was a big huge waste of money, and is now in the trash 
 The clear plastic windows of the sleeves emit a strong chemical smell.  I bought two boxes; both boxes stank.  Maybe if you pay a little more you get the non-stinky kind.  You get red, orange, yellow, green and blue sleeves, 10 of each 
 Recently I was woken up to the sound of Tower of Power, playing "Happy about that", and I was very impressed.  I had never heard of this group, and a little surfing revealed all.  I promptly ordered "Oakland Zone" and listened to it with great anticipation.  It was at this point that I realised why the radio station chose to play "Happy about that" - it is the only track on the CD worth listening to (settle down you soul experts, I am obviously a newbie here).  Seriously though - the one track is very polished and pleasing to the ear, while the remainder of the tracks are nothing but a bunch of what I would class as "B" sides.  I expect T.O.P. have produced far better in the past - I must give them another chance I guess 
 I was under the impression that the book would give a step by step process of creating a CD, if that is what you are looking for, keep looking. It is a 500+ page tome dedicated to the history of the CD & DVD industry and deals in generalities when addressing the possibility of creating a CD 
 I was disappointed in the book. It lacked some of what had been promised in the way of scientific documention, etc. Just another variation on the numerous spin-offs of the Atkins/South Beach approach 
 Ignatieff's credibility, particularly in the field of human rights, is forever tarnished by his marked appeasement of Serb ethnic cleansers in Bosnia several years ago. It is only because Bosnia was ignored, and those responsible never held accountable, that their appeasers still publish and get read. I recommend, for those who want some perpective on Ignatieff, to read his works pertaining to the Balkans written during the period 1992-1995 
 I thought "End of Racism" would be about how to *end* the very real phenomena of racism that is based on the inexistent concept of 'race' (see any encyclopaedia). Instead, the book seems to continue the disease, but in a new form. For what? So it can take us another few centuries to identify the problem in its mutated form before we actually try to solve it? As for stupid and dangerous ideas like different peoples being more inferior/superior than others - what nonsense! Such lies leave an awful taste in my mouth. I find that the book just perpetuates ignorance and it might do worse if taken seriously: cause new troubles.  I have never lived in or visited America, and must ascribe my knowledge of its social situations to just the local TV. But I feel the situation of African Americans to some extent has parallels in the unhappy state other peoples find themselves in: Native Americans, the Maori people of New Zealand, the indigenous peoples of South Africa, the Australian Aboriginals, the Gypsies etc. Although the symptoms are different in each case (in some communities, the reaction is violence or breaking the law, in others it is drinking or an unwillingness to conform), the causes might be similar. These are all peoples who have been been separated from their traditions, cultures, etc., most often in very violent and oppressive ways. Other cultures, foreign to theirs, have been imposed on them.  Isn't it possible, that like a grown-up still dealing with trauma endured in childhood, a community as a whole can be going through the same thing? Having only studied about the terrible centuries of slavery, I can but imagine its impact in making a community feel devalued. It can hardly be surprising that the past affects the present, the grown-up still trying to come to terms with his unfortunate youth. Different communities in such countries might live in the same present, but their pasts are different, and can be very influential in how each copes with current situations. Removing the centuries-long traumatic effects of slavery or other oppression in what is still a very short time would be hard. This would be even more difficult, if not impossible, if the wrong methods were used to try to heal the effects of past wrongs. As for positive discrimination, I don't see it working in most cases. Of course, I like the idea of special scholarships, funding and extra help in unfamiliar territory like `getting a job' for those who just finished school. But not positive discrimination on one side and pushing back the previously-favoured on the other. This only segregates current generations, and can lead to future resentment.  It would be good to look into whether the cause for present difficulties in these cases is *because of* human communities having been separated from their original cultures. In many countries, people have been robbed of their millennia-old wisdom and traditions, and so are now unable to go back to the teachings of their communities. Having their pasts erased, a feeling of not belonging or even resentment is only natural. Once they were allowed to go back to their traditions, Maori in New Zealand have become much more accepting of and comfortable in the present society. They also have a better overall well-being, because of the support given by being part of their own ancestral form of society. Maybe in America, this could be the case as well? As more Native Americans go back to their spiritual roots and spend time in their communities, their overall well-being could also increase. They might not have the feeling of loss, of a robbed past, because they have a living present and future. And perhaps if there are African-Americans wishing to investigate their animist roots, they might find a peace and hope in their ancient philosophical beliefs and myths. I can very much believe that it is when people's traditions have been forcibly stolen, their past erased, their original communities violently disbanded, that they lose any chance of happiness and do not really have the ability to truly live for a future. (Unless they've found some other culture to replace it with, which they think equally-acceptable). With former-colonies, it's slightly different. In my own country of India, people have been mistreated and oppressed for centuries. Eg. According to British records, 25 million Indians died between 1800 and 1900 (this is only a portion of the time that they were in charge), without the British caring much. Many of the deaths were because of famine, induced by the Crown taking away desperately needed provisions or hiking prices so that people couldn't afford them. India's people were able to move on after Independence, even if only just, because they were able to fall back on culture: they had managed to hang on to it. It's a slow process of healing, and one day we'll be fine.  If any other peoples had undergone the slavery and torments that African-American people suffered, the former would be in the plight that the latter are now in. As it is, I wonder that African-Americans have been diligently trying, and often succeeding, to reconcile the past with the present - in spite of past wrongs. I do believe that the solution to current difficulties lies in their hands themselves (although everyone else can help if so willing and able). They have to search for what kind of culture they need that can help them in the present, what kind of community they require to rebuild their confidence and support them with exorcising the difficulties they had faced. I don't mean a new form of segregation keeping sub-communities of America separate, I just mean a culture or traditions African-Americans can turn to for guidance, that understands them uniquely. Perhaps looking to their roots in African animism might provide starting points. Celebrating their far-off past, but also their current identity as Americans.   Unfortunately, in Africa at least, the end of racism is not in sight. Around the start of the 20th century, 80% of Africa was still animistic. In the 1980s/90s, this was only 30%. I shudder to guess what it might be now. Soon people with African ancestry can't even look back with love, admiration and pride at where they came from, what their ancestors knew, their heritage. No longer will *anyone* be able to look for inspiration at what had been there relatively unchanged for millennia.  And as for Sudan, for a long while now - much longer than the news has informed the masses of, a deadly war has been raging. Here, one religion is using unspeakable violence to punish 'incorrectly practising' followers and to force-convert the rest of the population. And another is using bribing and blackmail to get converts. The few animists remaining have the worst end of the deal.  The destruction of the ancient and peaceful animistic belief systems of the continent are just a perpetuation of that old disease of racism.   I wish to remark on Manish Gyawali's review from 9 Oct 2004. His review stated quote (1) "Rakshas, the demon, is almost always black" and (2) "every Indian comes to this country <America> expecting to have a run-in with an armed black guy who wants his money":  About (1) Rakshasas had long ago been translated as demons in English, but this is not appropriate as some are good and others bad. They come in a huge range of colours (which have nothing to do with their `good- or badness') incl. green, blue, yellow, purple, grey, black, white. These last 2 refer to the *actual* colours black and white, not any human shades. Rakshasas are *not* humans, but are seen as mythical antagonists to humans, and have magical powers. Indian Gods and other Hindu mythical beings also come in different colours. Eg. Indra is gold, Kali is black and her husband Rudra is white and as Shiva he is violet or ash-grey. Rama and Krishna are different shades of blue, Lakshmi is Pink, Meenakshi is green, etc. Many of these change colours or have different colours in different (versions of) stories. Also, the various Hindu characters and Gods, including Rakshasas, often have non-human numbers of arms, legs, heads and other parts. Some are huge giants and others are animals or mountains etc. in their natural state, but able to take on more human-like forms - with a few excessive limbs. Last time I checked, no human I've seen matched any or all of these criteria. Christian schools in India, like the one I attended for a year, tend to teach selectively. So I've heard the `bad Rakshasa is black' and `good Deva is white' propaganda before. It's their way to divide and convert - sorry, conquer. It doesn't occur to modern man that people from long ago *literally meant* different coloured non-human characters when they wrote/told their interesting myths by the fireside. Is it too hard to conceive that our human ancestors had an imagination and used it to make their tales more interesting and colourful by inventing new creatures? According to the way people nowadays dissect the workings of the minds of ancients, it would seem all the people living millennia back had little intelligence and no creativity I visited a Marae, a set of spiritual community houses of the Maori people of New Zealand. One large wall had paintings that depicted Maori Gods who, like in Hindu mythology, were different coloured (green, black, blue, white, etc.) and giants. This also occurs in religions all over the world. Are we to accuse all of them of racism? Oh, please. My parents, who are teachers, took me to Africa for 2 years to document some of the peoples' original religions and traditions. They later taught what they learnt to the children at the schools back in India. We stayed in a number of animist communities, all of which were very loving and accepting of us. Several of these animist traditions also had Gods that vary greatly in appearance (including Gods in various colours) and fascinatingly interesting myths concerning these. Will conversion-centric religions go and tell their children that their ancestors were racist too? Or maybe that's an honour reserved purely for Indians, because people from different parts of India look superficially different (with external forces hoping to create division based on appearance).   About (2) One can hardly speak for every Indian. The children at the interconnected set of Hindu schools (all over India) that my parents teach at, learn about many indigenous peoples and cultures of the world and are taught to see the unifying commonality in this interesting diversity. These children learn to appreciate differences in appearance and culture, as have their parents and communities who often studied at the same schools. That accounts for over 100,000 non-bigotted Indians over the last few decades who I can speak for.  My cousin went to work in the US. The only thing he was warned about was to check that all the food he bought was beef-free. The only impressions of America that the average Indian can gain comes from the American programming available in India. For instance, US police dramas at times stereotype, often showing African-Americans as using guns or committing crime. But I'd sooner blame the biased foreign programming, where this nonsense originates, than Indian society itself. 
 This book is a good book for older kids playing Tee ball.  I am coaching a YMCA league comprised of 3 and 4 year olds.  If you are coaching little guys/gals - I would recommend videos more than books 
 My name is Big Samad Sefiane, I have been writing screenplays and making music since the age of 13. The only problem with that book which came out in feb. 2004 is very much a like my screenplay I have written and copyrighted before he released his book. I wouldn't rate a book, singer or songwriter who takes other peoples ideas and mixes it with his work. The book is too much similar to my screenplay Entitled HACKERS. After sept. 11, 2000 mail slowed down and it took me a year to copyright my screenplay. The screenplay as visible on the internet and also sent to strattford career institute for editing. The similar scripts will be reviewed by an entertainment attorney 
 Your service was excellant. The movie we ordered for a relative who could not find it. Why ; I have no idea as I did not care for the movie when it was new. We will be ordering other items from you in the future and are very satisfied with your availabilty of movies etc 
 I was hoping to learn things I hadn't seen in other books, but I didn't.  Not only is the book outdated, but it's also quite limited in what it offers.  I was not happy with it at all 
 Shocked to find this book in a middle school.  Barely a page goes by without FOUL language.  If this were a talented author, there would be no need for the EXCESSIVE language. It seems to give license to the idea that it's OK for kids to use this kind of language - what a shame 
 This story was about a young brother trying to make it in life. I have to admit that I was excited to read this book, and it let me down.  I didn't like how Bobby let Pearl walk all over him.  I don't think Bobby Dallas was portrayed as a "Do Right Man" at all, but rather a wimp.  During the first half of the book, I waited for him to get a back bone, which he never did.  From there on the whole story was slow. I was bored about continually reading about him and his radio job.   This was a slow read for me, I skipped a few chapters just so I could find out what finally happened in the end 
 This book is more about feel good stories of people who started a business and they liked what they were doing.  If you liked Chicken Soup for the Soul, you will probably like this.  I was looking for a book to give some  ideas of what good businesses someone could do part-time and make some  extra money.  These stories covered various set up costs and barely gave an  idea of what is needed.  The book basically sums up to be: Find out what  you like and make a plan.  If you already figured that out, don't buy the  book 
 First off, let me say that I have read just about all of the Dragonlance novels.  Frightening thought, I know.  While I am not of the belief that the first three are gospel, I come to expect a bit more from a book.  In every trilogy by Weis (as well as Hickman in most) there are events and cliffhangers that keep you going.  Dragons sacking a city that everyone is in.  A building falling on someone.  Finding out the "true" name of the One God in the Souls trilogy.  There was usually something to keep you going.  Be it a question that was left unanswered or the state of a character that you have come to love.    This book has none of that.  In other trilogies, there are actually 3 minor stories that are built into a larger one.  Each book is its own work.  This book is built on one simple idea, what if Mina fell for yet another god.  She is one of a mere handfull of characters that appears in the novel, and remains as shallow and dimwitted as ever.    Rhys, the other main character, is really the only interesting thing this book has to offer.  Yet, he shows no action to speak of.  You get about a hundred pages of him wandering around looking for someone. Essentially, to wrap up what is turning into a long and (sorry) obnoxious review, nothing happens.  Pick it up a library sometime if you are interested, I am sure it will keep until the rest of this tale is generated 
 This book was recommended for me by Amazon and I am glad I took it out from the library instead of buying it. It took me a long time to get through the book and I found that I forced myself to finish reading it. The main character is hard to relate to or even sympathize with. And at the end of the book I feel that nothing has been resolved. I would not recommend this book. 
 I bought a sight from Airsplat for my son's airsoft rifle as a Christmas gift. The screws were too short to attach it to his airsoft rifle's weaver rail. Yes, I could go out and find screws the proper length, but I though I'd make Airsplat do their job.   So, after several e-mails with the service department, they shipped screws that they claimed were the right size. Wrong. The diameter of the new screws is so big they won't fit through the mounting bracket on the sight. Obviously it was too hard to try this out in the store to see if it would really mount on a weaver rail before selling the product or when they sent replacement screws.   Why by a gun from these guys?  If it arrives broken, you pay to ship it back.  Want a refund?  You pay a 15% restocking fee.  Take a pass on Airsplat. 
 One of my goals this year is to decide whether biology provides a good argument for God -- in particular, to evaluate the claims of the Intelligent Design movement.  I just read Robert Pennock's Tower of Babel, which purports to give evidence against ID, but doesn't, really.  Pennock offers arguments from analogy of doubtful relevance, and trash-talks his opponents, Johnson in particular, with a sophistication that seems primarily rhetorical.  In one sense, this volume turns out to be a good book to read next, since Johnson replies to some of Pennock's arguments.  (He easily refutes Pennock's argument from linguistic evolution, and pokes a hole or two in his computer analogy as well.)  But all in all, the book further confirmed my growing skepticism about Johnson's role in the debate.    First of all, I am weary of all the trash-talking on both sides.  Shut up and argue, already!  Show your opponents the respect they deserve -- all these men are intelligent, informed, and in some regards at least informative.  Give facts and evidence, showing by the balance of your presentation that you care about truth above all.  (A good model of how such a debate might look is Rana and Ross' Origins of Life: Biblical and Evolutionary Models Face Off.)  Like Pennock, Johnson too often hits below the belt.  Neither so much argues the other side wrong, as assume their error, then explains the deviant psychology that led into such sins of the intellect.  (Along with Pennock, Johnson's main targets are Dawkins, Gould, Kenneth Miller, Daniel Dennett, and an unknown scholar of yesteryear named Philip Wentworth.)  Johnson is not attacking a straw man: he does get in some good licks on his targets.  But it often has the feel of an angry game of rhetorical ping-pong, rather than an earnest search for the truth.       It seems to me that some on both sides believe their theories because they honestly think the evidence favors them.  And others, like myself, want to know which the evidence does favor.  To such folks, this book is likely to prove extremely frustrating.     Wedge of Truth also seems to confirm Pennock's observation that Johnson is influenced by a post-modern view of truth.  This may be why, rather than showing why his view is true, he dishes up psycho-political explanations of why the evolutionary  "establishment" has such warped thinking on the subject.  It may also be why he is so coy about what ID is not, playing footsie with Young Earth folks, etc, with whom he probably does not really agree.  No doubt there is some truth in post-modernism, and that truth is embodied in Christian skepticism about the human heart.  But the Gospel teaches us to be skeptical of our own hearts, too.  The two forms of apriori skepticism cancel one other out, and we come back to the neglected problem of evidence.    I have written three books arguing for the truth of Christianity, including from the occurance of miracles and from the life of Jesus, so I am not one of those Christian scholars Johnson rebukes for caving in to methodological materialism.  And as another cantankerous Dr. Johnson put it, "the greatest part of our knowledge is implicit faith." But if this Johnson wants a scientific revolution, he needs to explain exactly what he thinks happened, make an explicit and detailed case for it, and refute (with some generosity of spirit, if possible) arguments for evolution, such as those given by Mayr in What Evolution Is, rather than merely taking pot shots at the most fallacious reasoning on the other side.    author, Jesus and the Religions of Ma 
 This book has beautiful photos of very lovely Japanese-style homes, but I wouldn't say that it's full of ideas for how to find more space in your home, or how to easily incorporate Japanese design or features into your already existing home. I would say if you have a lot of money, a lot of space, and at least some land, you could use this book to rebuild and create the perfect Japanese home. And you're going to have to get rid of all (and I mean all) the tchatchkes, or else cram them all in your new storage space. Which is not a bad idea for us Americans (getting rid of them, that is). I would like to see a book with ideas on how to use Japanese interior design ideas to help create more space and beauty in any home, using the Japanese aesthetic of wabi-sabi 
  I ordered this Dress on March 6th. I recevied an email from the company saying that it would ship by March 8th. On March 16th, I receive an email saying that they are out the size I wanted and my order has been canceled. This is unacceptable from a business. I should have been notified by March 9th that the dress had not been shipped. I have less than 24 hours to find a replacement dress. Thanks alot 
 I devoured Barry Singer's "Ever After" in one sitting, and mainly because I was so pumped up by anger that I couldn't put it down.  Why on earth would an author write an entire book about a subject for whiche he has such clear hatred?  From what I could count, he liked less than five musicals between 1978 and 2004, and thinks that there are less than five people who can "save" musical theater.  Whether or not it needs saving is up to the reader, but he knocks the genre flat every chance he can get.  He seems to abhor the "standard" of what a musical is, pushing for anything that is remotely boundary-pushing, good or bad.  If you cannot appreciate the standard, how do you really know what is pushing the boundaries?  In "Ever After," the author makes it clear that either his poison pen or his utter disregard and malevolence toward an entire genre has written this book (without the benefit of an editor or fact checker no less), rather than a feeling human being who can see and hear when inside a theater.  Harsh?  Absolutely, but the book is written in such sweeping over-reaching tones, that's the only way to read it.  
 I think if you've lived life under a rock, watched a lot of soap operas, and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas, this book will appeal to you.    It makes me angry to read this book; not because it's fiction (and I'll call it completely fictitious garbage), but because James Frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction!  He writes this book with an underlying tone "I'm better than all of you."  Not because he thinks AA is BS, but because this theme runs throughout his book, in so many situations, that after awhile it becomes laughable!  He prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain a-hole, except his tough guy "friends."  I ask you, if Leonard has such a reputation... where's his protection?  People would be after him in such a vulnerable (read: no security) place like rehab.     I think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its BS by feeling its predictability.  It reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people, yeah, he's got problems, but he'll prevail because he's James Frey!  No thank you.  I absolutely hated this book, but I read it so I at least deserve credit for trying. 
 I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film.  But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor.  Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes.  And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever.  I was sorely disappointed!  If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson.  And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell.  Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days.  Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times.  This film just doesn't cut it 
 "The Glorious Cause" is the sequel to "Rise to Rebellion," and since the first novel was so good I eagerly dove into this one, but was disappointed to find it had nowhere near the same depth and quality of characterization. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 4, as compared to the 8 I would give "Rise to Rebellion."  The events recounted in "Rise to Rebellion" involving the lead up to the Revolutionary War seemed so much more detailed and interesting, with a vast array of characters that were so colorful; John Adams, Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, Ben Franklin, and others. "The Glorious Cause" was not without its merits, but it seemed so much drier and less appealing, with a more narrow focus. It was far too long in some parts, to the point my attention wandered, and getting through it was a chore in some sections, unlike the preceding novel which seemed to turn its own pages. I listened to this book on audio tape during my commute, and often found myself impatiently trying to keep my focus upon the narrative while controlling my urge to fast forward to a livelier scene.  One element I felt truly slighted by was the coverage of Benedict Arnold and his defection to the British cause. I assumed this would be one of the lengthier and more rewarding sections of the book, but it zipped by fairly rapidly with little genuine immersion into the subject material.  A mark of a good book is how I feel when I have finished reading it - if I am disappointed I have reached the end of the story, then I know it was time well spent. Getting to the end of "The Glorious Cause" felt more like finishing some particularly grueling outdoor project; it was uncomfortable work, and now that I'm done I feel I can do something a bit more interesting. Because Shaara did such a good job with "Rise to Rebellion" I don't feel my lack of appeal for this book is his responsibility; perhaps the subject matter didn't complement my taste as well. I prefer interesting historial detail over tepid, droning battle descriptions, and I feel the differences between those two categories represent perfectly the differences between "Rise to Rebellion" and "The Glorious Cause. 
 After reading Emlyn Williams' book about the Moor Murders, I was hoping to get a better understanding from Ian Brady, the convicted murderer himself. I discovered that reading this book that I had mixed reaction. First, he would have made a great writer just like Ted Bundy would have been a great lawyer or politician if they hadn't murdered innocent people mostly women and children which is a sad reminder of what might had been for so many people, the families and friends of the victims themselves and the families of Bundy and Brady. It is a shame but Brady does offer insight into the man who views other serial killers like Bundy, Gacy, the Green River Killer (before he was known to everybody), the Kingsbury Run Murderer, Jack the Ripper, etc. Brady gives a pretty good idea of what he sees in the criminals with the same arrogance that Bundy once did trying to find the Green River Killer for the Seattle cops. Anyway, BRady will remain in prison for the rest of his life. His partner Myra Hindley died after this book was published in prison as well. Nothing excuses Brady's crimes, the Moors Murders were some of the most vicious crimes in British history. Anyway, the book is interesting to read and reread again because Brady's writing isn't always clear. He is better than most new writers or inexperienced ones. BRady clearly could have had a writing career rather than be written about for his crimes against humanity. It's a shame and a pity that Brady and HIndley did horrendous things to children and Edward Evans. Even as I was reading this, I was following the JonBenet Ramsey case with John Mark Karr and the coverage he got. 
 I was very excited to buy this book because of Paul Chek's reputation as a top fitness expert. I also own his book "How to eat, move, and be healthy" which I have enjoyed. However,  This book is extremely disappointing. First of all, it is only 54 pages long, very short for the 24.95 price. It is less than 1/2 inch thick.  Next, the book launches into highly complex language regarding concepts ranging from balance and reactions to open and closed chain exercises. Some of it can be understood, but most of it is so overly analytical it is hard to know how to apply it.   I was hoping this book would give me some clear information on how to improve my fitness routines and new concepts on how to exercise. However, it offers little or no diagrams of new exercises and only goes on and on with different scientific terms that are tough to memorize and tough to translate into your excercise program.   I am planning on returning this book to Amazon due to the reasons stated above. Do not waste your money on this book 
 I was actually thinking about buying this book; until I saw the authors childish and very rude remarks to customers that have bought his book and replyed to it. Do not support this A hole!! Look for someone else. This man does not deserve your hard earned money!. See for youeselfs. skepdic.com 
 Another reviewer mentioned the blurb on the back of this book, and that it didn't accurately reflect the real story.  I thought this book was going to be some kind of "monster in the closet" thriller.  Instead it turned out to be an testosterone-driven, urban-cave-exploring, Rambo-lovin', bore. So, I'm still trying to figure out why they threw in the five-legged cat?!?! 
 The Scifi Channel isn't known for giving us great movies, but they usually do better than this incohesive mess.  Set in the dark ages or somewhere around there, we're introduced to a village that must sacrifice eight youths to the vicious Minotaur on the isle of Minos.  The chieftain (a cameo by Rutger Hauer) is allowed to keep his young son (Tom Hardy) from being chosen because he is next in line for the kingdom, but when son's fiancee is whisked away for sacrifice and he is told by a leper woman (Ingrid Pitt) that she is alive, son decides to sneak in and kill the dreaded beast.  Once taken to Minos, Candyman himself (Tony Todd) appears, snorting gas from some kind of seashell and acting like some kind of god himself.  Needless to say, all of the son's friends and he are dropped in for food for the minotaur and most of the movie is spent with the characters trying to elude the monster, but not smart enough to stop yapping or screaming to avoid it. The Minotaur effects are substandard and the whole thing just doesn't gel.  Nice try folks but really just a lot of bull 
 I'm so sick of Rapist Kelly. First he records himself raping a 14 year old girl and every one of his songs is about sex. All of his songs have clues that makes him pratically tell on hismself on just how much he likes 14 year old girls. It can be in his lyrics. Sometimes, the song titles say it all. 1. "Your Body's Callin'" lyric : "your body's callin me" Yeah and that 14 year old Mommy's calling her. 2. "Bump N' Grind" lyric : "I don't see nothing wrong witta liitle Bump N' Grind" I saw the tape. I BET YOU DON'T. 3. "Homie Lover Friend" LYRIC : "Homieee lover friend is what I'm looking for, Some one who can relate to what I have in store" what you have in store can cost you a prision sentence 4. "It Seems Like You're Ready" : I doubt it. She was 14. You Probably forced her 5. "Freak Dat Body" Freak a body that can legally buy cigarrates. 6. "I Like The Crotch On You" BET YOU DID 7. "summer bunnies" Lyric : "It's summertime so it's time to get a summer bunny" Again, get one that can legally buy cigarattes 8. "For You" lyric : "You need a man who's (honest) and (understanding)" I bet his wife wasn't understand when she saw that tape. I bet he was dishonest and deined it to his wife too. I hope she turned him in 9. "Back To The Hood Of Things" are those 'things' 14 year old girls? 10. "Sadie" is that the 14 old girl's name? 11. "Sex me 1 and 2" he'll get sexed alot when they lock his A$$ UP. 12. "12 Inch Play" Is her refering to a vinyl record or the legnth of his magic stick? It's hard to tell because it saw so far inside that 14 year old girl I'm suprised he was able to take it out See, this is what disgusts me about Rapist Kelly. In every one of his songs, he either tells on himself, has a sexual reference, or has clues in them. All of his songs have double meaning to them now. Even songs that he writes for other musicians have clues in them : Examples : Aaliyah (RIP) "Age ain't nothin but a number" That is exactly what Rapist kelly was thinking when he was doin that 14 year old girl. He wrote Toni Braxton's "I don't want to". He's going to be saying that when some guy tries to rape him in jail and they probably won't take no for an answer. He also wrote Syleena Johnson's "I am your woman". Once he's raped in jail, he's going to be going around singing "I am your woman". Rapist kelly disgusts m 
 Yeah im pretty sure this book is great but I haven't got around to reading it yet... I think im going to start tomorrow... ah nah thats too soon 
 This movie is ridiculously inaccurate. Noah and his family get attacked by water pirates led by Lot who by the way wasn't alive till about 1000 years AFTER the flood. There's a water peddler as well-NOT IN THE BIBLE. Sodom and Gamorrah are destroyed which also doesn't happen for another 1000 years to which Lot has a big part. This "Lot" is a huge sinner, his wife is horrible and he has no daughters. God is portrayed as whimsical. Noah's son's aren't very godly either. It's inaccuracies and toying with the bible makes it worthy of kindling to start a fire. Don't bother watching it if you know the bible and love the Lord you will end up being disgusted too. Hollywood will do anything to ruin biblical movies. Stick to The Ten commandments, The Passion of the Christ, this one isn't worth 10 cents.. 
 The book begins with Huffington complaining that her cable bill has just gone up while the CEO of her cable company just got a fat raise. Poor Huffington, the victim of ruthless greedy CEO's. Here's  an idea Arianna, dump cable and sign up with dish network or Voom or DirectTV, or just cancel service altogether, its just cable TV not oxygen. She really doesn't discuss the fact that there are such alternatives. Why are there so many alternatives to those meanies at the cable company? Because of deregulation which she bemoans as the source of all the worlds troubles in the first place. This sort of nutty reasoning is used throughout the entire book. If youre an angry lefty by all means buy this book. If you want to learn somthing, don't waste your money 
 Imagine a society where women are in charge and men are trained to serve. That is the premise of this book but it does not deliver in the way of sexual female domination. There are some scenes where the main male character is disciplined by the 'women in charge' but most of the book is about his sexual power over women and how women can't resist him. That is not FemDom.  The book also targets Christianity with many references to a female Savior and a female religious structure similar to the Catholic church. This may offend some people.   I read the entire book and enjoyed it in spots. It is a sexual novel with a little FemDom but if FemDom is what you seek, this book will probably disappoint.  
 This recording has a lot to answer for, having spawned literally a thousand similar relaxation records. I bought it enthusiastically in the mid-seventies. How has it aged? Not very well, I`m afraid, the passing  years revealing all too well its lack of musical substance. I will not deny  that it may relax children and musically uneducated adults. But I cannot  stomach his pretense that this Western diatonic scale rambling is being  linked to the actual activity of the chakra system. This is the stuff  confusion is made of, and Halpern would deserve more than two stars if he  simply stuck with his ability to compose harmless relaxation pieces, not  calling it music with actual ability to heal 
 Boring on disc...not a true musical theatre score at all!  Not Disney's best effort, but it will be a cash cow. Visually interesting on stage, but not enough to make for the extra-slim story line.  Kids will love it 
 No Spoilers  Where to start. This could easily turn into a long review, but I don't want it to be so I'll try to keep it short. Also, I'll stay away from the religious views regarding this book and focus on the writing because religion is subjective and everyone can (and should) think whatever they want about their religion) Having said that, the one recurring thought I had about this book while reading it (and while thinking about it after completing it for this review) was that it is without a doubt the most esoteric and pedantic book I have ever read.   Now I'm not stupid, and I can appreciate the beauty of words and the importance of diction, but so much of this book was Rushdie writing in such a way to make sure that you had no idea what the hell he was talking about. There are times when you can be extremely metaphorical and lofty and times when you should just be blunt, but for Rushdie, there is no bluntness, and everything must be doused in the most stringy and free-formed words he can think of. Why? In some cases it adds to the story... in this, it doesn't. While there are some very good parts in this book, they are all surrounded by a lot of words that don't really say anything.  Bottom line: you can skip this book. However, those interested in religion and questioning said relgion will probably read it anyway. I would suggest you get a durable copy because you will want to throw it against the wall a few times.  PS: The best part of the whole book for me was towards the end in the scenes between Saladin and his father. If the whole book had been written like that, it would've been a pleasure 
 This is the first in the Shopaholic series. Rebecca Bloomwood has a very serious problem. She can't stop shopping. She has crazy money issues, and literally just hides her bills in a drawer and goes and shops more to make herself feel better. This novel takes place in Britain, where Bex (her nickname) spends all of her money earned as a financial journalist on the latest designer clothes. PS she knows nothing about finance, which adds humor as she bumbles her way through the work day in order to attend another press meeting that serves free champagne. The irony of her job and compulsion are cute, and Bex really means well, but honestly, can't you just cut up the credit card? How hard is it to not buy more sweaters? I'd only recommend this book if you're a big shopper, because that's the fun part. Otherwise, it's hard to like Rebecca because she comes across as irresponsible, endlessly without any willpower, and materialistic as they come. That said, I still must confess that I also read Shopaholic Ties the Knot and Shopaholic & Sister 
 I was going to buy this book, but when I looked at the inside and how it was written, I decided not to. My God, this writer can't spell - the grammar is horrible, and that was just on the first few pages. So I've decided not to buy it. Get Lethal Intent instead. Also about Aileen and very well written 
 I have an old 80s VHS of this from a budget label that cost me $4 back in the day.  And it still looks better.  Heads get cut off, scratches galore.  And it sounded better--Madacy should've added subtitles to "The Pharmacist."  Many of the shorts can't even track the audio; people talk a beat before their mouths move. I didn't get my money's worth, and I paid $6 
 While the product works it's good.  It was capabable of trimming eyebrows, sideburns, beards & mustaches, and that pesty stray nosehair.  The problem with the MicroTouch is that the motor works for about 6 months and then it is useless.  It is not worth the money. Buy a product that costs more money and is better quality. 
 If only there were less stars to give.    This is one of the worst solutions manuals I've ever owned - problems are selected for solution in no discernable pattern (eg: problems 1,2 and 5b are worked in sec6.1) many solutions are only partially completed, and crucial steps have been skipped in many of the problems that /have/ been worked.  It would be more appropriate for Wiley to have marketed this as a 'Student Hints Manual' or perhaps 'Student Badly-Type-Set-Partially-Worked-Randomly-Selected Solutions Manual'.   
 I discarded the DVD after watching it. If you do not want to have the impression of witchcraft in your home don't buy this version of The Secret Garden. 
 But I am a big fan of the music.  While I get the fact that Sally Bowles is supposed to be second-rate and I'm all for doing Cabaret as realistically as possible, I still find it extremely difficult to listen to Natasha's Richardson's singing.  I just can't figure out why one would voluntarily subject oneself to something so terrible and painful to listen to.  The patrons of the "real" Kit Kat Club were obviously really drunk and depressed while listening to Sally Bowles, but I'm not prepared to get wasted every time I want to listen to the music of Cabaret.  I don't doubt that Natasha Richardson was great in the role, but maybe it was necessary to see her in the the show to derive pleasure from her songs here.    Everyone else is fine.  
 Our family loves all types of memory games, and this is the most attractive.  The colorful stripes on the back are great, the pictures are good, the click of the squares on the tabletop are satisfying, and the fact that they are true squares means that they fit easily and perfectly into the box.  My only negative comment is that there is no indication  which country each child represents.  The children who play this game are capable of learning country and costume together...I think it is an obvious teaching opportunity. In fact, I would like to know this myself 
 I think that this book is a forgery by appenine fascist youth.   Like most of this book's readers, they took their master plan far too seriously.  It's this inability to laugh which makes the work canonical, but nonetheless a product of unknown authorship 
 This movie was released in 1969 which makes it thirty six (36yrs) years to this date, and there is still not an ENGLISH version. I was so "pi...pi...pi...pi...piss-off" when I popped in this DVD and .......... Movies are meant to be WATCHED not READ. Otherwise, this movie seems promising.  And Amazon, can you PLEASE put an alert on DVDs that are not in ENGLISH....especially foreign films. This would be a BIG help 
    The New York State Consumer Protection Board didn't issue a scathing 25 page document on Lesko for nothing.     Much of the "free" money is stuff like food stamps, low income housing assistance, Medicare, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.    There are plenty of serious publications out there that will list money available for scholarships, business loans and other serious enterprises.      Readers looking for information on "big discounts" for government cars will find out about auctions of vehicles confiscated from drug dealers and tax cheats. "Free car repairs" turn out to be government mandated auto recalls. "10% off your restaurant bill" is going to early bird special at a local eatery.      If these books aren't fraud, they are damn close.      Cavaet Emptor.  
 Try "Sam and the Lucky Money" for a good story and an accurate portrayal of life in SF Chinatown 
 It was mostly about her family and they are not that interesting 
 If you have nothing to read it may be okay.But otherwise no.All they do is orginize a yard sale.There is no plot.It is a waste of time 
 I will never ever recommend this author. She may claim to be a Christian, but her behavior is anything but. This person has no business counseling parents of homosexuals, as it is clear she has no understanding of them. She describes them as something that formed wrong, flowers that didn't open. I have news for you, Ms. Johnson. God doesn't make mistakes. Each person is made that way for a reason, just because you can't get out of a stone age interpretation of the Bible, don't infect other parents and friends of gay people with your poisonous fake christian "love". I want to go wash my hands in lysol. It is because of attitudes like hers that Christians like me are portrayed as a bunch of whacko nutjobs 
 I can't think about any other explanation for this silly, stupid thriller if you want to call it that. I can't believe that the writer is doing so badly. I am most certainly disappointed with this book. In the last couple of years, I think he had lost his steam. Plus, why does he have to come up with 15 books or so a year? Why does he not read his own book before he sends it to the publisher? It's time for me to move on to another writer....  I would advice readers to not to read this book 
 From the moment I picked up a copy of GUILTY PLEASURES and started reading it, I was hooked on Anita Blake and pretty much devoured the succeeding books. Anita became like a friend and I simply had to know what the author had in store for her, hence I used to pick up the next book as soon as I get to the last page of the previous one. Sadly, this series also proves that all good things must come to an end as we see in the decline of the quality of Hamilton's writing after OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY.   When I write reviews, I do like to summarize the plot. However after reading INCUBUS DREAMS, I was stuck trying to figure out how to begin my review. The problem is that this book has no plot, even though the back cover may suggest otherwise. This is so far the lengthiest book in the series, but there was hardly any of the kick-as* action that I have come to love in the other books, especially the first few. Ask me what I liked about the other books and I can go on about it. Ask me what INCUBUS DREAMS is about and all I can remember is that Anita spent more time feeding the ardeur, which meant getting down and dirty with any man that was available several times a day, whether in private or in front of her numerous male friends. I am certainly no prude but the sex scenes in this book were simply gratuitous and boring. Anita has spent more time on her back and knees than killing those monsters. I miss the old Anita whose sarcasm and no-nonsense attitude I found entertaining and actually endearing. Will someone please tell Ms Hamilton to bring her back?  I will not ramble on much further, but I can tell you now that MICAH is actually worse than this one. I still have DANSE MACABRE to go, but I am leaving that for much much later since I am not sure I can handle any more of Anita's sexual antics at the moment 
 The Salem Witch trials, possibly one of the most analyzed and anomolous events in American history, are documented with basic accuracy in Hoffer's book. However, in an attempt to say something new about such an overdone  subject, Hoffer fills his book with references to supposed neo-witch trials  (the satanic craze surrounding heavy metal in the 1980's), makes references  to popular culture, and even pulls in the godawful, ridiculous wheat ergot  theory.       In addition, the cover is absolutlely eye-hurting horrid. If  you are forced to write a paper on this book, as I was, and must look at it  for several weeks, I would sugggest a very good pair of sunglasses 
 I have been using this now for 4 weeks.  I have seen no difference now then when I started and it stings like the devil when I use it!  It makes my eyes burn terribly.  I'm glad to see it has worked for some but it hasn't done anything for my dark circles 
 This is proof positive that the  vast right-wing conspiracy is alive and well today!  Tyrrell vomits his vitriolic, vituperative diatribe. over 235 pages of utter hate for a man whose derriere he doesn't deserve to be a pimple upon!   
 First let me say that aside from any of the ideas presented, this book deserves a low rating just because of how horribly it is written.  Skinner has no real style and simply rattles of declarative sentences at such a monotonous pace that I was practically tearing my hair out at the end of the book.  And for all the mechanistic nature of his writing, he's suprisingly inept at conveying a point.  But getting to the ideas contained therein.  This book combines the very shaky "science" of behaviorism with the silliest doomsday rhetoric that was so typical of the decades following the invention of the atomic bomb.  Skinner starts off by talking about how horrible the human race has thus far managed itself, how we are in danger at any second of annihilating ourselves.  This kind of alarmism was probably very convincing in the 70s, but it hardly has any force with reasonable people today, who realize that, despite our flaws, we seem to be pretty good at surviving.  Skinner then goes into the meat of his book, which is pretty much summed up by saying, "There is no circumstance under which humans are not controlled.  It's just a matter of the form the control takes, and there's no such thing as an autonomous agent inside us.  We need to accept that and engineer the perfect society by devising ways of control that are better."  If you read those three sentences, you don't really need to read "Beyond Freedom & Dignity," but for those who are curious, I'll say a few more words, mainly criticism.  The first criticism is that, of course, Skinner just constantly and tediously repeats that it is an established scientific "fact" it is that we are purely products of the environment (whether personally or through evolution) without justifying it very well.  Paradoxically, he admits that the science of human behavior is poorly developed compared to, say, biology and physics, and in fact hasn't progressed much since Aristotle. He is oblivious to this contradiction.  On the one hand, he wants it to be certain and unquestioned that a human can be completely explained by his science.  On the other, his science is underdeveloped (because people have not accepted that it is true yet).  He seems to think that behaviorist science does not need any sophistication or development in order for it's most weighty premise--that humans have no autonomy--to be an accepted fact.  Skinner puts the cart before the horse.  The second criticism is that Skinner never really gets down to any even slightly useful details on what his Utopia will look like.  His excuse is, again, that behaviorist science is still not developed enough, I guess.  But it seems like someone who says, "We must change our culture so that it has the best possible effect on our lives" isn't really saying anything profound.  In other words, his dramatic plan for the human race reduces to nothing more than saying, "Let's do things better."  In a book of 200 pages, Skinner really doesn't give much information at all.  It's worth mentioning that after every chapter he gives a short one-paragraph summary of the ideas in that chapter.  He could have simply published those summaries and retained about 90% of the real content of his book.  Thirdly, Skinner is oblivious to the inherent contradictions in his position.  If man is just a product of his environment, with no real autonomy, no inherent ability to act in and of himself, then how can we even "plan" anything for the future?  If a superior culture does develop, it cannot be considered anything but a happy accident.  It can't even be considered "happy," since that term implies some inner agent who is happy.  I guess we would just say, "It would be favorable for the participants."  There is something just simply idiotic in saying, "We should design a better culture, because none of us have free will and are just products of our culture."  I suppose Skinner only wrote his book due to the stimulus of his environment and thus can't be blamed for the inconsistency... But the point I'm making is that in order to act for positive change, you have to feel like you have some autonomous capacity to change things.  All in all, the book is rather dated.  The idea of man as simply a machine that converts stimulus to response, with emotions and thoughts (if they exist at all) as mere side effects is absurd to anyone who does a little introspection instead of, say, studying figures on how incomes and education relate to robbery convictions.  And the doomsday scenarios that motivate the work are much less compelling (to reasonable people, at least) than they used to be.  I don't recommend this book unless you have some scholarly need to read it.  On final reflection, it appears to me as simply an attempt by Skinner to profit off the anxieties of his times rather than an earnest attempt at offering useful knowledge to mankind 
 A bit disappointing...  I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best.  After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read.  Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books.  Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized "almost", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily.  The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels. Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her.  Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected. Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on.  This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)  
 Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade "Miss Congeniality" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies 
 Not to sound trite, but this book was written by Dummies.... the examples are not true to life, there are too many mistakes and the explaination of JavaScript is too complicated and overblown 
 This book does not have the quality that I am use to reading in her books.  If you want to read a really good one, read "The Harvestor" or "Freckles.&quot 
   I "enjoyed" viewing this film and seeing "the good guy" win. But, "there must be a better way" to resolve conflicts, "a better way" to punish bad guys,  "a better way to deal with evil" than just go out and kill everyone involved!  We live in a violent world with terrorists and suicide murderers and car bombings and killing our troops in Iraq and The Sunnis killing the Shiites and vice versa, etc..etc.   I always believe there MUST be "a better way" besides everyone killing the other guys.  So, that's what I have against this film.  As for the film itself, I enjoyed the musical theme and the acting of Clint Eastwood and the acting of all the other members of the cast. It is a "good film" except for the violence.   And, yes, "the good guy" does win in the end---I'm happy about that!  And, I enjoyed the photography also.  So, yes, definitely SEE the film but as you do, could you possibly think of "a better way" for resovling issues rather than the violence depicted in this film?  Email:boland7214@aol 
 The book is about 50% actual negotiating tactics and 50% political commentary.  There were some interesting ideas insofar as negotiating strategies, but nothing really unique.  The author comes across as a combination of an friendly, lovable uncle and the Jack Lemmon character in Glengarry Glen Ross.  His political commentaries showed a breathtaking shallowness and lack of historical knowledge...such as his statement that the Western world's confrontation with the Islamic world began in 1979(?!).  In the appendices, Cohen includes several memorandums to top officials in various administrations which provide insight to a neo-con understanding of the world. That such an underdeveloped grasp of geopolitics occupies a large portion of the book throughout is disappointing, and seems to influence Mr. Cohen's thoughts on negotiating.  
 I still have not recieved the item ordered on 2/28 and today is 3/31. I will be waiting and not placing any more orders from there!!!!!!!!! 
 I was kind of disappointed with the Black& Decker Power Mop, it is to bottom heavey to flip the scrubbing brush easily. You have to use two hands to flip the brush down and two hands to push the brush away.  I have already told friends "don't bother to spend $49 for this mop, it isn't worth the money.  Get a women to design this product.  I can't believe a women would have found this easy to use. 
 I don't know why people are attracted to Bell's playing. I think part of it is due to his public image as the young sexy violinist that all the girls like....  Stay away from this recording! Honestly, the Mendelssohn is overly sentimental, and the Beethoven was not serious as all! I preferred the way Menuhin played it, with grace and style and elegance. Sorry, I hate it when people like Bell butcher up two most famous violin pieces. Get the Menuhin/Furtwangler recording. Even the audio is bad, Menuhin's interpretations are SUPREME!  I'm done now 
 Oh did this one stink.  Convoluted and confusing, the buildup to the conclusion was positively endless.  I didn't laugh once 
 If you're a fan of Chappelle's humor...DON'T BOTHER.  Yes, he paid for it, but he's abusing his reputation with this one to the point of fraud.  No standup & a few rehashed liners from the show he bailed on.  If you're a fan of hip hop & soul, just buy the CDs of the artists!  No full sets and obnoxious cuts into pointless commentary.  If you're looking to be haughty as a fan of 'whatever that documentary from '73' was called, that's cool.  If you're waiting to actually be entertained, this disc is busted.  I love soul, but this fails to satisfy 
 The other reviews are correct in that you have to read this book with an open mind.  It appears all the reviews for this book were written by followers and friends of Tookie.  Like I said, you have to really keep an open mind when reading it, knowing that it was written by a murderer who claims redemption but doesn't admit to his crime.  Even the things he does admit, and profit from, lilke forming the Crips, he never fully achieves redemption.  If so, then he would have cooperated with law enforcement to help dismantle the very gangs he preaches to children about not joining.  He has not even so much as given up any other gang-bangers that he witnessed committing crimes.  Its clear to see where his loyalties still lie.  If I had to do it again, I would borrow the book to read so I wouldn't have to spend my money on it 
 This product will not fix your disc, I tried to fix a damaged CD and it only made the problem worse.  I ended up throwing away the CD and the SkipDoctor.  This is a poorly designed and manufactured product that does not work, I wish someone would have told me this before I spent money on it 
 I have just taken a programming theory which used this book. This book has very poor descriptions and basically I had to peice things together from other students. Honestly, if you're going to buy a book for your own personal enrichment this is definetly not the way to go. No answers. Bad Descriptions. akward proofs. nuff sai 
 This is a beautifully restored and digitally remastered copy.  One of the poorest examples of the genius of Rogers and Hammerstein musicals.  Poor screenplay, poor plot, very few hit songs.  If on Broadway today, it would close in the first week if not after the first night.  I resold this DVD 
 This book is most useful if one wishes to study Walter Kaufmann.  This book is a waste of time if you wish to study the writers Kaufmann presents to us.  Kaufmann warps the texts to suit his own agenda.  If you share his agenda you will likely not even notice that he has an agenda.  "If you make people think they are thinking they will love you, but if you really make them think they will kill you. " - Albert Einstein  
 The quality is not consistant with all the other items I have ordered from Amazon.  The pages of the book fall apart easily. Also, the recemmended age group is 9-12 and the book uses profanity.  It is not necessary to use such profanity or any profanity for this age group.  I have returned the item and will be more cautious in the future 
 Presumably the label is trying to cater to mid-range fans who have a Prince album or two but don't want to buy them all and who want more than a single disc hits collection. The way this is laid out though is confusing at best: Disc 1 seems to be for the mid-range fan and it makes sense that they would choose the single edits though some of those chosen are questionable. ("My Name is Prince"? His take on "Nothing Compares 2 U" when Sinead O'Connor's is definitive?) Disc 2 compiles 12" mixes and remixes and similar rarities..i.e. for the diehard only who has to have every little bleat His Purpleness every records.  BOTTOM LINE: This is haphazardly thrown together. Middle range fans are better off with THE HITS/THE B-SIDES which compiles his biggest chart stuff with a pretty decent selection of interesting flip side material (some of which equals his singles) 
 I have Cabin Fever and Thanks for the ether and a few others and i was really upset. This CD kinda...blew. I mean, The songs aren't very creative like the other ones... and what is up with that little girl singing? The playrites werent as good as Cabin FEvers (the Exclusive Celebrity Double Date). The tune and rhythum was okay, but it really wasn't good. The voice is stronger, but the songs are bad. It didn't catch my ear like CAbin Fever did. I would not reccomend this CD to ANYONE who has heard RAsputina before and new fans. It is not one of there best work 
 This book may be as well called "the chicken soup for the writing-it-down souls".  The author illustrates her points by telling many uplifting stories.  However, if you are a self-help reader like me who is used to David Allen's "Getting Things Done", you may find that storytelling is distracting and not as convincing as it can 
 I stumbled across this book by accident at my library and decided what the heck, all those millions reading Gray's franchise can't be wrong.  Plus, I've seen Gray on Larry King once, and he seemed like a nice and reasonable enough guy.  This book, though, promising in its intro to be "sexy", touched more of my comical than my sensual nerves.  Now, I am not above accepting bedroom advice where it's warranted (for instance, it is thanks to Dr. Gray that I finally made sense of that night years ago when my husband slept on the couch after a huge fight caused by my criticizing a movie we'd just went to see).  But Gray's generalizations, dumbing down of most issues and sharing his own sex life with his wife Bonnie were mostly unhelpful, and I suspect that the passages I found funny were involuntarily so.   Although I'm the first to admit that women love compliments, Gray's suggestions, as displayed in several top 10-lists of things to say (and, occasionally, what not to say) were a tidbit too repetitive (ever wonder how many combinations you can play with the phrase "your breasts are wonderful"?  Read the book!).  Almost as enlightening was the hot tip on how, while getting to the undressing part, the man should pull the woman's panties "up her crack" (a.k.a. give her a plain old wedgie--no joke).  And, don't miss the one where the Mongolian woman pulls a flag at full mast when she's in the mood and at half when she's not (or maybe it was different colors, I couldn't read clearly through my tears--no offense to the Mongolian people!).  More annoying were the recurring (and very stereotypical) assumptions that a woman always needs 10 or more times more cajoling into sex than a man (in various ways, be it foreplay, flowers or the favored seduction line hit lists), that a man always comes (and too quickly, of course), and that you need constantly innovative acrobatics in the bedroom, or your (otherwise mutually comfortable and sure-fire, I wonder?) approach will become a "turn-off".  Bottom line (no pun intended):  if you want some light and basic (!) guidance, the book is not too terrible, but if it is "advanced bedroom skills" (Gray said that!) that you're after, you're better off digging out that old Erica Jong or even any pulp.        
 NANOPARTICLES???? I was in the process of re-ordering this item until I read the description.  Apparently you're using the public to ascertan whether or not these nanoparticles are safe.  Thanks a lot, Lancome!  Not on MY face!    
 After reading the trilogy, I was left wondering what the hell happened? I have just read all 3 of the His Dark Materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker.    Pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories I've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. There isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. If you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. From first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just MIA for the entire book. Spoilers ahead.   What about Lyra and her parents? Somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? She never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. And Will just goes back with Mary Malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. Over a cup of tea, naturally. And that's it for him. In addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. None of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, Will and Lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . .  all in the last 30 pages. What happened to the story, for cripes sake?!  And what happened to the `temptation'? Was choosing not to stay with Will her way of not succumbing to it? The whole premise is just so lame to start out with. As an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give Lyra and Will a chance to know each other. The flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. Supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together!   Pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. In addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. All of Will and Lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons.   After having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. Iorek Byrnison, Lee Scoresby - instead we get page after page about Mary Malone the Disaffected former Nun. Pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in Him or anything for that matter!   This is NOT children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. It's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. All of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one.   We never get closure on Lyra's parents. We never really understand what Dust is and where it comes from. We never see Will reunited with his mother. We get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how. Lyra and Will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it. The mulefa and Mary Malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. Presumably, Will goes home, although we never see it. All that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing. The major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about Armageddon? What happened to the Fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. It all just sort of disovles. Mary forgot to be the Serpent, or else I missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa.  Another reader pointed out: " Phillip Pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. Instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. What a waste of time. I can't believe this book actually won awards. It stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly."   It would have been better if Lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. Instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the Kingdom of Heaven in the course of her lifetime. Absurd. This was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life. 
 As an admirer of Crouch's essays, I was looking forward to this book.  But fiction is an art that Crouch has not come anywhere near mastering as he has done with the essay form.  This book reads like a  stream-of-consciousness first draft that went straight to the publisher.   Where is that laser-like precision with language Crouch is noted for?  Not  in this book 
 Do you want the real secret on how to grow your hair? First, you need to have a healthy diet that includes plenty of vegetables and protein. PROTEIN! Then you have to keep your hair and scalp clean, trim your ends, and not use heating appliances all the time! Lastly, drink water! That's the secret! You go on a hair care board and you'll find people who swear by Vivisical. They'll show you before and after pictures and in the after picture it's just the person with their head tilted all the back just to make it look like their hair grew 5 inches in 2 months! Don't believe that nonsense! If you buy Viviscal, you're a sucker! You're better off just taking a multi-vitamin 
 The acting was terrible, there was basically no plot. If this movie represents a woman's view of the Conan movie genre, then that's just very sad. Red Sonya was better 
 This thing is JUNK!!!  Don't waste your money.  I am a computer professional and I had it working for about 5 minutes, then after powering it down and back up it never did work again!  If you buy one, go through the setup and if it doesn't work immediately SEND IT RIGHT BACK TO AMAZON!  Don't waste your precious time trying to get a $70 brick to do wireless because the odds are that you will just be wasting your time.  Finally, Amazon likes to keep the good reviews toward the top of the list to keep the potential customer from being discouraged. However, YOU SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE BAD REVIEWS THAN THE GOOD ONES. If the product is in fact good it won't have many bad reviews, or even possibly none at all if it is exceptional. However, look up all the bad reviews for this product. They should tell you that something is seriously wrong with this product 
 I come with an axe to grind.  I wrote two playwriting books of my own.  But one of the reasons I wrote them is because I found so much in this one so wrong-headed.  The idea of starting with a theme or intellectual premise is so bass-ackwards as to be jaw-dropping.  In my experience, you don't start with a theme, you find yourself attracted to characters in a situation that compels you to explore them and it.  Sometime during the middle of the writing (if you're writing honestly), you may find out what the play's theme is.  But theme should emerge organically, not be imposed from the beginning.  To start with theme is like trying to build a skyscraper from the top down.  It may be where you want to go, but, like building a building, you need to start with scaffolding and a foundation.  I trust that when I'm grabbed by character and situation that there has to be some underlying thematic pull.  I don't want to force finding what this is out too early.  If I surprise myself a little, I have a good chance of surprising and delighting the audience.  Now, there is a different craft to writing the first draft and doing rewrites.  I suspect that some of Egri is more applicable to the second stage.  So, yes, obviously I prefer my own books (THE DRAMATIST'S TOOLKIT and SOLVING YOUR SCRIPT).  Also, Thornton Wilder wrote a terrific short essay on the subject in which he talks about the differences between writing fiction and drama.  Since he is the only writer to have won the Pulitzer Prize for both, he comes to the subject with credibility.    I mean, when is the last time you saw a production of an Egri play announced?  
 The title leads one to believe that this might possiably be a wonderful page turner, filled with "erotic Poetry", but as I read through these poems, I was very disappionted. I own many erotic poetry books, and found this one "not" erotic at all. These poems didn't grasp my intrest, nor provoke thought. This to me, is indeed the one of the worst displays of erotic poetry I have ever read. The poetry having no meter, nor rhythm 
 Before I purchased this product, I read several reviews, many of them very favorable. This product was also recommended by the grout cleaning/restoring company I recently used for my tile floors. Imagine my surprise and disappoinment when I discovered how utterly useless this product actually is. It does a very uneven job of distributing the cleaning solution onto the floor, and an even worse job of sucking it back up, leaving many puddles of dirty solution over the entire floor. I literally have to remop the entire floor every time I use it. I've tried other Bissel  products which were fine, but this one is an expensive dud. Don't waste your mone 
 Based on Mr. Shamsul Akmar's editorial commentary from daily English based newspaper The Star in peninsular Malaysia, is this book really worth reading 
 Worse than Postman stikes back. Horrible movie. I purchased it becuase Im a huge fan of Tony Jaa. Though he is on the cover his part is small, and pointless. He has nothing to do with the story, shows up to fight the main character only to be killed by him. His part is less than 5 min. The rest of the movie is garbage. if youre looking for stunts, or anything like UNG BAK, this is not it. Not even the fight scenes are worth watching 
 I read this whole book, but only because I'd already spent $11.49 on it.  I like Romantica and I don't have high literary standards, but this book fell short even for Ellora's Cave.    The book starts out by telling you that Denny is in love with her boss, Gabriel, who doesn't seem to notice she's alive.  Then along comes Gabriel's best friend, who offers to have a threesome with her and Gabe, because he's sure once Gabe has sex with her he'll realize that he's been in love with her all along.  This does, in fact, happen.  It's not the worst premise in the world, it's just so poorly crafted that it doesn't work.  First, the entire book is one really long love scene between Gabe, Jonah and Denny.  In the midst of this incredibly long love scene, there are numerous flashbacks to conversations between Jonah and Denny, repetive inner monologues in which Denny and Gabriel reflect on how much they love each other, and Denny's desparate (and repetitive) wish that she can "melt the ice around" Gabriel's heart and get him to admit he loves her.  Oh yeah, and Gabriel's obsessive worrying that if he kisses Denny he'll be completely in love with her forever, which he simply can't deal with because he's traumatized from the death of an old girlfriend (you find out about the girlfriend at the end, but by then it doesn't matter).  Who wants all these flashbacks and monologues in the middle of a love scene?  Generally, it's a better idea to get to know the characters before they make love.  It's all backwards here.  But the poor plotting is not the worst thing about the book.  The writing is a big pile of repetitive cliches, and there are way to many adjectives.  I laughed out loud when I read the description of Gabe's voice:  "Mellow and low, with that little rasp to it - like the evocative sound of bodies rolling over a crinkling bed of crisp, golden leaves in the height of a wind-tossed fall - the voice played through her blood like a meandering vine."  The whole books is meandering - from one meaningless cliche and bad metaphor to another.    And people keep talking with "flashes" of things in their eyes.  No one has to say anything in this book - apparently, all emotions and thoughts can be flashed to other people through one's eyes.  Hunger and need are flashing all over the place, and anger, resentment, desire.. you name it, it's flashing in someone's eyes.  Also, there is way too much quivering, burning, throbbing, and shuddering.  I don't mind those things in principle, but every other word doesn't have to be a romantic cliche (as in quivering, shuddering breaths, and throbbing, burning desires, and quivering shudders, shuddering throbs and so on).  This author needs a red edit pen and a thesaurus.    Add all that to the fact that there isn't any reason ever given for Denny and Gabriel to feel anything for each other, and the book just isn't worth reading.  I can suspend belief long enough to accept that Denny loves Gabe because he's hot and rich, but what does Gabe see in Denny?  Why do he and Jonah think she's so beautiful?  According to Denny, she's dumpy and plain, and her character certainly doesn't do or say anything interesting in the course of the book.  In fact, she could have been a blow-up doll for she contributed to the never-ending love scene.  There is minimal character development (only what can occur through repetitive use of cliched description), and no kind of plot tension at all.  I gave it two stars instead of one, because if you skim the purple prose you can find a couple of relatively erotic moments that aren't completey ruined by the bad writing.              
 Type was too small for practical use in the kitchen. Ifound the chapter on equipment to be somewhat lacking by not discussing all alternatives such as the section on cutting boards only mentions one type and does not discuss the pros and cons of wood, glass, etc.  The tips are all pretty much the same tips and ideas I got from my first copy of "Joy of Cooking" 40 years ago.  The best, and certainly not the greatest, portion of the book was the recipes.  Several were very good 
 I enjoyed the tour through literature and philosophy and felt the author did a good job of outlining the nature of the problem.  Like other reviewers I was disappointed with the emphasis on Christianity in the end- with graphics of the tortures of hell and commentary about death being the greater leveler.  Until I got to that section I sustained the belief that Alain de Botton was writing with some neutrality.  His emphasis on Christianity, while ignoring other world faiths and spiritual beliefs have to offer, admits bias and disappoints greatly as the book comes to a close.  Certainly Buddhism, for example, would have much to say about status anxiety as well?  The first part of the book is much more rewarding to read.  By the end of the book when the author starts biasing his comments within an unexpected Christian framework, shattering my belief I was reading a neutral book with intellectual integrity, I was truly sorry I had recommended it to a friend 
 What ever you do, don't buy this even if the price drops down to two pennies.  If there was a ZERO to rate this movie I give  it one.  This is a fine sample of false advertisement.  They put the cover of Donnie Yen in a most muscular pose, making the consumer think they're going to see an spectacular Shaolin temple fight.  This movie doesn't even show Kung Fu or any type of martial arts.  This is outrageous!  I was going to ask for a refund but sending the movie back would cost more then  what it's worth.  The story is a rediculous cop story with no Shaolin fighting what so ever.  As a matter fact this is one of Donnie Yen's very first movies,  He looks like a nerd!  real skinny wearing glasses! When was this movie shot? in the early eighties?  Don't expect to see the Donnie Yen in the false advertisement cover of this Movie.  Or the Donnie Yen from "Iron Monkey" or "Fist of Fury" - This movie,"Fist of Fury" is a remake of the late Bruce Lee "Chinese Conection" by Donnie Yen, this movie is the one to own! Get "Fist of Fury" by Donnie Yen.  He is in the best shape of his life.  The action is nonstop from begining to end.  No wire work here, except for some fast forward on some scenes to make him look speedier then Bruce.  Shaolin  vs Devil's Omen, if they offered it free I wouldn't take it! The space on my shelf is worth more. So Halloween movie hunters, BEWARE!  
 I haven't tried the hands-free device and probably won't bother, but the case is cheap looking and the charger didn't work at all.  As they say, you get what you pay for!  I'm going to an actual store and get a real Motorola accessory kit.  Don't bother with this one 
 I buy MANY albums for one song...  this one was no different.  If you are REALLY a Donnie Iris fan, get it, otherwise, try to buy the song you want from iTunes.  It's not worth 20 bux to get one song 
 I bought this book hoping for a Christian perspective on the Christian-themed The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown.  What I paid for is unabashed preaching on how the Gospel can be spread through never re-interpretting or revisiting the collection of stories called the Bible.    These two theological scholars don't add any additional light to Brown's story nor do they actually show proof that the DaVinci Code couldn't have been true (which, in fact, I agree that most of Brown's work is fictional interpretation.)   It seems like another opportunity for Christians to talk to themselves and reinforce a narrow viewpoint through villianizing the "mass media" and the general population.  Pure back-patting fluff 
 While Julia Barrett touches on the language "spoken" in Jane Austen's novels, it's not expressed with any feeling or wit.  The words seem to be a jumble of Austenique words placed to look good, but not sound good.  After chapter 11 the book goes into a million different directions, is narrated from several characters points of view, leaves almost no room for the main characters (Charlotte Heywood) views to be expressed, her feelings to be voiced and is just plain messy.  In most of Austen's novels, you have an opportunity to see the relationship grow between the main charactor and her "intended".  In Charlotte, you wonder how they fell in love at all.  They rarely see one another, they rarely speak and when they do, it's mostly short and nonsensible.    Then there is the plot line, or rather shall I say lines for there are several (thank you Mr. Collins).  There is the plot to save Sandition by gaining a physician, by adding a Crescent, allowing racing gentleman and their horses (and then the sub-plot to this to keep them out)and then the smuggling and bootlegging.  Dear me!  How did anything get done?  I confess, I got bored and just scanned the rest of the book!  Honestly, I was disgusted.    If you love Austen's last novel and would like to see how she may have ended it, let me recommend a book far superior to Charlotte.  Instead try Sandition.    Sandition does tend to get a little flowery in some places.  Charlotte Heywood does tend to get a little flustered and unable to speak her mind around Sidney Parker.  However on the whole, it's a much more convincing end to Austen's last attempt.  The characters actually grow.  They learn.  Here is an example.  In Charlotte: Arthur Parker is an "invalid" who learns that perhaps he is not so invalid and then spends the rest of the book remarking to his intended, also thinking herself an invalid, about how herorically he withstands his difficulties with stomach ailments.  To which she agrees and says that they only can know how much each endurs to live with this horrid desease.  And then they proceed to expound on how proud they are over their problems and attempt to live with them.  (sigh).  In Sandition:  Arthur Parker is an "invalid" who realizes that perhaps, not only is he NOT an invalid but that there are people fairing far worse then him and do not complain.  He falls for a young woman who truly is fragile but makes no complaints, only attempts to live each good day she has to the fullest.  He learns from her what it is to be healthy.  They both grow and support each other in a common goal that gets them out of a smoke filled tea room and into the fresh sea breezes.  He collects and she draws what he collects.  He learns to protect her (instead of whining over his bouts and supposed illnesses) and she learns to be stronger.    Sandition is also a book in which you can actually SEE Charlotte and Sidney fall in love.  You can watch her struggle over "does he or does he not".  It's a much more delightful alternative to all the "our herione" and "our hero" and "my herione" and "my hero"'s that go on in Charlotte (if I read one more of those I thought I would choke).    So, to sum up?  Don't Don't Don't waste your time, money or energy on Charlotte, but DO get Sandition.  It's a welcome addition to Jane Austen's library 
 Why doesn't anyone ever talk about the atrocities other countries and religions have done? No one talks about Darfur or what the head Palestinians do to their own people. We must realize that Muslims are just as much to blame for genocide and destruction as everyone else. I'm not just talking about towards Americans or other communities, but within their own community and families. Has anyone ever heard of "honor killings?" They happen all the time in supposedly moderate Muslim countries like Jordan. But it's okay to talk badly about Jews and other ethnic groups/religions, but not Muslims or it is an outright attack. Some people need to look at themselves and be truthful about what they are doing instead of blaming others.   Israeli is constantly under attack (verbally and physically) and this instigates the violence. It's nothing new. I don't condone killing and violence, but I feel that people do make things worse for themselves by inciting it. What is happening in the middle east is nothing like what Hitler did or what is happening in Darfur.

 I picked this item up for my 6 year old nephew who loves science.  We put it together one night and I was surprised to find that the base and volcano are incredibly thin plastic that crack under any pressure at all. The plaster/sand mixture was impossible to work with, it just balled up into clumps and there was no real way of spreading it around smoothly. We both ended up with plaster all over us. Once it had dried, he was excited to get to paint it. As soon as he began to paint, parts of the plaster started breaking off in chunks.  Hooking the plastic tubing up was not a major problem but I had issues keeping it hooked together. The "pump" system was supposed to send vinegar into a baking soda chamber to push up into the volcano. Instead the "pump" (which was a squeeze bottle) pushed the vinegar weakly upwards and then once it hit the baking soda chamber it clogged up. When it finally made its way out through the volcano after me squeezing the bottle as hard as possible, it barely trickled out. Once it had trickled enough, the rest of the plaster fell off as it got wet. He and his sisters just looked at me and asked "Is that it?" After three tries we trashed the whole thing. Also, the "rock samples" that they give you in the kit are the size of the tip of your fingernail. I'm a geologist and these are not rare, expensive rocks. There was no reason to not include larger samples.  He was very disappointed in the whole thing and so was I. I can't believe that the Smithsonian put their name on this product. We'll go back to our plaster volcano with vinegar and baking soda 
 Anyone who is (1) sane, (2) breathing, and (3) knowledgeable about Jensen's essays and Op Eds, knows he's a desperate academic who makes indefensibly inane assertions in a sad attempt to attract attention. Unfortunately, in the academy, one needs neither intelligence nor originality to succeed; rather, one only needs to be "progressive," which means formulating the most politically obtuse and obscene ideas one can, replacing the obscenities with grad-school words, and--to make sure it sounds "academic"--removing all traces of narrative cohesion. Jensen consistently succeeds at this sublevel of writing. If the world were remotely just, I would be able to sue Jensen for the 2 hours of my life I wasted on this book. Giving this book one star is an act of infinite charity 
 Mr. Ricketts begins well. Kipling's ancestors are well drawn. His first years in India are well done. The years back in England when he was 7-17(roughly) are very well written. The first years as a journalist back  in India, when Kipling had great success with poems and stories, is well  doen too. So, the first 140 pages are useful. Then the book gets really  boring. Kipling leaves India,  circles the world and lives in Englamnd then  the US. It's really boring. Mr Ricketts seemed to run out of energy. So  read the first part and skip the last 
 But they tried WAY TO HARD to supercede Front Page News and to make it MORE SUCCESSFUL. Failed at both attempts!  This was a big slump period for the band at this point in time.  In fact most of these songs when performed live, HAD the intense fire, these studio versions lacked. 'Way of the World' scorched everytime I heard it live, but on No Smoke Without Fire, well it was a smouldering flicker.  This was one of their biggest letdowns with Laurie Wisefield on second guitar.  The live tracks included here (Lorelei) are nice but are hardly indicative of what 'couldve been', if that energy was put to better use for this project 
 I adore his series with Precious in No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency and purchased The Sunday Philosophy Club in high hopes.  I could not finish it.  I forced my way through half the book hoping it would get better - it didn't.  I finally realized after a month went by and I did not pick it up that I was just not going to finish it.  So I traded it in at a local used book store.  I just never grew to care about the main character and the plot did not progress.  The main character was just a monstrously bored busybody.  I did not see any justification for her actions throughout the book.  And the endless talks of ethical and philosophical dilemmas were grueling - I skimmed through them.    I have been telling everyone not to bother with this book.  It was very disappointing 
 Hmm, quite a disappointment, especially after splurging on the hardcover edition.  Set as a kind of "Rockies Rear Window," this is one slow story.  Endless pages of crazy-making when I'd already guessed the outcome about halfway through.  Finally skipped ahead to finish the book.  I had really looked forward to Angels Fall, too :(  If you are a Roberts fan, don't spend the money on the hardcover, wait for the paperback, go to the library, or borrow from a friend.  Not worth the price. 
 If you want to have a less fantasized and a more detailed biography of Ataturk, you should read Patrick Kinross or Andrew Mango. This book is close to fiction than to history. Some parts are exagerated to create a tension and a push to read the text. Moreover the narrative usually does not give any clue why he moved in a certain way. During the book the plot is more important than the information. If you are distant to the history of Ottoman Empire or Turkey, you may easily adopt an unrealistic view 
 The paper version is a real touchstone for the practice of all manner of applied mathematics.  The CD-ROM version belongs in the discount bin.  Here is why:  1)  The CD-ROM is edition 5; but edition 6 has been out for 4 years.  2) The DynaText software, which is needed to read/browse/search the book, is showing signs of age.  It works fine on the computers of a decade ago but not necessarily on the machines of today.  See the review of J.F.Groote.  The product is advertised as working on Macs but will not work on most Macs.  Specifically, it does not seem to work on either G4 or G5 hardware with OS X, even under the so-called "Classic" mode.  I believe that the problem is that the browser is shipped as an executable that requires a specific architecture.  It is usable under Windows, but you might need to use one of the backwards-compatibility options to run the installer.  It will not apparently run under any form of Linux, the most recent (and rapidly becoming the most popular) transmogrification of Unix.  Again, DynaText is put on the CD-ROM as a binary executable; if you are not using SunOS 4 or 5, Solaris or SGI IRIX 5.2 then you can not use this product 
 I ordered 4 towels and it stated in my email they would be shipped in one package. I was charged for four seperate shipping fees, one for each towel. Three towels are scheduled to be delivered on the 22nd, the fourth on the 25th. I am wondering why my towels were shipped in seperate packages, when the weight certainly did not exceed shipping weight 
 This book seems to have a wealth of information and includes a CD with numerous forms, the Word documents are very useful.  The PDF forms are not.  The problem is none of them are editable.  Why even include them?  Why not creat them in Word format?  This is unsatisfactory and a complete waste of time.  Why even provide the forms electronically if you can't customize them, you might as well buy a book with the paper forms and photo copy them 
 I know that this film is supposed to be a masterpiece, but I fail to see how anyone can interpret this film that way.  I was surprised to see Jeff Bridges is such a boring film.  I found that this film wandered too much in the beginning.  I watched the first hour and noted that there was hardly any character or plot development!  I found that the movie never really amounted to anything.  I believe that this movie is not even worth renting!  If someone can explain to me how they could interpret this movie as an excellent one, please feel free to e-mail me with an explaination, otherwise, my feelings towards this movie will stay the same.

  Simply put: Don't support the Faux News Channel or anyone affiliated with it.  There are much better ways to spend your hard earned money 
 I love Ray Charles when Ray's doing Ray.  This was terrible.  Ray was out of tune, out of touch and the song selection was ridiculous.  I'm sorry Ray, I love you.  It's a shame this had to be one of your last CD's 
 Before I picked up this book I knew that it was written by a ghost writer, posthumously. But since it was a "sequel" I wanted to get it anyway. What a waste of time! It is obvious that Harold Robbins had jotted down some notes and ideas and someone with no talent whatsoever had tried to make it into a novel. It is fairly clear to distinguish some of the passages that are Robbins' and then there are those that he would be ashamed to even look at. There is actually a part where the same sentence is repeated, with two words changed, on the next page. The intensity of characters, the eroticism, the storytelling that are so evident in most of Robbins' work is nowhere to be found in The Secret 
 I was one of Entertainment Weekly's charter subscribers way back in 1990. It started out great -- a different, intelligent and witty approach to entertainment coverage. But financially, things were shaky, so the magazine was dumbed down a bit to reach a wider audience. I couldn't blame the editors. It helped them reach the needed tipping point, and they gained their needed mass audience. EW remained better than any other publication with an entertainment focus, and I kept resubscribing.  Until 2006. These last few months, EW has fallen off a cliff. It has become entirely superficial and shallow, with hardly any substance at all. The publication design has also been degraded into a teen magazine format. I can only imagine the editors have decided that anyone over 30 is no longer part of their target audience. So, I've let my subscription lapse -- reluctantly, mourning the enjoyable magazine that used to be 
 UNFORTUNATELY, I NEVER RECEIVED THIS BOOK AND I AM UNABLE TO RATE IT!  THE CLASS IS IN THE SECOND WEEK.  I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO BORROW THIS BOOK FROM THE PUBLIC LIBRARY TO KEEP UP WITH THE CLASS READING. I HAVE CONTACTED SAID BOOK COMPANY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.  THE REPLY I RECEIVED WAS THAT THE BOOK WAS ENROUTE.  I ORDERED A BOOK AT A LATER TIME, IN FACT TWO OR SO WEEKS AFTER THIS ONE AND RECEIVED IT IN LESS THAN A WEEKS TIME. I AM STILL WAITING ON THE ARRIVAL OF SAID BOOK 
 When mated to a Sony wide-angle lens, the on-camera flash becomes partially blocked causing a dark area in the photo. A major flaw in my opinion.  Sony makes no mention of this on the packaging 
 Since we bought this to work with our Mac, we have had nothing but problems.  If asked to print one page of a document only, it freaks out, all the lights flash and has to be turned off an on again to reset it and calm it down!  Have had long sessions with HP customer service on the phone and they haven't a clue.  If we could have been bothered, we would have taken it back, but just live with the fact that we have to print excess pages (at least we do recycle).  There are various other things that also cause it to freak and flash, can never work out specifically what, we just sigh and reset it.   Will be looking for something else to upgrade to soon 
 I can't say I liked this book.  I found it was incredibly boring with no writing style whatso ever.  And the plot could have been taken from a 'typical science fiction' receipe book.  Honestly.  I barely managed to  finish it.  Thora had potential.  Nothing else did.  She didn't even change  in the course of the book.  Leave this one in the bookshelf.  Its not worth  the time 
 While Morison does admit to the genocide of the Indians lead by Columbus and his henchmen, it idolizes him for the duration of the book. A brief admittance of guilt, for Morison, is a surefire way of allowing a much more bias, idealistic portrayal of a man with "questionable" character traits. Bartolome De Las Casas, a European minister who lived in the same time as Colombus, gives a much more realistcally bleek look at the Spanish invasion of the Americas. Because Morison's focus shifts so rapidly from the bad to the good, it loses major points for realism. The book reads more like a 3rd grade textbook; Morison would have us believe Santa Claus and the toothfairy exists along side a saintly Christopher Columbus 
 I had got this earlier and thought the piece was defective and so I did not hear any sound. Could not return as I had the receipt drycleaned! So I got another one - and the sound is audible only if I cup my hand and shout into it! Why on earth would Sony design and sell this product? This time I have the receipt and surely will return it 
 The book I would say is good if you are willing go insanely above and beyond the normal realms of getting a job...most of the info. is pretty easy to figure out on your own, but if structure is needed this can be a good guideline.  Over all it did not do much for me, but it might work wonders for others. 
 What a disappointment.  I was looking forward to Anne Perry's new series, hoping for another set of lively characters and satisfying stories, driven by good writing and informed by history and period details.  But the most charitable thing I can find to say about this book is that perhaps it will have been worth slogging through if it sets up better plotting and characterization in the rest of the books in the series.  It certainly doesn't stand alone as a novel:  despite its 300+ page length, it's populated with paper-thin characters, some of whom appear only once and to no purpose, carry on interminable and uninteresting conversations (or internal monologues) that fail to advance the extremely flimsy plot, which HAS NO PAYOFF.  This book felt like Perry has become so enamored of her own prose style (which is, as ever, exemplary) that she's forgotten to give us people and a mystery (or at least a story) to care about. 
 Led Zeppelin were simply the most overrated band of all time who were just as bad as NIRVANA and ACDC. They only made about a decent song in "Stairway To Heaven". Rest of the songs just STINK!!! Plant sounds more like a big monkey than a real singer and can't sing at all, HE JUST SCREAMS. Like good singers??????? I recommend go with Foreigner, Dire Straits who were equally the greatest bands with the greatest singers in LOU GRAMM, and MARK KNOPFLER. They are a billion times better than LED ZEPPELIN. Don't listen to the five star reviewers of this page, avoid this piece of junk and go with Foreigner insted. They are legends, not ZEPPELIN!! 
 Koontz has been hit and miss throughout his carrer -- and that's true of any author this prolific -- but this miss was catastrophic. So unbelievably unbelievable it's hard to believe. What you're asked to swallow as explanation is totally absurd. It's "Oh my gawd!" bad. Don't waste your time 
 I already knew that Michael Savage was a draft dodger since I always check the New Hampshire Chickenhawk Database. From some reason they do not have his birthday. According to the official "Name Authority" from the Library of Congress database, his real name is Michael A. Weiner and he was born March 31, 1942. But why is he a hypocrit regarding American soldiers like me?  Dr. Weiner/Savage does the usual butter-me-up, like on page 104. He talks about former Hollywood actors who served in WWII, "True American heroes yes...They, unlike the empty suits of today, fought shoulder-to-shoulder alongside America's finest young boys. The farmers, the steelworkers, the taxi drivers. The people who made this country great." The only problem here is that he is describing MY family and not his.  His image of former soldiers is extremely negative and very offensive to me. In describing a veteran expressing his true feelings about war "war is awful..he never wanted to fight, he didn't believe in fighting although he wore the uniform [what do you mean Weiner?] and yes he was a hero and has many medals even though he naver actually fought." This isn't even the pot calling the kettle black. "Their anti-war comments both undermine our troops' morale and encourage our enemies by creating a picture of a divided front." Weiner also states, "[t]he ill-informed comments of these camera-craving, ex-military types in the attempt to prop-up a sagging self-esteem, do extensive damage to the war on terror and our military." Keep that second comment in mind, but who is the guy with the self-esteem problem? He doesn't have any "fake" medals so who is he to criticize a person who actually served?  If anybody is harming our troops it is Weiner/Savage. On page 88 he actually tells us it is okay for al-Qaida to kill our soldiers. Really. "If you were a leader or an intellectual in the Muslim world and you saw the debauchery promulgated by the West...and saw your young people gravitating toward the filth pumped over your airwaves, what would you do? Frankly you would support al-Qaida or any organization [like al-Qaida in Iraq or the Taliban in Afghanistan?] that would want to stop that flood of pollution from entering your country." Thanks for clearing up why it is okay for these guys to kill our soldiers. And here I thought they just hated our freedoms.   There are other problems with this book. On page 108 he decries the "intense use of drugs." Yeah, like Limbaugh's abuse of Oxycontin that he forgot to mention. Most diturbing to me is his use of words such as "sheeple," which is word coined by racist Aryan Nations members. Why he would use a favorite word of anti-Semites, seeing as how Weiner/Savage is a Jew, as well as a word used extensively by Timothy McVey is quite strange. He also uses dismissive language like "leg-crossers," (page 85)which I assume is a substitute for "bitch." And, finally, for all of you steelworkers, taxi drivers, etc., who are his fans: this guy thinks you're dumb. All you need to do is read page 106 to see what he thinks about opinions of non-college graduates.  As one last snipe on this guy, I just love that photo of him (all photos are of him) in the book, under the line "my ship has come in." That is one big yacht he is at the helm of. To his question of where to steer his yacht, how about towards the Gulf and to join the fight? I did ny combat, now you do yours. 
 I have a large family (9 sisters, 1 brother, plus their kids, etc.), so this book wasn't very helpful.  Also, the tips for getting family members to help out with the cake and misc wedding stuff, DUH! The crafty members of my family are going to help me out to cut the cost.  This guide is not practical at all. Save your money and be creative with ways to cut costs for your wedding 
 I hated this book!  It is such a disappointing series after reading The Other Bolyn Girl which I absolutely loved.  This series is centered around a incest - which is detailed graphically in the book(s).  Very disappointing 
 I can not describe how painful this book was.  The first quarter of the book goes at the pace of a moderately entertaining tale, but then grinds to a halt as soon as Silas is leashed with the orphan girl.  This book stands out in my memory not just for instilling a loathing of the written word that nearly took my away from literature for the rest of my life, but for the great amount of negative space it left in my brain when I try to recall some of the "excitement" of the drudgery of Silas's everyday life.  Truly a GREAT classic to unload on junior high children 
 I thought this was an awful book.  The author cobbled together press clippings and an infatuation.  I bet Fred Couples was sorry he ever talked to her 
 After reading this book, I can now see why Washington State's OSPI is in such a terrible state.  Could someone please set Washington's educational system free from its New Age Mentality?  
 When I first wrote a review for this movie I will confess that I was angry that it did not have any demons or evil monsters from hell, but upon further review I must take back my previous opinion, and say that though Doom the movie does not carry the spirit of doom into it it is still a pretty good movie. I believe that if the movie had been more original then I would have liked it (except for the first person part of the movie wich is why the rating is not higher aside from not being original). Overall as much as I hate to admit it this is a pretty good movie and worth watching (yes this is leaving a bad taste in my mouth) so go ahead and watch it it is by no standard the best video game based movie ever but decent overall.                                SORRY ABOUT MY FIRST REVIEW 
 Short and sweet the maps suck, theres nothing you can't find online for free and its poorly put togther. There will be far better fan produced guides soon, avaiable online for free.. 
 I was greatly disappointed when I read this book after being given a copy of it by one of my Mormon friends.  I'll be the first one to tell other people that it's important to respect other peoples' religious traditions.  However, I find it a lot easier to respect the Mormon's religion than to respect their holy book.  This book strikes me as neither interesting nor deep.  The style of writing is rather uniform, unlike older texts which were compiled from a variety of sources and have been preserved for thousands of years.  My biggest complaint about this book is how it so transparently presents the dominant values of the society that Joseph Smith was living in.  The Jesus that appears in the book of Mormon is not the same Jesus that lived and died two thousand years ago, and whose life and teachings are documented in the four gospels and in other texts.  The Jesus in this book is oversimplified...he does not lead people through the countryside teaching them slowly and in parables, and he does not challenge the authority of organized religion--in contrast, he seems to support the notion of organized religion to some degree.  He simply appears and spouts out a bunch of stuff all at once, in a very simplified fashion, and what he spouts includes a lot of the dominant values from Joseph Smith's society--stuff that has little, if anything, to do with the original Jesus.  I've always wanted to re-write this book.  Maybe I will some day.  I haven't had any divine inspiration to do so, however, and apparently no one else has either...so until this day comes, we'll have to deal with it as it is.  I have a feeling it's not particularly high on God's list of priorities 
 The original, full-length version of this classic is not available anywhere, for any cost.  If you watched this on HBO growing up, you will not be able to find the same version.  There was a VHS version that has since become unavailable.  There never was a full-length, unedited version available on DVD.  Even the version with Kermit on the box has been signigicantly edited.  This is what's availble.  It sucks, but for $10.00, it might do to hold you over until the people at Henson Productions get their act together 
 Amazingly bad book. As someone who loves Seinfeld and Philosophy, I found this book insulting for both, and espacially for the readers. I tried reading parts of it, and simply couldn't bring myself to finish any chapter. Just a bunch of jiberish from people who apperently don't like, know, or "get" Seinfeld very much.  The straw that got me to finally give up (and write this review) is when I read that Seinfeld was not the first to write a comedy about nothing, and that "Much ado about nothing" is also such a comedy. What, the writer just googled "about nothing" to find something which has a similar title ??? Discusting 
 I thought that this would be a book with reproductions of typical art deco motifs but it turns out to be one artist's interpretations of Art Deco, and in my opinion the results are pretty ugly.. 
 This is a horrible edition of this game.  It has a limited amount of games and it doesn't play like the TV game at all.  Save some money and buy the old boxed editions from [...] or get the newest version...you'll like it a lot more. 
 Does anyone even care that the "Author" John Miller, formerly of ABC's 20/20 and then the head of counterterrorism for the LAPD, is currently the Assistant Director of Public Affairs for the FBI in the BUSH regime...I mean...Administration.  This book is Propaganda. Period 
 Mr. Conroy's idolization of the Colonel is obvious, but the book is slow moving, hard to follow and definitely hid his literary genius to be shared with us in his later writings 
 I bought this product in Rite Aid.  Unfortunately, it irriates my face.  They are scamming people just to buy this product.  Instead of repairing my face, this product damage my face. There are a lot of wierd red spot that grows on my face since I start using this.  Now, I need to go to the dermatologist and have a surgery due to this product.  If I knew this will happen, I will not waste my money to buy this product. 
 I liked the pace, flow ,and language of this novel. My problems stemmed from character behavior, having grown up in Texas I could not relate to these boys. I can not imagine any scenario where a groupsof teenage boys would get together to go have sex witha calf. I'm not naive to think this has never happened, it muight even happen on a regular basis, but not as a group activity with half the high school there to watch. Like ise there is no great homophobic group than teenage boys and for the author to say they made a habit of grabbing for each other's privates came across as unbelievable. Once I can't beleive a books characters, I no longer care about the story.   
 This book is more of a magazine (with advertisements!).  While it has many cute pages that parents have made with a photo or two, the descriptions of how each page was done are only useful for people who have enough scrapbooking experience to recognize the brief and sometimes obscure references to paper and lettering sources.  There are almost no explanations of how the pages were created (no step by step instructions or tips or anything) except to identify the sources of the products used.  A big disappointment 
 The many toubled, undemocratic areas of Africa don't have leaders that have sworn to stop at nothing until the United States is destroyed.  Whether or not he actually had the capability to do so, the leader of Iraq did so swear and he did lead the world to believe that he had such capability.  But thanks for commenting.  As for the film, I know it won a couple Oscars and all, but I just didn't like it.  I thought the editing was poor, that the scenes were long and often unnecessary.  Although the story was good, a modern director would have put it together a lot better 
 There was no conspiracy. It pains me to say that, but it is true. The government is not capable of pulling it off, I promise.   Lee Oswald acted alone, we did land on the moon, there was no alien landing at Roswell NM, RFK was murdered by a lone nut as was MLK (maybe James Earl Ray's brother knew about it in advance), We are not in Iraq for Halliburton (they had more contracts under Bill Clinton), FDR did not know about Pearl Harbor....none of it makes sense. America seriously needs to move on and tackle more serious issues (like the fact that we are going bankrupt). Seriously, young people around the country hate the US because adults tell them that the CIA killed JFK and the President sends troops to war to make money for Halliburton (morons like Phil Donahue!!!)....please grow up...   As for this book...read all the conspiracy you want...Brennen SAW Lee Oswald DO it!!! Go to Dealey Plaza (I have been there several times), it is very small....from the spot Brennen was standing you could honestly tell if somebody in the 6th floor window was wearing braces, or had on a POLO brand Shirt, or had not shaved that morning. There is no way that Brennen would mis-identify a person from that close a distance. This is the same reason that a grassy knoll shooter is not feasable. Honeslty, A rifle, from 90 ft? I could have hit JFK with a baseball from the Grassy Knoll..and about 200 people would have seen me do it and I would not have moved 50 ft before I was tackled. Again...go there and look...the grassy knoll is about 25 ft from where Zabruder stood (from an elevated stance), all he had to do was turn his camera another inch or 2 and we would have a clear view of the area behind the picket fence. He did not do so because his attention was not drawn there...because there was nobody shooting there!!! Rifle Fire is LOUD, and unmistakable!!! God Damn Jack Ruby for causing this mess!!  
 Has this been any other author, I would have stopped reading after the first few chapters.  But as is sometimes the case with her earlier works, I kept reading on in hopes that the book would get better - it didn't.  After I got through enough of the book (having only about 100 page left to read), I just had to skip to the end to get the experience over with.  As another reviewer worded, this was quite one-dimensional and the characters were a bit disturbing, but not in the good sense, and the story just dragged on for far too long.  I grew annoyed having put so much time into reading this and it was quite the let down.  Tyler's later works are much better and if you want to get of those books, you'd be better off.    I don't recommend this book at all 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 Well, the book got made, and I bought it. Maybe I'm the dumb one!  We are still (months later) trying, as we really want to eliminate the litter, but have had to research other books and the internet for more, MUCH more info. This author doesn't even offer info for more questions. It's as if he's covered every possible scenario in the world, now it's up to you, the reader, to do it.   All you have to do is read the other reviews of this book to see that he's left out A LOT of possibilities. The reader is left to his own devices to fill in the numerous blanks. And as much time and energy as it takes, I find it almost impossible to believe the author has spent time training his friends' cats, too.  It is time consuming, messy, and so far, extremely frustrating for both me and my cat.  We have followed, word for word, every instruction in the book, and have still been unsuccessful. The Saran Wrap? Bad idea - the cat falls through, every time (even with heavy duty wrap & very light Siamese cat ) which causes MUCH consternation on the part of the cat. We finally rig it so he can go again - he'll go, but doesn't like it. He has to be contained in the bathroom, and even still, will go on the floor rather than in the pot.   The pace of the training is entirely too fast, and offers no other options. Note to publisher: if you reprint this book, it needs some serious revisions 
 I am a big E&E fan and I would give 4 or 5 stars to most books in the series, but I'm not going to give this one more than 2 stars.  The introductory text that precedes the examples is way too long.  The chapter on examination of witnesses has 24 pages of text before giving a single example!!!  Compare to most other E&E books, which have no more than 2-10 pages of introductory text before getting into the examples.  Also, I am no law professor, but I found the presentation of topics a little confusing.  The explanation of the hearsay rule is very different from the one that my prof gave in class (and the prof actually drafted some of the federal rules of evidence - I am assuming he is the one who's got it right!!).  Finally most examples are really easy and not that useful except as a quick review.  The best thing about this book is that it's pretty short and can be used to get an idea of the subject before moving on to a more complete study aid or casebook. I have the 5th edition of the book - I hope the 6th (which I believe is just out) is better 
 With a nod to the author's experience, I'd say the book is light on content. The author could have provided more (and more useful) info than that which can be garnered web-surfing and hitting sites like www.backpacking.net or www.backpackinglight.com. 
 This is the stupidest book I have ever read- including Dr. Seuss! I think that Mary Pipher has some childhood issues that need to be worked out, because she stereotypes girls at a certian age as being something they usually aren't. I really can't say that it was worth the time I spent reading it 
 Fast, easy page-turner (I read it in one day) that gives interesting insight into what it may have been like growing up during the Cultural Revolution. Although it is insightful and terribly sad at times, it was way too underdeveloped and never reached its full potential. I wish the writer had gone much more in depth with the charachters and their anguish, love, fear,lives,passions and ambitions.  This was the first book I have read by this author and am curious about her other novels, only because of her positive reviews. However, this book wasn't a "must-read" at all- I would recommend it only if you have an interest in Maoist China and the Cultural Revolution, or a few spare hours to read an entire book.  
 I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment.  Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.     Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.     In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.  This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend.  For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr. 
 The sub-header to this book could very well be: "All Work & no Play makes Jack a Dull Boy".   Basically, Tom Stanley's scholarly treatise on American wealth comes down to this mind-ripping, continent-blasting conclusion:   Millionaires, you see:   1) Save more than they spend;   2) Don't spend anything.   That's it. Page after page, chart after chart, graph after graph, anecdote piling up on anecdote, all of it boiling down to the same conclusion: don't spend more than you save. Clip coupons. Hang on to your wife `til Death you do Part. Buy a rambler for 80 grand, and cling to it like a rat clutching a Big Mac in a hurricane.   To wit: if you're a good little Bob Cratchit, and burrow down in your suburban Dacha, drive the Civic, eat Top Ramen, and take your vacations at the State Museum of Knitting & the Fine Arts, you'll die loaded!Sound like fun?   Didn't think so. Look: you've got one life, and after death all bets are off. Sure, you could be hauled up by the angels to Paradise, or it could just be one plate of linguini too many, a nasty flatline and one vast inky void of non-consciousness. Either way, you're looking at one single trip on this not-so-flat Earth, so you might as well live large.   It's true, now: you can haul in major bank in whatever profession you choose: eremetic horror-writer, Wall Street tycoon, Railroad baron, small-town librarian, legal eagle defender of the Criminally Insane, whatever. And you can always outspend it. That is the source of endless tragedy and Dickensian woe throughout the ages, without a doubt.  But there pitfalls at the other extreme. Listen: I live next door to one of these McMillionaires. The guy is this enfeebled little wizened gnome of a critter, used to be a bank Vice President and got bought out because he was a dingus. Total skinflint. Miser. Goes on his own hunting trips and brings back venison, deer meat, which he forces his family of---jesus, I think 12---to eat for months. Lives in a shacky little rambler, buys used Crown Vics from the local police department and bargain basement prices.   The guy, no doubt, is high net worth. But he's also a loser.   This is a guy who didn't want to cough up a few hundred bucks to help build a joint fence between our properties---so there's a fence, even a fence that abuts his property---but beyond my house and demesne, he elected not to build a fence. Instead, he got a plastic Jersey Barricade (orange and white) and went with that. Is that any way to live? Is that really what it means to be a `millionaire'?  I think not. Half the glory of the Age of Great American Consumption is buying stuff you don't need, but want. Desire. Demand. What else is work for?  Find a way to creative bliss, work at something you're good at, that you have a real passion for, and the money will follow.   But for the Love of God, it's only Money: spend it! What is money for, if not to indulge yourself?   Sure, get a pace---plan to the end---set a budget. But how many of you want to be that newspaper column on page A3, the 95 year old dowager pauper who begged for alms on the streetcorner, ate catfood out of a tin, and scrounged for quarters by the bus stop, then was found rigid and cold in the urine-stiff sheets of her dirty bed, sprawled atop a fortune estimated at 20 million bucks? Sound like a plan? I think not. Money may not buy happiness, but it sure as hell can get you a Rolls-Royce Phantom.   "Millionaire Next Door" might have it right in its sociology---and for what it is, Stanley's thesis is meticulously researched, mustered like a well-trained army, and capable of marshalling its teeming forest of facts like a well-drilled martinet---but it's off the map when it comes down to the point of the whole thing: if you've got it, flaunt it.   "Millionaire Next Door" isn't a bad book: it's scholarly, and plods along its own hand-me-down lodestar towards its prophesied conclusion (be cheap! Die loaded!), and perhaps some folks will be astounded to discover there are some real richies down the block who in another day would have been called skinflints.   But as a map to your stars, this one is a little cramped, cribbed, dank, and stinks of mothballs. I think I'll take first class---scratch that, how much did you say that Learjet was going for, again?   JS 
 i bought this crane for a 5 yrs old boy for xmas, but i think i will return it.  there is a knob that you twist that raises and lowers the crane.  well it does raise the crane, but does not lower it.  there is not enough tension/weight to the hook part for this to work. what i had to do is turn the knob a few times and then pull the crane hook thing out manually, and even this did not work too well.  i think a kid could indeed figure out how to do something with this toy, but can't reccomend it 
 I love this swing because it goes side to side, she can sit when awake, lay down when asleep, and once you put her in she is out cold. After 6 weeks of using it I thought the battery was going, but when I changed the battery the music was still slow and I still had to keep the swinging motion on high, two weeks later it just stopped working. I'VE ONLY HAD IT FOR TWO MONTHS AND HARDLY USE IT, JUST A TOTAL OF 3 HOURS A DAY GIVE OR TAKE A FEW 
 A friend gave this to me for my 6 month old daughter - the walker itself is wonderful, but the light and sound feature is just the worst - as others have said, it dies after about 2 months, and the battery is non-replacable. My daughter loved the sounds and now they just die and warble and I can't stand it! If you buy it, don't get it for the music/lights - they will let you down 
 I agree with one reviewer, in the fact that this book is just WAY too full of useless information.  80% of this book is filler.  I couldn't even weed through all of the needless information in order for this book to make an impact on me.  I was reading, and kept drifting off, because I simply didn't care about most of what he was saying.  I wanted to become a 'Great Communicator'.  Instead, I found my patience was being tested!  I don't recommend this book for anyone who doesn't want to know every little nit picking detail about certain things like the origins of language, and certain common sense things, which he explains in FULL detail.    No need for this book 
 After anticipating the arrival of this book (that I ordered some time before publication after hearing of it), I was disappointed.  Although the subject is timely, the writing style smacks of academia and therefore, will not appeal to the mainstream (reader).  Because I'm tenacious by nature, I finished the book, but found my mind wandering throughout because it simply did not hold my attention.  Too bad - it could have been inspirational 
  The characters are not appealing and the story is not interesting. An effort to watch. Make-up, dyed hair, costumes poorly done. One man's eyebrows, the suitor's, are altered like a woman's! No scenery or homes of interest, except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor. Not a pleasant pace, without humor, without intrigue. A lesbian undertone in one scene.   The only positive thing I can think of is this good line of Jane Austen, quoted. Fanny sums up in one sentence, why she will not marry him. Women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty, will wish to sum up their certainty with Ms. Austen's line: "His sole interest is in being loved, not in loving". This line is an exception to a lifeless script.  There, now you do not need to endure the painful movie. Here are two lines re-written by me: For the woman dealing with a trifling man: "No man suffers pains of love on the stage." For dealing with the infatuated man: "You have wounded yourself, but not with love."   This movie should be re-made by someone sharing the ideals of Jane Austen. There is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film, humorous, with singing, with interest. A movie can take the best of the book, in the spirit of the book, which this movie did not carry, and make a movie better than the book. This movie is bad any which way.   Well-made period romance films are: "Pride & Prejudice 2005, 1996, & 1940", "Wives & Daughters", "North & South". Fairly made is "Under the Greenwood Tree". I rated "Persuasion" at 2-stars for the wooden acting; however "Persuasion" is 5-stars compared to this "Mansfield Park". "Persuasion" has attractive scenery, costumes, beautiful singing, and an uplifting plot; though of interest only to women, preferably who have already read the book.  
 I washed this garment according to the recommendation and it shrank about 2 sizes . . . to the point I can no longer wear it.  Bummer after just wearing it once 
 this movies horribl;e its so stupid the babies are gross and sooooooooooooooo annoing see spongebob or hey arnold or fairly odd parents skip this 
 Since Amazon split my order of two items for shipment I had to pay additional shipping charges through yet another supplier just to get the Shaver Saver.  Subtotal of Items:  1 ea. Shaver Saver was $7.68 (appeared to be a larger can than local retail; no description of size was indicated and the picture misled me!), Shipping & Handling:  $5.95, Total for this Order:   $13.63.  Darn!!  Walmart had it back in stock I noticed about a week later for under $4 plus tax for the same little 3+ ounce can 
 I have bought and returned 1/2 and 1 acre Stinger bug zappers from Costco 4 times now in the past 3 years. Thank God I was buying from Costco as Stinger products are worthless. Light attracts them but zappers don't work. Some worked for a week and others didn't zap at all. I don't know why Costco carries such a terrible product. I kept thinking, maybe these were a bad batch and I will finally get a good product. Not so, do not buy these products 
 First of all, who says George had "sad eyes"? I received this book as a gift from my Mom, who knows I love the Beatles, but knows next to nothing about the Beatles themselves. Still, she probably knows more than the author of this awful book, which was obviously written for no other reason than to exploit. Save your money. You can learn more about George Harrison by simply listening to his music and reading his lyrics 
 If you are an avid Jance fan and have come to like and expect fast-paced action and lots of excitement from the "Beaumont" books, don't buy this one.  I usually can't quit reading a Beaumont book.  I've stayed up well past my bedtime on many, many, many occasions because I just couldn't put the book down.  I will usually spend hours reading the whole book in one setting.  But this book.....well, it just doesn't cut it.  I've started and stopped it on several occasions to read something else and only came back to it when I needed "filler" reading.  For one thing, several characters have undergone major personality changes.  Beverly, who was previously sort of a mousy, quiet, obedient character has suddenly become fiesty and mouthy and full of independence.  And I scarcely recognized Lars. And the plot is too contrived and the whole Kiksadi, Quicksady, Quixote thing is really stupid.  If this is the first Beaumont book you've read, please read some of the older books.  You will enjoy them.  But don't read this one 
 Maybe it's the teacher, perhaps it's the book. But this is one of the most difficult classes I've had in my life. All I feel like doing is pulling out my hair. This book is so unclear. If you're trying to learn math, this isn't the book for you. If you want to be confused, I highly recommend it 
 This game is horrible. I rented it for 5 days and returned it 3 hours after i rented it. I had wasted 5 bucks. Its patheticic. You cant do anything, graphics are horrble, cutscenes are as long as some commercials, and the characters are gay.   Pros:  Sunny can bite, yay  Cons:  Horrbiel graphics only 3 playable characters Bad humor Short cutscenes u cant do anything 1 path game hardly 3d, (seriously, it doesnt look like it 
 For my version of this album, O.G. means old guy. For my opinion, he is not a very good rapper. He should retire pernamently 
 Fuji fails to honor warrantee - Don't buy from them  Do NOT buy the Fuji digital camera. They charged me $[...] for a fix within the warrantee period. Their support manager told my wife the cameras are not being built well and dust gets inside destroying the gears. Rather than fixing them they replace them and then they charged me for the replacement even though it still had months left on the warrantee.  [... 
 I'm surprised this book isn't banned. I'm not a prude or religious at all and believe children should learn about sex. But there's a limit to what they should know and how they should be taught. There are many other, more civilised, ways to bring up the subject. Babette Cole brings up very inappropriate subjects for kids with very inappropriate illustrations. If you think this book is shocking, try reading "Mummy Never Told Me", by the same auther 
 I thoroughly enjoyed previous entries in the "Cat Who..." series, but this one was very disappointing.  In fact, I was so disappointed in this one that I pulled out a couple of older ones to see if my tastes had simply changed!  No, the book just doesn't measure up.  As another viewer commented - too cutesy, too predictable, too little mystery.  I will look for subsequent titles at the library rather than purchase them in hardback.  I hope this is just an oddball flop 
 This is the first book I ever thew in the garbage. It was so bad that my teenager and I read parts outloud for laughs.  Here is an example of a PERFECT PHRASE on how to break bad news to the boss: "I just have made what might be a career-limiting move."   
 Alright, seriously, this book is to leadership what Who Moved My Cheese is to Civil War History.    Luckily, I've followed Coach K's career for some time and have gleaned many an important lesson from him, something not found in this book.  Lessons like: When the chips are down, act like you have an injury and cannot perform your duties and then feign responsibility for anything as a way to keep your fragile, insecure ego from showing cracks.    This worked really well with my last marriage.  My wife found me with another woman and I instantly thought "What Would Coach K Do?" so I faked like I tore my ACL and that the woman I was with was an on-call physical therapist.  Needless to say, I snowed my wife and continue to see my "physical therapist" - all thanks to Coach K.  But, you won't learn that in this book.  You'll learn other things that translate from the hardcourt to the boardroom.  You'll learn that the best way to fire up your team in a meeting is to slap the floor like crazy.  I tried that and was fired immediately.  This book stinks 
 I have used this book only when I need thermodynamic, physical or chemical data. However the other sections of this book are not practical at all, for those who can read and apply from pure math this is the one; for those looking for practical applications using the information given by this book, sorry fellas this is not the place for it 
 The controversy around Pope Pius XII's silence during the second world war are rampant as ever. This book is just another attack from the left.   Ironicly many of this Pope's staunchest defenders are Jews.   Claiming that from the middle of Hitler's ally Fascist Italy by speaking aloud against the actions of the nazis against the Jews would have saved more lives rather than endanger every Jew hiding in Catholic homes and church property is unfounded. Claiming that the Church was somehow helping with the attrocities borders on the obscene. This book condemns him for silence. This book distorts a great deal.   Overall, I didn't think much of when I read it. Having studied the Holocaust in great depth I find it rather repugnant in its accusations.    
 I did not like this book very much. The author treats her subjects as if they were some sort of cockroach species under her idealistic American microscope.  It is more accurate to say that this book is an account of how expatriates "survive" in KSA and not a true representation of the nation or its people. It is full of supercilious generalizations and patronizing commentary. It fully conforms to the biased view of Muslim nations presented in the Western media.  I know many Saudis and they are nothing like the examples presented in this book. To the contrary, they are some of the most hospitable and genuine people I have come accross.  If you want the "Fox News" version of Saudi, by all means read this book 
 This book so wants to demonstrate that music was a crucial component of human evolution, as if the author, Steven Mithen, wants to explain why he felt the subconscious need to spend so much money on CDs by Queensryche, but he ultimately fails to prove causality. There is nothing inherent in music creation that helped the human species survive the ravages of hunger, disease, pestilence, and war. There was no "battle of the bands" being waged on the prehistoric Serengeti plain to demonstrate defiance of environmental pressures to adapt. Much of this book is pure conjecture, and Mithen again demonstrates that scientists are the worst group of people to explain music to anyone 
 i was so excited to read this book as i adore the gorgeous syd.but this book was a big disappointment. 
 This product is not a safe product and should not be used with your child. Not only does it give additional padding that was not intended, nor tested with your safety seat, but it also voids the warranty of the safety seat. NHTSA (National Highway Traffic & Safety Administration) is the government agency that sets standards for child safety seats and states that "after-market products" should not be used. It also does not meet FMVSS213 standards as stated in the manufacturer's description 
  I enjoyed Odd Thomas, the first novel in what is becoming a franchise for the author. I consider it one of Koontz's better efforts, but Forever Odd is no Odd Thomas.  It's a tedious, sometimes painful read.    The biggest let down in Forever Odd is the cartoon-like villain.  She's annoying, not the least bit interesting, and more pathetic than she is menacing.    The plot itself is thin.  Koontz stretches things out, giving us more detail than we need about the tunnel system beneath Pico Mondo and loading his sentences with as many adverbs and adjectives as he can.  Odd himself was endearing in the first novel but in Forever Odd his musings get too preachy for my taste.  The life affirming ending was meant to be poignant but I found it sappy.   And was Koontz serious when he killed his villain by random cougar attack?  A cougar?  Really Dean?  That's the best you could come up with?   Sometimes Koontz hits, sometimes he misses. Forever Odd is a miss. 
 Don't buy if you plan on printing often...runs out very very fast.  
 This movie set out to demonize the Weavers and did a great job of it. Far too many inaccuracies to even begin. While I understand the need to condense for the sake of a movie,this was too much. Saying this is based on the book"Every knee shall bow" is about like saying "Ben Hur" is based on the Bible 
 I've read many positive reviews of this magazine and I did receive, several months ago, a trial issue. After sending in the subscription fee, I was billed again. I wrote a note letting them know that the check had been endorsed and deposited. Yesterday, I got a notice telling me my subscription had expired after one issue. I give up. It might be good, but customer service is really lousy. What a disappointment. 
 Let me first say that I am an unlikely reviewer to be so hostile to this type of book; I am extremely committed to healthy food choices, environmentally sound policies, and all the basic values Gary Null ostensibly embraces.  I have no problem with Null's basic premise that we should consume a fresh, non-processed, plant-based diet(although some studies have concluded that those who supplement their food with some fish and dairy products are healthier), buy organic food when at all possible, and avoid toxic household products.  But I am totally outraged by Gary Null's voodoo nutrition approach to these legitimate issues.  I bought the book and promptly returned it because it was so filled with woozy-new age drivel and devoid of reliable references to support the more controversial points.  We don't need any more evidence that a plant-based diet low in trans-fats is healthier than eating at McDonalds.  This book adds NOTHING legitimate to the basic health information you can obtain from any reliable print or internet source, and is far inferior to, for instance, "The Food Pharmacy" by Jean Carper, in which virtually every statement of fact is supported by one or more scientific references.  Save your money and buy some nice fresh organic produce 
 Really, I hate to use such an overused phrase as the title for my review, but coming up with something clever is really more than this book deserves. You'd think it'd be a safe bet that a book written by people you find funny and endorsed on the back cover by people you find hilarious is going to be a hoot. You'd think that, but you'd be wrong. Instead you'd be left saying, "Jon Stewart, my man, you liked this? Seriously? Are you high? No, wait don't answer that, it's all becoming abundantly clear to me now." 
 I was not informed that the film is not in English and has no subtitles 
 Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam, guilty pleasure of the middle 80's scene, she was the queen of Freestyle by that time, her music was around every club, and her style will remain in many people minds.  Her sounds were extremely danceable, although some people thought that her voice was a little bit squirky and anoying, it fitted just great to the type of music she wanted to approach, even her hit ballad "All Cried Out" a bittersweet melody with amazing lyrics, that will be covered later by many, fitted her just great, but undoubtly her greatest achievment was dance music, "Head To Toe", "Lost In Emotion", where #1's the same year and make everybody love this, sadly she became lost in more pop oriented tunes with the next albums, saving only "Let The Beat Hit Em" that it's truly a comeback to the dance music scene, but too late, the magic was lost and we should point to "Little Jackie Wants To Be A Star" as guilty for throwing Lisa's career to oblivion, but if you forget that and concentrate on the early materials you will find an artist that surface out of the bunch, because they were talented and had a new flavor to offer to the public 
 I cook healthy all the time and just got this book as a gift...I'm so unimpressed.  I'd seen Ellie's show on the Food Network a couple of times then stopped watching because the stuff she makes is still fattening if you're trying to stay in shape.  Sure it has healthy fats, blah, blah, but that doesn't keep you in shape.  I'd be a bit forgiving if the stuff actually tasted great, but it's mediocre at best.  The book is no different.  And she's not even fun to watch like Rachel or Giada.  I have a pile of healthy cookbooks and diet books this one is definitely my least favorite.  
 This is a 12-page promotional piece for Kouzes' and Posner's books and Leadership Practices Inventory, a 30-item questionnaire about leadership, written in the breathy style of business-school literature.  A true non-value.  If you are interested in their work, buy The leadership Challenge (Jossey-Bass, 1997), which has the same editorial tone but at least says something 
 GOD..."WAY DOWN YOUNDER ON THE CHATTACHOOCHIE"??? THAT'S THE FUNNIEST THING I HAVE EVER HEARD OF. THIS IS THE WORST COUNTRY MUSIC AROUND! IF YOU LIKE COUNTRY MUSIC LISTEN TO THE ALLMAN BROTHERS! YOU SUCK ALAN JACKSON 
 CoT is a rather disjointed attempt at a historical narrative that I strongly suspect was culled from a dozen or so different journals from settlers. This is not well done history and a rather tiresome read. I found it amazing that there was almost no discussion of the culture or way of life of the aborigines. The discussion of the English settlers seems to focus on sex and punishment. What about the organization of the colony? How did the colonists manage their day-to-day lives to survive those first worst years?  For anyone who has a serious interest in history, CoT misses the mark by a wide margin. Not recommended 
 What is Wilbur Smith's obsession with the word "escarpment"?!?!  (I stopped count at 37). That aside, this is a pretty hefty adventure.  It caught my eye in the bookstore- the premise of a grand search for an Egyptian tomb really grabbed my interest.  That being said- the author goes a bit overboard with character/scene details, making for a 650+ page read.  Not that it's a negative comment, just a concern about length- there's no economy of words when it comes to Wilbur Smith's writing style.  He's a good storyteller, but it could be so much better with the proper editor involved (getting bogged down in the details slowed the progression of the story's pacing- something I don't appreciate in an adventure novel).  The excitement within the story is a lost a bit due to his slow-detail-oriented writing style.  Don't misunderstand me, I didn't hate it; if the premise of the story didn't interest me from the start, this is a book I would have otherwise put down after the first 100 pages 
  I'm a big fan of Mo'nique.So I could'nt wait to watch this dvd.Yet I have to say I was alittle disappionted.The cursing was to much it spoiled the humor.I could'nt focus on Mo'nique and what she was saying.Plus the jokes were dull and boring.I think I'll stick to the Parkers,Not worth the money 
 I would agree with previous reviewers, in that the burgeoning ads in this magazine over the past decade has made the magazine a chore to read.  The number of ads now easily exceed the number of pages devoted to articles.  It is also quite disturbing to note that many of those ads (possibly 50% or higher) pitch ultra high end products, such as Viking ranges, BMW's, Oceanna Cruises, trips to Bora Bora...WTF? Although I do enjoy I a luxury meal, I don't want to go into massive credit card debt purchasing products this magazine is selling.  Ocassionally, behind the clutter, I find a useful recipe; I rarely find an interesting article.  I am going to let my subscription expire at the end of the current period 
 Oh please, I could outplay these pathetic fish everyday of the week, possibly more!  What a bunch of weak white players.  Go Deakstin, Go Deakstin 
 I love running to the Marine Corps Cadence CDs.  Volumes 1 and 2 are very good.  Volume 3 sounds studio produced and more choral.  When running vols 1 & 2 are better synched for continuous running.  The transitions on vol 3 feel out of synch to me.  Others don't seem to agree and I still run to this CD;  I'd buy 1 and 2 first if you don't have them 
 Do me a favor jerkwad...DON'T use my trademark to sell your product.  Let me worry about the rest of the thieves like you on E-bay and Amazon.  Besides, you are not the first I have reported and as you have already surmised, you will not be the last.   There are laws against what you did with my mark.     If you like, get your lawyer and sue me.  I would LOVE to entertain a lawsuit against you.  You would owe me damages for every bottle of your product you sold using MY trademark.   Instead of being a leech taking short cuts and using the hard work of other legitimate businesses,  why don't you spend your hard earned money and time and build your own trademark?   You won't find Tend Skin Company using yours or any other trademark to sell our products.   I spend nine years trying to sell the first bottle of my product.  I spend millions on patent and trademark lawsuits against scum like you who cannot make it on your own but need to steal the good names of others.  I'll be damned if I am going to let you fraudulently use my intellectual property.   Again, if you want to entertain litigation, please feel free. My address is on my web site and I am ready for you.   Dr. Steven Rosen Pres. Tend Skin Compan 
 Unfortunately, this book does a poor job of bridging a gap in marital therapy self-help books. It seems a pity that there is little, if any, information out there covering the territory between books on how to save your marriage and those on how to divorce. Thus, I had high hopes to get a fresh perspective when ordering this book. What a disappointment. The basic idea of a planned separation is an interesting one, and probably helpful in some (perhaps many) situations. But this book is so poorly written that it takes a strong stomach indeed to wade through it. Filled with cutesy acronyms and psychobabble jingles, be sure to have a barf bag nearby. And the book sorely needs reworking by a competent editor to pare down her blatant and transparent self-promotion. Seinfeld could do a great episode lampooning the author- she comes through as a pathetically insecure person who can't separate her needs from those of her patients. More space is wasted on her bragging than practical (or even theoretical) advice. If her painfully self-referential style and anecdotes had some substance it would be OK, but one ends up feeling like the person deriving the most benefit from the book is the author. Perhaps the only one. But It's even more frightening to think of her attempting to function as a therapist. Scary. Somebody stop her before she writes again 
 This book is awful.  It is full of speculations and just bad science.  I am going to quote one egregious example.  The comments in brackets [ ] are mine:  "Like the brain, the human eye also evolved opposite [really!] but complementary functions.  Each human eye is a perfect mirror image of the other; yet within the each retina there resides two functionally different types of cells.  With elegant symmetry, the contrasting functions of the rods and cones correspond to the division of tasks between the right and left brain [that is quite a comparison]. "Rods named for their cylindrical shape, are extremely light sensitive.   Distributed evenly throught the periphery of each retina, they see in dim light and appreciate [the rods have feelings??] the totality of the visual field, seeing images as gestalts.  Rods share with the right brain the ability to perceive [the rods can think??] reality all-at-once [as opposed to what, a little bit at a time?]. Cones, in contrast congregate densely in a small spot in the central part of the retina...Cones have two attributes.  They appreciate [there he goes again] color and intensify clarity [whatever that means]. Concentrating on one aspect of reality at a time, [huh?] cones view the visual field as if through a tunnel. [Actually cones and rods sense light together, at the same time, and your brain integrates and intreprets all that information into a perceived image.  But the most fantastic statement is the last sentance of this quote:]  Like rods, cones report to both hemispheres, but the left is metaphorically best suited to process their input.  [That is such an absurd statement that Shlain gives a footnote, right on the same page, contradicting his non sequitor.]"  And so it goes on for page after page of drivel, I finally gave up after 6 chapters.  A lot of reviewers find this book to be thought provoking.  I think it is a sad state that our appreciation of science is so dim that people can actually find this nonsense to be of interest 
 As the author admits, the title of her "book is a misnomer." She also confesses that "Islam in the book title is potentially misleading." Those are not the only problems with the book. The entire book itself is a "misnomer" and a conflation of Islam and Human Rights. A careful reading of the Holy Qur'an would have exposed the author to the fact that the Qur'an has all the tenets of the International Human Rights Instruments and plenty more. [We have developed a power point lecture showing the connections between these tenets.] It is not surprising that Eurocentric institutions and individuals have endorsed the book at the Westview Press Web site, without an independent review of the sources that represent Islamic thought. Then, again, any work that finds a way to bash Islam, subtlely or flagrantly, becomes fodder for Eurocentrists. As we strive to foster a Dialogue between Civilizations and peaceful relationships, a careful reading and representation of one another's thoughts become the more imperative 
 Glad to see I'm not the only one who can't stand this book.  There is nothing to redeem the inferior writing, fractured plot, inconsitancies (a dragon changed color!  OMG, hire an editor, for crimminy's sake!), and completely undeveloped characters.  Weyerleaders act like petulant children, showing the worst characterists of previous "real" McCaffery characters.  The main character is alternately distrusted, then suddenly trusted, then shot at, then trusted again, for little apparent reason.  And firestone plain old does not kill dragons--ask a real writer, Todd.  You stink 
 Bottom line:  I like Al Bielek's version of the PX better.  This one is more to the original story.  I like Al Bielek's personal account of time traveling.  This book is more about the "facts" of the account.  No Al Bielek in this book 
 This is a very poorly written book. There is no coherence to it, no direction, no real point 
 Nothing happens.  At every opportunity nothing happens.  Too bad.  Other than that it was not a bad read. Bleak will be well described for you from every angle. Much like the road to Pamplona. But doggone it when the occasion arrises for some plot to develope it doesn't. Couldn't they have had some interaction with any number of persons they came across. The espied little boy?  The torture chamber operators?  I would love to tell you what a great literary achivement The Road is, and it may well be, but to me it was little more than uneventful.  Some of my fellow amateur critics have suggested Mccormack's works to be Hemmingwayesque.  Perhaps.  Not a lot going on with the 'lost generation' either.  I gave it three stars for it's potential as a short story.  Not the 'one' that the scale shows 
 It came highly recommended by a local bookshop so I was really looking forward to getting started.  Unexpectedly, I was very quickly put off, amongst other things, by the jarring, clever-clever literary references  that seemed more to be to do with an ego-trip for the author than anything  that added to the story.  Confused, I gave up after just twenty pages 
 "Internal Combustion" by Edwin Black is an entertaining but uneven history about the control of energy with a purported emphasis on the ascendancy of the gasoline-powered automobile. To his credit, Mr. Black has managed a substantive research project that has uncovered a great deal of arcane historic information about the automotive industry. Unfortunately, this preachy book suffers from an acute lack of focus, where it is suspected that the large amounts of extraneous background material was added in an attempt to obscure the book's shortcomings. Indeed, the author ultimately fails to prove his central thesis, thereby casting doubt about the validity of both his research and his conclusions.  Mr. Black opens the book with a scene depicting the burning of Thomas Edison's research laboratories in December, 1914. Mr. Black's conspiracy theory proposes that sinister forces aligned with the gasoline-burning automotive industry may have intentionally destroyed the world's one and only hope to mass-produce an electric car. Unfortunately, Mr. Black provides no evidence to prove this allegation.    Mr. Black attempts to buttress his case by explaining that electric vehicles were once utilized as taxis in New York and other major cities in the late nineteenth century and, therefore, could have and should have been mass marketed to an appreciative public. We are supposed to accept Mr. Black's thesis that success would have been an inevitable and logical outcome despite the severe weight, cost and range limitations of the electric car when compared with the gasoline automobile. In fact, while Thomas Edison and Henry Ford were still tinkering with an electric alternative a full thirteen years after gasoline-powered vehicles had already been in mass production, it is evident to the reader that internal combustion vehicles prevailed because they were affordable, the first to market and could traverse longer distances than electric cars. That all of this was not a good development for people's health and the environment is not in dispute; rather, it is Mr. Black's contention that the white-hatted purveyors of electric vehicles could have prevailed save for the obstructionism of the black-hatted petroleum industry that remains in question.    In the end, what is conspicuously lacking throughout the book is a credible attempt at analyzing and critiquing the history of governmental and popular struggle with the fossil-fuel industry. But instead of scholarship, we have a vainglorious author who is determined to salvage the barren results of two years' worth of study by substituting analysis with a highly questionable work of narrative. The end result is little more than a masquerade of nonfiction; at best, it is a book that might have limited appeal to readers who crave pseudo-historicism at the expense of intellectual rigor, consistency, insight or coherence. 
 I know how important the notion that God does everything for His own glory is to Piper and his ilk, but I don't buy that idea about God's character, which makes this book just about impossible to get behind, since Piper keeps coming back to that point over and over. The book has some inspiring moments that should motivate people toward at least giving the missionary world a hard look, but the heavily Calvinist theology that undergirds it was a turn-off for me. Piper's a fine writer, however 
 First of all, if you're serious about out-of-body or lucid dreaming check out "Astral Dynamics" by Robert Bruce. That's the bible. Now, "Conscious Dreaming" consists of personal stories and some shamanic rituals, but lacks power techniques for advanced dreamers. Anyway it's ok for beginners, who seek motivation for out-of-body exploration. It's also recommended by Marc VanDeKeere in his excellent "The Ultimate Lucid Dreamer's Manual: From Basics to Beyond" 
 This is a very clever book, as far as I could make out, but very overrated. There were a few good, suspenseful scenes, but the military action was awfully repetitious. Perhaps the action is accurate and realistic, and it could potentially make an exciting movie, but it does not make good reading.  The basic premise, that the Soviet Union starts World War III in order to get oil, was ironic, given that President Bush has repeatedly been accused of attacking Iraq for the same reason. In both cases, I found the reasoning unconvincing.  Clancy's writing is pretty odinary, and often sloppy. I was particularly annoyed by the continual use of unexplained acronyms - I tried looking them up some of them in a book containing thousands of acronyms and could only find about half of them - and the military jargon was similarly confusing. Sometimes he would use a term extensively and then 30 pages later he'd explain what it meant. I suppose it would be all right for someone with more military background than I have, but a lot of the time I had no idea what was going on. I was also put off by the continual change of scene - I counted 17 scene changes in one chapter, and there are 43 chapters.  The military strategy and tactics are fascinating, but the plot of the novel is pretty basic. The characterisation is virtually non-existent - most of the characters sound the same.  This is the first Tom Clancy book I have read, and it makes me wonder how he manages to out-sell so many superior writers 
 While I found the writing style good and the information interesting, the actual diet was unrealistic, too restrictive and lacking fun basics that make other diets tolerable. I found myself longing for spices (how bad could pepper really be?) and questioning the validity of their restriction. I couldn't stand the ground-up flax seeds in my cranberry cocktail - the texture reminded me of trying to drink mud with little bugs in it (or what I imagine that to be).  I'm not writing this to disparage anyone from trying the diet - if you can handle the restrictions and you have the self-control required, you might find this diet doable and rewarding. I tried the Fat Flush with a group from work - inspired by one woman who is able to do the flush again and again every year (she always gains the weight back). The rest of us, while successful for varying degrees of short periods, found the diet unrealistic for any long-term results - all of us gained the weight back and spurred by instant weight loss, some even picked up worse habits than they began with.  The funny thing is I found much of the health information useful or interesting, but I got rid of the book b/c sitting on my shelf it reminded  me of unrealistic goals and failure - not what I want out of a get-healthy  plan.   I'm writing this review so that others don't get sucked in by all of the positive reviews hoping for lasting results - 3 of us didn't have any 
 Our parent education book group agrees that advice-giving to parents has been complex and inconsistent. However, identifying an "odd couple" (experts who give contradictory advice) for each period of the century is arbitrary, contrived, misleading and inappropriate. Hulbert mentions that she selected advice givers who had spoken at national conferences. Otherwise, she give us little information about her biases or about the criteria she used to select individuals highlighted. Why did she choose L. Emmett Holt (not a well-known individual) and G. Stanley Hall (who focused primarily on adolescents)? The protaganist format meant that in the recent years, advice-giving "giants" such asThomas Gordon, Hiam Ginott, Jean Piaget, B.F. Skinner, Erik Erikson, and Rudolph Dreikurs barely receive mention. A history book on parent advice IS needed, not only for scholars, but also for parents to understand their own upbringing. This book barely begins to fill the need 
 I'm a shrimp fanatic, and I bought this based on a recommendation in The New York Times. While the recipes might almost be considered comprehensive, it's mostly a collection of old standbys, recipes for which you could probably pick up with a quick search on any good Internet cooking site. There's little imagination or innovation shown 
 If your body has no problems with insulin insenstitivity and you have terrific will power, then maybe this plan is right for you. but i whole heartedly disagree with his claims that certain foods with high fat content are unhealthy. ie nuts, avocados, fish oil, even butter (gasp!) he also says that eating meat in excess will cause it to rot in your intestines causing your skin and breath to smell! I've never heard of this phenomenon, I refuse to believe it, and physiologically it doesn't make sense. the only reason I gave this book one star is because of his advocation to "whole foods" which are unprocessed. contrary to what one "anti ornish" reviewer said, it's in my opinion that a huge part of the obviously unhealthy average american diet lies in the fact that heavily processed foods are bombarded with partially hydrogenated oils and preservatives. Many people in Europe eat daily by riding their bike to a local market, and preparing food that would otherwise spoil in a day or two. AND THAT IS A GOOD THING! the less a food is injected with man made hormones and chemical preservatives, the better off you are eating it. Long story short, if your protein needs aren't large and you don't have an insulin sensitivity problem, then you may lose fat  and become a bit healthier on this diet. otherwise, just make an effort to eat foods in moderation. it's as simple as that! cut out as much sugar and trans fats as possible. (no one ever needs those and in my opinion they aren't hard to live without.)and don't eat any more than you need to, to reach satiety 
 Inane, useless information from a speaker so boring I could hardly get through the 3 CD's (but felt like I had to since I had spent the money on them).   Perhaps he is a great salesperson-but I cannot see it.  I bought this on the strength of the reviews and am now convinced they were his friends or family stuffing the ballot box.  I think this information was aimed at someone in grade school, not a professional sales person.  
 What Michael Cunningham does best in this book is the little things.  Similes and metaphors and various details are almost always right on.  The story itself, told in alternating first persons, spends most of its time telling us about the characters, especially toward the end.  It seems we have four psychologists who do very little other than analyze themselves and the others.  First, people don't analyze themselves or others nearly to this degree.  Second, the characters actually do very little when not analyzing.  Two other issues are the improbable three-way love affair and Bobby's indefinable sexual orientation.  The worst problem of all is that this is a character-driven novel and I just didn't care about what happed to any of the characters 
 This was a mess. This movie gave me the feeling that I was was watching a really bad made for tv film. I was mesmerized at how deplorable the acting was. Everyone just seemed like they were sleep-walking through their roles. Viggo Mortensen is generally a decent actor but in this he acted like he was just acting in this so he could pay off a car loan. All in all, this film was predictable, formulaic and a bore. Please save your money for something worthwhile 
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 A friend of mine gave me Bad Love to read when I spent the night at his house and was looking for a book.  I started it, and took it home with me.  After almost finishing it, I called him and said I really didn't like it, at which point he started laughing and told me both he and his wife thought it was horrible, and they gave it to me as a gag!  They couldn't beleive I got as far as I did.  I like fiction, and even meaningless pop-fiction like Patterson, Stephen King, Grisham, etc., so I'm not some elitist.  With that as a background,  Bad Love is without a doubt the worst work I have ever read.  I am shocked that people have given this garbage 5 stars.  Its poorly written, has a bad plot, and....you know what....its not even worth going on.  I am only writing to warn others.  Avoid at all costs.  You would be better off shaving your head with a cheese grater than putting yourself through Bad Love.  
 I think the girl can sing but comparing her to Whitney, Mariah, and Celine is a bit too premature.  She's just yet another imitator of the aforementioned ladies.  I don't find her particularly soulful.  She thinks she can be the best by oversinging and screeching.    Another thing.  I am sick of her and her fans's attitude towards Beyonce.  I am not a fan of Beyonce either but Christina and her fans are just pure haters.  Beyonce does sing better IMO.  Her tones are better than "Xtina's" who tries to sing beyond her limits 
 I wasn't even going to write a review until I stopped and read some of the reviews for this book already online.  This book is simplistic and silly.  Joan Anderson comes off as a pretentious and giddy middle-aged person who I don't think learned a thing from her time with Joan Erikson other than to throw out some words of wisdom.  I would like to know more about Erikson after reading this book, but I wish that Anderson would just get over herself and stop thinking that her words and experiences really matter - she herself questions her own authority often in the book and rightly so, she's an overdramatic, silly woman.  If you have absolutely nothing better in the world to do for 20 minutes, read this book - but don't buy it - I'll send you mine 
 This is just a version of the manual without any sample exercises or anything.  If that's all you need, its fine.  I needed a tutorial with exercises, sample data to play with, etc.  I found just what I was looking for in "Excel Personal Trainer 2003" which includes a cd with a lot of sample sheets and step-by-step exercises.  In that book, the tutorial loads by itself but you have to manually copy over the sample spreadsheets.  BTW, I am actually using Quattro Pro 10 from Corel/Wordperfect but most things are the same or close enough to figure out 
 I bought this toy last year for me son.  He really did not care for the toy at all, but he LOVES Elmo.  The crayons were way too messy and melted really fast 
 Sister of My Heart is one of my all time favorite books--I love everything about that book and that is why I was so excited to discover the Divakaruni wrote a sequet to it. But after reading it I wish I had not. Yes, it was nice to have so many of the questions, left over from the first book, answered but this book ruined the characters for me.  My review of it has nothing against Divakaruni as a writer, she is extremely talented and gifted but I hate where the story ended up. I also hated that I no longer cared for the characters. Overall I found it to be just ordinary and almost forced.  As far as this book is concerned I would have liked to be left in the dark 
 The first few chapters were compelling, humorous and downright thoughtful.    After that, the format became a bit tired.  The characters portrayed here are homogenized to the point that you find the same story repeating itself, over and over.  It just became boring after a while.  Read the first two or three chapters and enjoy.  From there, proceed with caution 
 First off I don't care that they signed with G-Unit I could give a f**k. It is just there lyrics are getting weaker. Putting 50 on the tracks don't really help anything. They along with the rest of the crew talk about the same subjects things they got, money and hoes. Man rap has gotten dipressing. The second problem I have is P's verse on Pearly Gates, I am religous and I think it's retarted to be talking down on anyones religion. I won't hold these against him because he just speakin his mind but it is still wrong to be talkin like that. 2/5 Only real good track is Put Em In They Place. 
 I am undaunted by the rest of the positive reviews.  Did no one notice that the last and longest story by Camille Anthony was left unfinished?  Who wants to read a short story that requires you to read another book to prepare you for the events in the story, a dictionary to understand it and another book to find out what happens.  Not to mention that these are all repeats and can be found in ebooks.  I'd like to know before I spend more than $10 whether the stories are fresh or not and whether they are complete in themselves. The first two stories were enjoyable enough but so short that I would never have purchased this book if I had known about the last one.  Do yourself a favor and save enough for a nice lunch and borrow this from someone stupid enough to buy it.  Come to think of it you can have mine!!!     
 I have no problem with 'difficult fiction.'  My two favorite authors are Thomas Pynchon and David Foster Wallace.  I tend to gravitate back to "Gravity's Rainbow" over and over because every time I re-read it I find something new.  I have only thrown a book against a wall twice in my life.  The first time was when I read the "Lena" chapter in Stephen R. Donaldson's "Chronicles of Thomas Covenant vol 1" (I did however continue reading that book and ended up enjoying it), and the second time was when i finished the first chapter of this book by Rick Moody.  The opening with the endless and endless and endless list of the sun sweeping across the world was bad enough, but following that with a chapter about a woman with the backdoor trots?  I didn't have a problem with the subject matter (I also happen to love reading hard core horror fiction-- Ed Lee, Jack Ketchum, etc) but it was just too much of a bad thing.  I intend on picking up another of Moody's books and having a crack at it.  I'll just make sure I check it out from the library, which, luckily, I did with "The Diviners. 
 Unfortunately there are not much words to loose. Poor writing together with the fact that practically all facts were lifted from Cameron's 'Conversation with Wilder' which is highly recommended btw, make this book forgettable. Why going through the whole exercise of publishing it is quite a mystery 
 John Updike's literary criticism is perceptive and sparely written - every one of his non-fiction collections is worth reading.  But his novels have, from the very first, been precious, over-written and stifling in their desperate need for approbation.  When he writes fiction, he's like a dog doing tricks for reward.  And certainly, the rewards have come.  But for readers outside the US at least, it's all a little mystifying.  John Cheever was a far better writer, yet his work seems somehow to be regarded by Americans as the lesser canon.  Time will correct this mistake, no doubt, but in the meantime Updike pours out ever more cloying and over-heated work like this.  If I still have your attention, let me recommend the 'Collected Stories' of John Cheever.  Updike could only dream of writing prose like that.  
 I found this book to be offensive.  On page 2, the author acknowledges the language differences of the process (toilet training vs. toilet learning).  As a reader, I understood her position and was comfortable to progress onto further pages.  As I continued reading, I was content with the author's writing until I accessed Chapter 4, where she discusses the positions of experts and references some of their works.  On page 47, she references the controversial book of "Toilet Training in Less Than a Day," by Nathan Azrin, Ph.D. and Richard Foxx, Ph.D. and that their "program was devised not for speed, but to help the retarded learn this difficult skill."  I think the term "mentally challenged" or "developmentally challenged" would have been more appropriate.  In spite of my shock that someone would write a book and refer to those with special needs as "retarded", I continued on until I accessed Chapter 6, "How Can I Train My Child Under Special Circumstances?"  Under the section "Using Public Restrooms Alone", the author discusses what she considers "supervised" use of facilities.  She states that a parent can stand outside the door while the child uses the facilities alone.  She states that a parent can "ask an appropriate-looking man to take the boy into the restroom while you wait outside the door. (Same for situations with girls, Dad.)" and to "only let a child alone to one that is in shouting distance or in view."  In a world where pedophiles are lurking in such areas and seize those moments when a child is alone to harm them, I find that advice to be completely irresponsible.  At that point, I could no longer continue reading this book and take advice from someone who would make such irresponsible suggestions.  I would rather have my child in diapers for the rest of her life!  Over 275,000 copies sold -- I wonder how many of those were returned, as mine was 
 Saw this one on television.   Vincent van Gogh was misfortunate in life and certainly crazy. The artist who portrays him does his job very well.  The scenery is breathtaking.  However the nudity  in the film is vulgar. The chaeracters are hard to identify with. Some of the scenes are disgusting.   Not going to see this one again 
 This will be less of a formal review and more of a personal take, more or less. Due to the fact I've read several intro books, as well as the primary source material, i have a well-informed frame of reference in the judgment of this book's merits.  Not long ago I said the following: Russell's A History of Western Philosophy? Patooey! The all time worst intro book i've ever read!  Granted, HWP is witty, no doubt. This is probably the book's only redeeming value, meriting it a star. Scattered throughout are gems like: "I would rather be reported by my bitterest enemy among philosophers than a friend innocent of philosophy."   On the other hand.... HWP is overrated, underwhelming, and embarrassingly inept for many reasons.  Overrated? The inadequacy and shallowness of most interpretations of the other philosophers' works is the biggest factor. Worst of all, the flippant comments are amusing, which provide entertainment in a conversation, but are utterly out of place when introducing a serious work. However, Russell's take on Leibniz is reliable, because he did his homework, occasionally.  Underwhelming? Russell, like a well trained 'whiggish', kneels deeply before the altar of John Locke, supposedly the champion of the 'modern liberal republican.' Despite admitting that Locke is an inferior philosopher to Spinoza, the godfather gets more press. Instead of philosophy in the HWP, we get self-serving propaganda.  Inept? Not once does Russell ever truly take a problem seriously. IThe complete failure to understand Kant, the philosopher of the enlightenment, as well as Schopenhauer (skipping the World as Will and Representation is not a good idea, Bertie) is a huge let-down. Predictably, he reads Nietzsche as a fascist (exposes his shoddy scholarship by linking him to Nazi socialism), whiffs on Dewey's brand of pragmatism, and for reasons unknown, devotes a chapter on Byron. More bizarre is the excessive attention paid to Catholic philosophy. I don't think the biographer Ray Monk even figured this out, either. Contemporaries like G.E. Moore gets a single mention and Wittgenstein, who he greatly respected, none.  Quite telling, Russell was shocked at the book's success - he produced it casually, intended it as a potboiler, compiled from the notes for the adult education classes he taught in the United States.  Conclusion: The shallowness, due to its intent to amuse, the odd bulk of space devoted to Christian philosophy, all combine to account for world-wide success for The History of Western Philosophy. It might be a good starter, but it also contributes to the sense that philosophy is not worth bothering with.   Alternatives: Copleston's series is lengthy, but thorough, and far superior. You can't go wrong with Durant's Story of Philosophy, although it is a bit dated. Luckily, Durant writes as well as any writer in English, making that book much more accessible to most. T. Z. Lavine's From Socrates to Sartre concentrates on much fewer big-names, but has a lively narrative that sensationalizes the content.  After you've read any one of these, then try Bryan Magee's books: Great Philosophers and Talking Philosophy where both consists of interviews with scholars. As for a contemporary account, Delacampagne's A History of Philosophy in the 20th century is a delicious read 
 But close.  I was stuck in a snow storm in the mountains of eastern California and was able to get to a movie store.  Bad choice.  I liked shovelling snow quite a bit better actually 
 I first read Clavell's Shogun when I was twelve years and it sparked within me a life long interest in East-Asian culture. In many ways he helped bring me to Japan, where I have lived for a total of eight years. However after reading his works for many years, I was quite bored with Gaijin, which I never finished. I perused through the book looking for interesting points but found little. His messages in his other works were repetitive in this one. Amongst them are his criticisms of western culture through an Asian perspective. I grew tired of hearing how sexually repressed white-anglo-saxon-protestants are when compared to their Asian counter-parts, and thought my reading time was too precious to sit through another lengthy reading of how East meets West. Some of my friends in Japan have read Gaijin and liked it; but after owing so much to this writer, I am sorry that I could not say more of this work. 
 I didn't even finish the book.  By the end of the first chapter I was disgusted by the completely one-sided portrayal of women, particularly minority women, as abject victims of white men.  I agree that this book has its roots in truth, but I think that a more evenly assessed account could certainly have been written.  I didn't like the attitude of the author.  She seems to think that black women were the only ones who suffered.  What about black males?  Or white women?  Or Native Americans?  Just because I didn't see them in the first chapter doesn't mean they aren't discussed at all, but it didn't set the right tone for me 
 Cannot remember a reading a worse book.  Boring, uninteresting story, repetitive dialogue.  The only good think about it is that it is very short 
 I am a huge fan of the books and had been very excited to see this film when it came out. Unfortunately, I was horribly disappointed.   The acting was terrible, elements of the story were changed (I know, it can't be 100% true to the book, but this was a massacre), and the characters were ruined (c'mon, they made the movie version Mr. Tumnus seem just a tad bit...um...creepy). They turned Aslan into nothing more than a poorly animated talking lion.   Seriously, go read the books and don't waste your time on this film. 
 This book is a rip-off. There is no new information in it. It purports to give unique insights, when all it does is rehash conventional wisdom. 
 This movie does not make sense. And it's not weird in the style of David Lynch, it's just complete crap. I thought Willie Wonka and The Chocolate Factory was the worst/stupidest fil ever until i saw this. Do not buy this. It is not a family movie, and it is not funny or entertaining 
 This is a great movie with a mistaken rating.  If your three year old is enjoying this movie, please re-think what you show your children.  REALLY 
 We like to believe, in these enlightened times, that reason and science are all that matter.  This, though, is simply not true.  Words, thoughts, ideas, and images creep into one's mind insideously and, with each one, corrupts the essential self we desperately cling to.  You think you are safe, there in front of your computer screen, reading this. You're not.  In fact, it is already too late for you.  You've been caught, infected, by an idea, a forbidden thought, that pulls you inexorably toward a knowing that most run from, screaming.  You can't know, now, who or what you will become as a result of this, but know with perfect certainty that the you you are now will be gone, replaced forever with some other you, a you you don't even know.  It starts in your mind, moves into your brain, then into your body, then into the whole universe.  It is simply too late.  You'd better read this book after all, otherwise you're screwed 
 As I'm more than halfway through this book I might as well finish. Julie's less than amusing encounters with lobster slaughter, for example, are rendered with just enough humor to make her tales palatable. I'd forgotten how unbelievably disgusting a great many of Julia's Child's recipes were until slogging my way through the diary version of Julie's life with Julia from hoof to flailing claw to beaten lettuce. A slight exaggeration, but not by  much.  Proof that the human species hasn't advanced all that far on a culinary level, if we're supposed to be amused by all this. 
 This is something that any first year business student could have written. It is a fast read but it provides no new insights 
 This pen keeps falling apart.  Also, it is difficult to use the recording part because you have to almost shout to record anything.  I am sorry I  bought it 
 It is difficult to give this book a critical look because it has become as unquestioned as the Bible is in certain circles.  According to the author the Vietnamese are unknown and unknowable to westerners. (Somehow she has grasped their elemental essence.) They share so little in common with the rest of humanity that Stalinist communism is the only political system under which they will prosper and be true to their anthropological roots.  "The moment has arrived for the narrow flame of revolution to cleanse the lake of Vietnamese society from the corruption and disorder of the American war.  It will have to come, for it is the only way the Vietnamese of the south can restore their country and their history to themselves."  As it has been seen by the eyes of the world through the history of Southeast Asia since 1975 the South Vietnamese were truly fortunate to have been "liberated" and "brought back to their heritage" by a force as truly benevolent and peaceful as the government of the "Democratic Republic of Vietnam."  Overly academic in an elitist anti-anticommunist way, this book has been required reading in all "revisionist" undergraduate history seminars and lectures since its first publication in 1972. (What was "revisionist" in the 1970s is the Very Truth in 2005.) It has the obligitory academic but irrelevant references to "dead white men" (Shakespeare's Tempest) for mostly incomprehensible reasons.  As I watch the people of Vietnam being pimped by their government to enrich its coffers and those of the Nike Corporation, I think of how stupid, ignorant and ultimately vile this book is and was.  As I watch the diaspora of Vietnam succeed and prosper I wonder how Frances Fitzgerald can sleep for all of their brothers and sisters left behind in that unfortunate and misjudged land. For all of its damage done it is regrettable that this book was not the end of Frances Fitzgerald's career, but its beginning 
 Unable to get a message to Amazon any other way.  The last two cds are bad, can't play them on my cd player.  I have sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure, but no one has contacted me.  Very disappointed in the Customer relations of this cd compan 
 This coffee maker is not up to the usual Krups standard.  The latch to open the coffee filter doesn't always work.  Everything on this machine looks and feels cheap-plastic.  Also, why does Krups require you to purchase a new permanent filter with every purchase?  Older model filters never fit in the newer models.  If you fill the water even slightly over the 10 cup line (yes the instructions tell you not to) you WILL burn yourself when you take the pot out.  The hot coffee will run right over the top of the carafe and onto the handle.  I was always a loyal Krups customer, but will rethink my position on that when making my next appliance purchase 
 I am amazed that all these so-called health foods will add artery-clogging "palm kernel oil" as an ingredient.  Don't buy anything with palm kernel oil, cocoa butter, and anything hydrogenated!!  No matter how many "organic" things are added to it.  For many years now, it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease.  The World Health Organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases. 
 Osborne and Gaebler's ideas have been around a long time; don't be misled into thinking this is something new.  Particularly objectionable is their use of phrases such as "sluggish pace of bureaucracy" which is  designed to feed into the reader's own stereotype.  The book feeds upon the  fear of the reader, and therefore does not offer much in the way of  scholarly reading.  One would do better to read some Herbert Simon or  Charles Goodsell before embarking on this journey 
 Sorry to say this two-pack is not up to History Channel usual high standard. DVD 1, on the Spartans (essentially leading up to Thermopylae) is good. However, DVD 2 is very disappointing. First of all, it has three documentaires, but in fact the first one ("The Odyssey of Troy") and the third one ("The Trojan City") are carbon copies of each other, which is somewhat of a fraud... Second, the information given by the historians is good, but the narrative itself is more than misleading -- it leaves the viewer with the impression that the Trojan Horse epic is part of Homer's Iliad. It isn't. Homer finishes the Iliad with the burial of Hector. It is in a "sequel" so to say, by Quintus of Smyrna, written many centuries later, that the story of the Trojan Horse is set down. It is also mentioned in other less complete writings, but certainly not in Homer.  To be fair, the second documentary in DVD 2 ("The Ancient Gold of Troy") is not bad, but does not correct the errors in the other "two" segements 
 This book is terrible.  It is very hard to understand.  Not recommended 
 This was definitely a let-down after "Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight", which I thoroughly enjoyed. I found "Scribbling" to be rambling and without purpose at times. It seems unfinished and incomplete.  
  I couldn't even begin to count all the things Stanley Coren gets wrong in THE INTELLIGENCE OF DOGS.  For instance, in one section he claims that dogs have the ability to do math but in another part of the book he claims they can't tell the difference between a tug toy and human skin.  The first is clearly way beyond a dog's capacity, while the second is something which comes totally natural to them.  How did Coren get things so backwards?  And the "intelligence" tests he provides have nothing to do with intelligence but in how focused or driven a dog is to do the test (or game) while you're doing it.  For instance, I tried one of the tests with my dog by putting a piece of food under a towel, then waited to see how long it took him to find the treat.  I'd still be waiting if I hadn't decided he'd never look under that towel.  Then I tried the same game by teasing my dog with one of his favorite toys.  Then I hid it under the towel, and it took him less than a second to get that toy.  So my dog is apparently both on the smarter and dumber ends of Coren's intelligence spectrum.  (This is just one example, by the way: the whole idea of testing a dog's IQ like this is bogus.)  And don't get me started on Coren's pedantic retelling of the alpha myth.  Granted, he wrote this book before the latest research on wild wolf packs proved that there's no such thing as a dominance hierarchy, or an alpha wolf, or the rest of that alpha nonsense.  Though, I doubt if even that data would change Coren's mind.  After all, he seriously recommends rolling your dog over on its back every day and pulling one of the animal's hind legs in the air to create a posture which supposedly "signifies submission to the pack leader."  (Really?  Dogs use "signifiers" now?)  The funny thing is, shortly after reading that passage I saw a wolf documentary on TV and the papa wolf did the exact opposite or what Coren recommends!  He rolled over on HIS back and let the pups jump on top of him and bite his nose!  They loved it!  So I tried what the papa wolf did with his pups with my dog--an alpha male, if there ever was one--and HE loved it.  And later that night, on our last walk, he was ten times as obedient to me than he had been before I'd mimicked the papa wolf's behavior.  Again, Coren had everything exactly backwards to reality.   This "through the looking glass" quality persists throughout the book, with Coren even saying that dogs are capable of hypothetical, symbolic, and conceptual thinking.  Wha..?  I'm sorry.  I love dogs and I think they have wonderful abilities that should be honored and respected, but the abilities they DO have are geared for being a dog, not a mini-me with four legs and a tail.  For one thing, fully one third of a dog's brain is devoted to processing olfactory information, and none to processing symbols and concepts.  I think Coren needs to do a little more research on comparative neuroanatomy and actual wolf behavior before he makes more ridiculous claims like the ones he made in this inane book. 
 Apparently the difference between a criminal act (theft) and moral redistribution of income is 1) who you steal from (stealing from the wealthy, of course, is moral -- according to Rawls and Bolsheviks), and 2) who receives the loot (the non-wealthy makes it moral), and 3) who commits the act (the state/society, of course also makes theft moral; example - taxation), and 4) your intentions (redistribution of income). To look at this another way, if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money, that's a crime (unless your neighbor is poor -- which would then be moral and Justice, according to Rawls' formula). If the community comes into your house and steals from you, it's legal and moral Justice, again, according to Rawls. Because, according to Rawls, if, before you were born, you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured, you'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal, or they would be compensated somehow for being born (unjustly) less-equal. How? By compensating those with less by stealing from those with more. So those with more would be like oh, say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less. So those with more would become a resource, or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because "society" (the Robin Hoods and Rawls of the world) deemed this as moral Justice. Rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk, entrepreneurs, students of life who work to earn an "A" vs. students who earn an "F". He points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own. True. But that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause, nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference. Forcing the "wealthier" ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill isn't Justice or moral. It would simply be an unjust law. Some people see Rawls' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia (like the Bolsheviks envisioned Marxism). I see it as an insane blueprint for slavery, and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit. In a sense, this book is an argument against the individual. It sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people -- he doesn't recognize any individuals (unless they were born as victims). Curious. How do you experience life ... as a group-mind (an oxymoron if there ever was one), a collective? Or as a unique, isolated, independent, individual? There should be societal incentives to help each other. Okay. But when it is forced (theft of property always implies force), it is no longer an issue of morality or justice -- it's simply a law. Without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue, by definition. Transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom?   
 I was looking for something more detailed on different laws that someone in HR should know.  I felt this book was too broad and the way it was written was a little hard to read.  If you are a business owner trying to get the basic "dos and don'ts" this may work, otherwise I would look elsewhere 
 Very complicated book. Bad examples and format. AN FYI for college students trying to save money, the older edition is the SAME as the newest one. What a rip off. 
 I will admit that the text is not bad.  There is some good advice on every aspect of photographing children.  However, what is bad about this book is that the photographs are just horrible.  Compositions are poor, lighting is poor, focus is poor.  If you are looking to learn a lot about photographing children, you really won't from this book 
 An awful yawner.  It shows all the reasons chivalry made for tiresome tales, and why the world needed Don Quixote so badly.  The Chretien de Troyes version of Lancelot is repetitious, has many loose ends, and is full of plot holes.  Lancelot jumps into a cart to shame himself in pursuit of Guenivere.  Before Lancelot jumps into the cart, the narrator states that "reason is the enemy of love."  In the scope of the book, and the code of chivalry, reason is the enemy of this genre.  Take with Nyquil. 
 Let me start by saying that I know firsthand how hard it is to pull off a believable thriller. I wrote "Process of Elimination" - a complicated story about a private investigator who becomes entangled in a political murder conspiracy. I worked hard to make the story both fun and smart - things I enjoy in a book. Of course their are also hefty doses of realistic combat, sex, and engaging characters. If interested, you can find "Process of Elimination" on Amazon. End of my shameless plug -- on with the review.  In the past, I have enjoyed Patterson's works - most especially those featuring Alex Cross. The stories are entertaining, but I think what I like most is his character development. As readers, we feel like we know Alex, Nana, and the whole peanut butter eating clan. The good news is that Patterson keeps us right "in the family" with 4 Blind Mice. The bad news is that he's lost something in this latest book... believable storytelling.   The story starts off with the brutal murder of some women. An army sergeant is convicted of their murder. The evidence seems overwhelming - DNA, murder weapon, witnesses. He calls in Sampson to help clear his name before they put him to death for a crime he didn't commit. So in my opinion, the story gets a good start. But from that point on, well, it just gets stupid. I laughed as I read the story, and I don't think Patterson meant for it to be so outlandish that it was funny.  What's wrong with the story? Let's start with just how quickly they put Sampson's buddy to death. He's convicted, and wham bang, he's dead. Uh -- yeah, sure it works like that. Then there's the impossible murder scenes. Let's see, three grown men rush into houses, brutally slaughter the inhabitants, then paint their faces or bodies. Yet no neighbor sees or hears a thing. No physical evidence is left at the scenes (not even bloody footprints). Everything goes impossibly perfect for the murderers. And not just once, but over and over. In fact they kill police, prostitutes, hikers, you name it. Not only do they kill them, but they create stooges to go down for the perfect murders. And no one ever finds a drop of evidence? Hmm...    Fortunately, to complement the world's luckiest set of bad guys is the world's dummest detectives. Cross and Sampson actually discover who the murderers are through someone else's help - they can't do it on their own. They then go and cause trouble with them, why I'm not quite sure. They then go back home and go shopping for groceries. It's like they think that the murderers aren't willing to hop a flight and come find them. I would think if you're rousting a group of brutal murderers, you might actually take a few precautions. When they finally do have the "big shootout," Cross and Sampson use their tiny intellects to rush into the cabin, guns a blazing. Of course they don't hit anyone -- both need more target practice I think. There is way too much galantry and not enough thinking going on here.  Don't get me wrong, the whole book was entertaining and fast paced. But more so as a satire of a real police thriller. If you need a good laugh, pick this one up. If you're looking for something more intelligent or serious, definitely look elsewhere. 
 The headband on these headphones is a fixed size, so they are held in place by the pressure of the earpads against your ears. They were uncomfortable after 5 seconds, so I can't imagine wearing them for any significant length of time. I'm not sure what they were thinking - one size fits all is not a good idea for headphones 
 I was expecting a bit more from a book calling itself an "Essential Guide".  The whole book is basically a collection of 15 documents taken from sources like the US state department and the IRS.  They cover taxation, emigration, what to do if you get arrested and a bunch of other legalistic things relating to being abroad.  Unfortunately, that's all it has: the documents.  There is no commentary, so you're left reading government documents that are written like stereo instructions.  About 60 of the 160 or so pages are tax instructions...basically reprints of the expat equivalent of 1040 instructions.  While I haven't checked, these seem like the kind of documents that a) change relatively often and b) can be obtained for free if you need them.   Bottom line:  This is a good book to have on the shelf as a reference you hope to never have to use.  As for providing you with a practical guide to living and working overseas, try something like the Expert Expatriate 
 Only "Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe" survives....  Judy overplays and the only thing worth mentioning besides the titlesegment is Virginia O`Brien...   To me - this film doesn`t exist in my collection of Judy Garland items.. 
 Once I finished reading this book, Robert W Smith made a really terrible impression as both an individual, a writer and a martial artist. He writes and communicates in an arrogant and conceted manner. However his book on Baguazhang was a lot better. This book is a waste of money, though you will find out what one American thinks, if that is what you want. His attitudes about chinese martial arts on Taiwan and on China are biased. He just seems to really dislike China.  
 If people understood the principles of reinforcement and punishment, there should be no surprise that people can be taught new behaviors in a short amount of time.  The more important thing is how to change these innapropriate behaviors on a large scale 
 I love Lee.  I mean his stuff is just so much fun.  When I finally gave him a chance and started reading his stuff I was hooked.  Then I read Flesh Gothic and while good it just was not quite as good as the others I had read.  I could not call what I felt disappointment but it was like a bump in the road.  Then I read the Messenger.  This is the worst I have read from Lee.  It contained none of the fun of his other novels.  Stay away from this one.  
 This film is beautifully acted by Kevin Spacey, but far too dark and gloomy for comfortable viewing.  It may indeed depict what the writer thought of the film world, but why inflict this depiction on the world I ask.  The story is cynical, cruel and I found the last half of the film very uncomfortable to watch.  Not a favourite 
 I am a big Brian Setzer fan going back to the Stray Cats. He quite frankly is one of the few artists out there whose music is just fun, lively, and makes you feel "Hey man, this is music". Setzer is as talented on the guitar as Jerry Lee Lewis is on the piano and in my mind no better compliment can be paid to a musician.   Every new iteration of Brian Setzer has been enjoyable: Stray cats, to the Swing of the Dirty Boogie, to the Rockabilly of the Comeback Special, and the superb tribute to sun records.  But, he missed it on this CD. The song writing is silly and sophmoric. I do not expect to find the meaning of life hidden behind the lyrics found in Setzer's CDs but the majority of songs on this CD have all the same elements. Some songs are riddled with rhymes children in the first grade use, and are repeated endlessly. Such as in the song "Bad Bad Girl in a Bad Bad World".   For example here is a small snippet out of the song mentioned before:   She's a bad bad girl in a bad bad world A bad bad girl in a bad bad world It's not her fault she's a bad bad world It's so sad it's a sad sad world She's a bad bad girl in a bad bad world A bad bad girl in a bad bad world It's not her fault she's a bad bad world She's a bad bad, bad bad, bad bad, bad bad girl  What garbage! By the end of the little chorus you just want to give the CD a toss.  Many of his songs are riddled with the disjointed tempo changes found in punk music. Setzer has been able to do this subtly in the past without calling attention to it, but there are a few songs on here that just sound confused. Definately not a Setzer trait.   There has never been a Setzer song that I absolutely cannot stand, until "Really Rockabilly" and "Bad Bad Girl". The first two bad songs he has done on the same disc. There is not one single song on here that compares favorably with any other of his songs that have come before.   I have to mention that I hold Setzer to a very high standard, which until now he has never fallen short of. This CD is still far better than 95% of the crap that is being released in today's market.  To summarize I would encourage Setzer to get beyond this CD, and return to his thrown a top the music landscape 
 the supplier sent me a second rate product. I expected a beautiful clean cut hardcover book to keep for ever... but instead i got a book that bad oddly cut pages. I am very annoyed and hope that the supplier sends books that are of good quality. the books is defineatly going to be a superd read.. but i wish that the seller sells quality produts. i am pissed 
 This movie was AWESOME!  Ben Stiller is a comic GENIUS, he's the new Jerry Lewis!  DeNiro, AWESOME!  Hoffman, AWESOME!  Streisand, AWESOME and still very sexy for an old liberal ho!  I thought the sight gags were priceless, and the plot line serene!  This was Hollywood movie watching heaven!  This film should have won some Academy Awards!  I mean if Marisa Torme can win for My Cousin Vinnie, these A-1 actors should've at least been nominated!  This is a highly entertaining film, and I recommend it to every and anyone to see, but wear your Depends, because you might pee yourself from laughing so hard!  Dubya 99, you don't know what in the FRIGGIN' H E L L you're talking about!  Yeah like we're suppose to take the opinion of an anti-social loser, that complains about going out to the movies?  Stay home, I'm sure Dateline NBC will be calling soon about that episode they had recently 
 One of the plate I bought broken during a 50 seconds medium heat  microwaving, so I doubt it is really good for microwave. When I called Lenox, their rep. simply asked if I want to order a replacement from them as if the bad quality was not their problem. Disguesting. The design pattern was nice though 
 I bought one of these because I thought it would make it easier to brew fresh ground coffee.  The beans are ground in a chamber with screen walls and then the coffee is brewed by dripping water right through the grinding chamber.  This works surprisingly well and is easy to clean since you can remove the grinding chamber and rinse it out in the sink.  The problem I had is that the the bottom and sides of the brewing chamber are all mesh so water ran through the beans to quickly making a weak cup of coffee.  Adding more coffee produced stronger coffee but it wasn't as full-flavored as a cup brewed through a paper filter in a standard coffee maker.  I ended ditching this product and going back to a standard coffee maker and a stand alone grinder.  If you like the complex flavors of a strong cup of coffee you'll probably end up doing the same 
 I love this movie! It is so incredibly stupid and funny. It is absolutely ridiculous and slightly crass. The grinch and the whos look like a bunch of clowns. The film was predictable and completely ripped off from the animated TV special. This isn't as stupid as Barney, because at least the makers of this film actually tried to be funny, rather than just childish and retarded. This film has gotten a lot of mixed reviews on amazon.com, so be sure to rent it before you buy it. 
 I use this text for an AP Computer Science course, and find it to be one of the most confusing books on the topiic of Java and Computer Science. Being in multiple APs, I obvisouly cannot read every single word and frequently have to sort out what information is relevant in a book. In most of my textbooks, this is rather easy. Horstmann's book is, however, quite the exception. The authos literally interupts his own sentences and sections with dozens of "Random facts," "Productivity Hints," "Advanced Topics," and many more of these litte interuptions. One chapter, I forget which one, actually has three of these strung in a row, manking this book incredibly hard to read. After cutting out in the middle of a topic, it is very common to just, without warning, start back up five pages later. Avoid this book 
 On page 103 Miller refers to the income tax on social security benefits and states: "starting in 1993 these benefits were taxed".   We know who was in office in 1993 however Miller is wrong.  The tax was imposed in 1983 and went into effect in 1984 as part of the Reagan Revolution.   Millers conservatives have had several years to repeal this onerous tax on the retirees of America and chose not to. They cut the tax for the wealthy but left it in place for those on pensions.  Senator Moynihan said it best: "Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but not their own facts".  It seems to me he should have known this.  Those of us who have to pay it and are hurt by it know it all too well, I guess those who are real wealthy don't notice it at all.  I don't think Bob Dole misses the extra tax on his ss income as much as the widow with retirement income of 25k.  I have to wonder if anyone even proof reads these political books that are churned out en masse.  
 Boring, derivative and very mildly amusing. Almodovar did it all before-and much better 20 years ago! I couldn't ever watch it for more than 30 minutes. The only positive comment I have is that the movie shows a more polished and upscale side of Mexico and not the usual slums and sordid lives that seems to be so typical in Mexican movies, at least those imported in the USA. 
 The author makes strong statements without proving them. His arguments are easily refutable, his "data" yields itself better to different and much more humanistic interpretations.  Don't waste you time and money, unless you are a female chauvinist trying to boost your self-confidence by any means 
 I am a fan of Dan Poyter's, and I have learned a lot from this author's monumental work, "The Self-Publishing Manual". I thought this title, "Writing Nonfiction : Turning Thoughts into Books", is another one of such great works. I was so disappointed while reading this book when I realized that it was nothing but a rehash of the original book. I just could not understand how a professional author could have the audacity to publish the same book under two different titles and sell both to the same audience. I don't know if you get, I just don't. To make matters worse, this title is not as detailed as the original work. So, if you are interested in learning from this man, I suggest that you get a copy of "The Self-Publishing Manual", rather than this one. I gave this book 1 star, not because it does not contain useful information, but because it contains nothing new from the author's previous publication. It is really unfortunate. I felt cheated. 
 I bought this book for .25 cents at a yard sale. Boy did I waste my quarter!   I found NO new meditation techniques in this little rag. It is clear to understand why the sales ranking of this book is only 608,394.   This is your basic, "You know the envision white light garbage and hold your breath to the count of ......". You know the same junk that all charlatons teach.  This book is pitiful at best. 
 If you are afraid that sociopaths are learning effective ways to kill ,then this book will put your fears to rest. One of Minnery's suggestions is to find out what hotel room your target is staying in. Then rent two  hospital X-ray machines and position them in the two rooms adjacent to the  target's room. Aim them through the walls at his bed and crank them on. The  target will die of leukemia. The only practical method in his entire How To  Kill series was Hatchet To The Medulla. If these books were required  reading for every would-be killer in America the homicide rate would drop  considerably 
 When I first read the synopsis of this book, I thought that it would be an interesting read.  After the first 20 or so pages I was not sure what I had gotten myself into.  The writing style seemed awkward and the phrase "I'd like to know" came up so often it became extremely annoying and at times out of place. Writing style aside, the premise of this book was very similar to the movie and series "Stargate" but less interesting and more confusing.  The book itself seemed to be a mishmash of different stories and ideas.  The book never seemed to flow.  Sometimes the story went quickly and the reader was left trying to figure out what was going on.  The author created situations without any explanation and many times I was left to wonder "how did that happen?"  In other sections of the book, the author seemed to drag on forever.  The longest subplot in the book seemed to be an odd take on Slavery in American and Colonial History.  It seemed out of place and more of a rant on black and white culture and relations.   This book was so odd that I never could figure out what the author was trying to accomplish in writing this book.  Of course, Williamson did leave an open ended ending which leads me to believe he was thinking of writing other books about the different subplots he created.  In the end, who knows?  All I know is that after reading this story I am not inclined to purchase another book from this author.   
 So annoying to be told again and again how the British treat dogs better than the locals... and all the rest! Even complaining about the food he gets (for free). I would like one day to walk up to his house in Scotland, smelly and with a mangy dog, and see what kind of food I get 
 I debated whether or not I should write a review.  After all, I only read the first 70 pages or so, after which I decided to stop slogging through this tedious novel.  However, since I assume most people who would buy and read this book are doing it for their own enjoyment, I felt complelled to chime in, although I'm clearly in the minority.  However, I must add in my defense that this book was initially criticized by his contemporaries as a short story that just kept rambling on with no apparent purpose, a criticism I find valid.  The premise sounds fascinating - the journey of a young seaman who attempts to reconcile his dishonorable past.  It sounded like it would be an interesting tale about the conflict between heroics and harsh reality.  However, in the delivery of the story, I lost all interest shortly.  The main problem I see is in the vivid descriptions and imagery.  This, or course, is usually a good thing.  However, Conrad seems to go into such great description of every little detail that it distracts from the main story.  It seems that Conrad could have been just as effective by using half of the words.  The non-sequitur narrative also makes it a bit more difficult to follow, although I think this could have been effective if the narrative would have been more concise and to the point.  However, rather than merely blasting away at "Lord Jim," I will at least give one alternative - "Heart of Darkness", also by Joseph Conrad.  Read my take of this in my other reviews.  This is a much more interesting and more enjoyable read than "Lord Jim", and about half its length.  Plus, it offers a more poignant picture of Imperialism and its ideals (or lack thereof).  Perhaps I will give it another go in the future, but until then I would recommend you give "Lord Jim" a pass and spend your money and time on another novel, perhaps "Heart of Darkness. 
 This book is well written by a woman who would know a lot about advances and pick ups. However, her book really only scratches the surface of learning to date out of your league. Yes she tells you how to dress, yes she tells you how to eat properly, and yes she even tells you how to be a VIP (All very interesting and good tips by the way) But what made this book unhelpful was the lack of content. You cannot only tell a man to dress well and act wealthy but you must give him content! tell him what to say! tell him what to do! tell him what won't work! The Author goes in depth into each sign of interest a woman can show, but if a man cannot even be interesting in conversation why would a woman ever show interest? If your looking for a book to tell you how to dress like Sean Connery and become a VIP at your local restuarant then buy this book. But if your looking for a book that will teach you how to talk to woman, tell funny stories, and get them interested in you I recommend you look elsewhere 
 When I first discovered the Stephanie Plum series (I started with Four to Score, then backtracked), I was delighted with the character of Stephanie Plum.  Although she was down on her luck, she was plucky, endearing, and canny enough to make the best of any situation she encountered.  In earlier books, Stephanie was kind to her family and friends even though they drove her crazy, held her own in her on again/off again relationship with boyfriend cop Joe Morelli, and walked a fine line during her curious encounters with Ranger.  She even showed some attitude with her smarmy cousin Vinnie, her ex-husband, and her nemesis Joyce Barnhardt.  But now, Stephanie Plum has morphed into someone who is selfish, stubborn and just plain stupid.  She has develped a childish mean streak and displays little regard for anyone but herself.    In Ten Big Ones, Stephanie is stalked by a gang hit man and, being the intrepid bounty hunter that she is, Stephanie walks right into the eye of the storm.  Deciding that Joe's concern for her safety is too oppressive, she moves out of his house and into Ranger's unoccupied apartment.  In one of her silliest schemes yet, she wrangles Lula and Connie into helping her kidnap a gang member, putting them all in jeopardy.  And as her sister's nuptuals approach, Stephanie becomes more and more obnoxious.  All this is played for laughs, but it misses the mark.  The plot is deja vu, the characters predictable.  Sadly, the loveable characters created long ago by Evanovich are now stuck in a time warp where they never grow up, never change and they go through similar events again and again.  Come on, bring back the old Stephanie and give Morelli something to do other than walk his dog Bob and answer his cell phone.  I'm taking a vacation from this series.  Bring on James Patterson, Laurie King, Lisa Gardner... 
 I think if you've lived life under a rock, watched a lot of soap operas, and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas, this book will appeal to you.    It makes me angry to read this book; not because it's fiction (and I'll call it completely fictitious garbage), but because James Frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction!  He writes this book with an underlying tone "I'm better than all of you."  Not because he thinks AA is BS, but because this theme runs throughout his book, in so many situations, that after awhile it becomes laughable!  He prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain a-hole, except his tough guy "friends."  I ask you, if Leonard has such a reputation... where's his protection?  People would be after him in such a vulnerable (read: no security) place like rehab.     I think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its BS by feeling its predictability.  It reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people, yeah, he's got problems, but he'll prevail because he's James Frey!  No thank you.  I absolutely hated this book, but I read it so I at least deserve credit for trying. 
 Uptight girl from Harvard Med School travels with her boyfriend to LA to stay at his Mom's house and while there faces the temptations resulting from exposure to West Coast free-spirited pot smoking types. Almost destroys relationship. Sound trite? It is. Characters lack depth with the exception of the Mom played by Frances McDormand and the ultimately the film takes itself way too seriously 
 I have the VHS tape of this movie & will continue to own it while this Goodtimes version of this great movie is on the shelf.  I have not watched this movie for the fact that Goodtimes will screw up a good movie with bad quality picture, sound, & all around basics.  The movie itself is great to watch with Weller & Elliott in the action scenes & the story is just all in your face.  The only problem is this movie was not released by MCA Home Video, if it had been you would have a great movie on DVD instead of this blurred & muffled sound version 
 This movie is so bad. It is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems. The only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character, a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities. The movie tries hard to invent new "teen speak" with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character, Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end, she's like Ella May Clampet going after Jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out. 
 WOW!!!  I used to love these guys when I was in high school and had forgotten about them until recently when I saw this disc in a used bin at a record store.  When I put the disc on I could hardly believe my ears!  The level of musicianship, quality of arrangements, and man oh man, Emanuel Rahiem Leblanc's voice is astounding!!!  I didn't remember what a truly spectacular singer this guy was - an absolute equal of any of the great R&B stars of the 70's or 80's.  To label them a "disco" band only, would be doing a misservice to the group.  Their music skillfully and beautifully fuses soul, funk, doo-wop, and R&B.  I believe it's much more musically substantial than a "disco band" label implies, that's all.   Judging by alot of the feedback here they can apparently still throw down in concert as well.  That's not a surprise.  Listen to the skill all the players in this band possess and you'll see why this band's music is timeless - sounds as good today as 20-30 years ago, and will sound as good 50 years from now.  I sure hope they play Minneapolis soon!! 
 This book is a very poor follow-up of the book "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" by the same authors. "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" presents substanial amounts of opinion and speculation as fact. "Messianic Legacy" does nothing to correct that failure while adding virtually nothing of substance. Some claims the authors make in both books contradict the New Testament without citing remotely reliable sources from the early Christian era 
 Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon head up the cast as a comedy duo from the 50's whose careers are ruined by a scandal involving the murder of a young woman. Bacon does a pretty good job as a creepy funny man, with Firth as the anchor of the team. Off-stage the comedy roles they play are echoed in their lives. But I found "Truth" confusing and unengaging. I found it hard to care at all about the demise of the duo. And as several have noted, Lohman as the reporter who seeks to uncover the mystery of the murder is not credible. Give this one a pass 
 This book is so full of lies, half truths, misquotes, out of context quotes and manipulations that it would even make the devil blush. Actually, simple research will find many blatant lies in all of her books. She uses end notes in her books, but calls them footnotes. Endnotes are much harder to research as compared to footnotes and appear at the end of the book, not at the bottom of the page. I could list each lie, but the review would be pages long, especially when typing out the quotes she uses and the real quotes. Do your own research if you'd like, and I challenge Ann Coulter's fans to research her lies. But I digress, I think that most people who read her books, however, just want to reconfirm what they already believe and will not bother to research inaccuracies. Her most famous style of lying however, is using newspaper quotes out of context, or changing what the person said, or simply just making it up. A simple LexisNexis Search will reveal most of her lies. I found that more than 60% of this book was made up, twisted, or taken out of context, the other 40% was name-calling, insulting broad generalisations,and angry ranting which is, ironically, slander itself. Wow, what a great view of the Republican Right. If I were a Republican, I would NOT be proud to have her on my team. She is juevenile, brash, and most of all, a liar. I hope she fazes out of favor with the American public because she is toxic and an example of what is wrong in American Politics today, despite what side of the fence you sit on. I feel that lying to prove your point and name-calling is poisenous, egregious and morally bankrupt, no matter what political party you belong to. Do yourself a favor, and read a book by another author. If you do choose to read this, I challenge you to look further into what she writes. The lies begin in the first few pages.   
 WHEN I FIRST TIME USED IT,IT'S BORKEN. AND I CAN NOT RETURN OR EXCHANGE WITHOUT BO 
 This cd has nothing that old Moonspell used to have. It's too watered down and artistic. It really seems like they tried a little too hard to be "unique" and ended up being boring. I am pretty dissapointed 
 I'm not impressed with the quality of this marble set because the blocks which have a curved tunnel are carved roughly and there is only one way to set them up so that the marble doesn't just stop in the tunnel.  If the inside of the tunnel was smooth and more carefully designed, the marbles would roll like they should.  When I was a kid, I had a fantastic wooden marble run set, but nothing on the market seems to be an equivalent.  Most of the sets have holes in the the lengthy pieces for the marbles to drop through.  I think that without the holes there are more possibilites for set up.  However, my four year old does enjoy this set.  I play with her and have shown her how to change the set up when the marble stops.  
  An extremely convoluted read. Another reader mentioned "dizzying" and I concur. Chock full of psyco-babble and others' personal stories that I found uninspiring.  The numerous exercises Myss requires of you to dissect past emotional events, felt somehow unhealthy and too self-absorbing. How can one be objective about the dynamics of past painful events since our perspective of them can change dramatically with time?      The author's voice was to me that of a least favorite professor in college. You know, the one class you would nod off on occasion? I took alot of effort for me to get through the first lengthy chapter, which I did, indeed, fall asleep around page 83.     However, the bottom line for me was the lack of joy in the authors words. I found Myss overcomplicating, and over intellectualizing too many fundamental Spiritual practicalities and principles. This book would seem better off in "general psychology" and not in the "Self-help/improvement" section of the bookstore. The over-analytical process could be enough to send someone in crisis over the edge.    
 This is a black & white edition: it does NOT include the color plates of older editions.  Without color, it is impossible to appreciate the formulations of the thought-forms.  Buy an older edition instead 
 George Segal is a good actor, but he is out of his element in this type of movie.  He is much better in light-hearted movies like "Fun With Dick and Jane."  The biggest disappointment is the dialog by Harold Pinter.  The characters exchange meaningless small talk at cross purposes while nothing happens, and we all get bored.    This spy movie is not even in the same league with "Day of the Jackel" and "The Odessa File."  I threw away my copy of "The Quiller Memorandum" after watching it once.  I can't imagine ever wanting to see it again 
 This trash can't be shown on the T 
 I don't want to come out and say that this book is entirely useless, as I feel that would be unfair.  If you do wish to read something of the famous "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" series, I recommend you read the original and stop at that.  He has a lot of good advice, but tends to repeat a lot of the information throughout his different books.  His investment strategies are a little misleading, and probably should not be attempted by anyone who has only the experience of reading these books.  I liked his approach of "not cutting up your credit cards," but found his solutions somewhat misleading and uninformative.  His writing reminds me an awful lot of the get rich quick pep rallies made famous by late night television and Amway 
 This is a very poorly written book. There is no coherence to it, no direction, no real point 
 I got this book recently, being an e4 player I figured it was time to start studying some openings a bit more in depth than just using Fritz, etc. I wanted to build a repetoire that was sound and reliable.  I am greatly dissapointed in this book. While I understand that it is a "Starting Out..." book, it seems extremely slim and the time spent on some variations seems rediculous.  At my level (1575 ICC rating), my 1.e4 is met with 1...e5 about 75% of the time. I heard this book covers recommends the Scotch game, which sounded fine to me. However, in a book of 193 pages, only FIFTEEN are devoted to the Scotch game! SEVENTY FIVE are devoted to the Sicilian, which I do understand is a very popular and theoretical defense against 1.e4 and so deserves a number of pages. However, I only see this reply to 1.e4 at my level about one in ten games. I really was hoping to have a large section on the Scotch game, with a decent amount on the Sicilian...not a large section on the Sicilian with a scant covering of the opening I and most players around my level (improving intermediate players, strong C-class) will see 75% of the time.  The writing is functional and gets the job done for explaining most concepts, but the overall dispraportioning of coverage really set me off from this book 
 The service was great I recieved my package within a week, but when i opened it i noticed that the book was damaged due to the poor handling. I guess if your looking to just have the guide for reference then you won't have a problem but if you want it for keeps then you might want to order it with some bigger stuff so it doesn't get damaged on the way 
 We were disappointed in this DVD and thought it was a waste of money. We did not learn anything new.   They went through things quickly, everything was so basic, things that are mainly common sense.  I felt this was a big huge waste of money, and is now in the trash 
 I purchased this for my eight year old niece. We were both disappointed when it broke after only two weeks.  Be prepared to have limited options for fun without downloading it on your computer. The program takes up a lot of memory on your computer's hard drive 
 Mr. Haqqani's views about his mother country are very dubious. The only question I have for the author as he served in some very corrupt governments as their partner...What has he done for his home land? Nothing!!! This book in waste of time. 
 I did not like this product. I'm not aspiring to learn how to be a coffee expert. I tried this out a few times.  It takes 5 mninutes or longer to boil the water. Its also a pain to clean and scrub.  This is a good option for people who want to learn how to make a perfect espresso. A better option is to use the AeroPress coffee and espresso maker. It's real simple to use and worked beautifully the first time and tastes as good or beter than store bought espresso. You can buy this on Amazon.  Put in the filter, add some coffee, add some hot water, stir, then press down in just a matter of seconds. Put this device over a coffee cup. Its real easy to clean 
 Don't waste your time. Find something else... I can't believe I watched this movie..good think I didn't buy it...I borrowed it from the library...lol.. 
 and that's what we got....the bird again.  Slowly paced, this story is mildly entertaining. I expected a bigger bang than what was given at the end...instead we see a blurred mythical big bird through water... It will keep your interest...but you will feel cheated by the end for wasting your time.   Rent, don't buy 
 I read this book because it says it was a best seller, and the author is supposed to be one of the best at suspense.  With those expectations I was disappointed.  The author relies on gimmicks - like ultra short chapters to make it seem like you're reading faster.  Each chapter is 1 or 2 pages with at least one blank page between, so what looks like a 400 page books is really only a 250 page short novel.  One chapter is literally a cliff-hanger.  The plot's sort of a rehash of H.G. Wells' Island Of Dr. Moreau, borrowing a bit from X-Men comic books.  The mutants are all children who can fly, and they're severely persecuted by their keepers, so perhaps what makes the book appealing to other readers is the suspense derived from the endangered children angle, another cheap gimmick.    The villains are all one-dimensional stereotypes, blindly abandoning all their principles and humanity to profit off the children.  I could point out numerous flaws in style as well - but that's not the point; you could find flaws in better books too.  The point is the book is overrated for hack writing of less quality than many old pulp magazines I've read.  Even the love scenes are corny and seem like one of those cheap romance novels ("My arms were high and tight around his neck.  He pulled me against him and I felt him, all of him, against my thigh . . ."). The author also doesn't seem to understand the geography & terrain of the area he's writing about (for example, a small Sony TV won't receive Denver channels in Gunnison National Forrest, certainly not well enough to recognize faces in long shots as the author describes), and has some weird ideas of horror ("Chain link fence and concertina wire and guard dogs in the middle of the woods were scary enough, but to see the words "U.S. Government" attached to "Trespassers Will Be Shot" made me ill.").  Much more like this is topped off with a liberal dose of hypocrisy:  "The arrogance and amorality of the scientists working here affronted everything I believed in.  I wanted to find one of 'them' and strangle the person with my bare hands."   This is the last time I'll buy a book because it says "best seller."  If you want to read a well-written sci-fi suspense novel in which the protagonist is a child prodigy, I recommend The Fourth R by George O. Smith (ISBN 1557429332 - Also known as The Brain Machine, ISBN 0824014308) 
 Chick-lit for would-be intellectual chicks.  Sorry, Da 
 Honestly, nothing about this show grabs me. I'm surprised this show gets such high Nielsen ratings every week. The writers tend to come up with similar stories all the time. But the biggest flaw is the acting. It is really laughable. Me and my friends watch this sometimes to laugh at how ridiculous everyone seems to be. Horatio Caine talks in a slow drawl all the time, saying the stupidest and most obvious things. Calleigh is always smiling at everyone and everything up to the point it gets irritating. None of the C.S.I team displays any emotion whatsoever, oh...except Horatio when he over does it.   The stories are also terribly boring and utterly predictable. If there's a V.I.P suspect with a "history" with Horatio, yup...you guessed it, he's involved (either directly or indirectly). And also, if the suspect appears in about 10 minutes into the show...yea, it's not him. And Calleigh gets "evidence" such as DNA from saliva etc almost every episode using her sexuality. I mean, once or twice is alright...but I've seen about 8-10 episodes and she does it all the time. Every criminal here is an idiot, they are sure to leave all kinds of huge "clues" leading to them or their alliances. And every crime gets solved all the time. Oh, and is it just me or does the C.S.I team seem to know everything under the sun at their fingertips, no need for books or researching, they already have it that big brain of theirs. Think that's unlikely? Exactly my point.  In short, I wouldn't move appointments or hurry home to watch this show. In fact, even if someone gives me this DVD set as a gift, I would probably keep it aside or maybe present it to someoene else. Watch this show if you're REALLY bored, with nothing else to do and no better use of your time. If you want real Crime Scene Investigation, watch the original C.S.I, Las Vegas. That's the best C.S.I....period 
 Although ths book comes back in a keword search for RADIUS, it has nearly NOTHING to say on the topic.  In fact, I may well have said more about RADIUS in this paragraph than the book says.  Maybe it's good for other topics, but sorry for RADIU 
 Writing and story were not characteristic of Grisham.  He seemed to write as if his readers could not remember what was just said in a previous paragraph.  Very preachy about the plight of the homeless.  I am giving it two stars because I could actually finish reading it, but I do not recommend this book at all 
 ...because I thought White Oleandar was brilliant. But this book? Not so much. I would not be surprised if Paint it Black were something Fitch wrote before she got her bestseller published. It felt much less fully realized. I found the text to be sprawling, unedited, self-indulgent. I generally have no problem with unreliable and/or unlikable narrators, but this one was more tiring than she was menacing. The whole book was written in one note, so I, too, agree with the "flat" description. I found the characters (the distant, brilliant, rich mother; the sassy best friend; the beautiful, troubled boyfriend) to be very stock and borderline cliche. I absolutely savored every word of Fitch's first book; reading this one, unfortunately, was like returning to a restaurant where you'd had the most amazing creme brulee of your life, only to find it cold and runny the second time you ordered it. 
 I was so disappointed when I got this book. The people who do these books always seem to have a head full of hair when they start.  I never see anyone with not-so-thick hair or less than shoulder length hair.  Her product regimen was outrageous.  Her copying and pasting from week-to-week had to be most ingenuous of all, along with pushing her own hair care products.  In all her pictures she looked "greasy", which is not a look or feel I like.  She had not even used Aphogee protein products, which ANYONE who is into hair, knows is probably one of the BEST protein products on the market, especially considering the price.  I just expected a little bit more.  On her picture in the 1990s, it was obvious she always had a full head of hair, not like a lot of black women out here.  Can someone show me how to maintain my relaxed hair, where it will have body and look healthy, and if I did choose to relax at home, the best way to do it.  We know it is a cardinal sin, but obviously people do it or there would not be so many products on the shelves and the costs to go a hairdresser is so prohibitive.  I say do not buy this book, there is hardly anything said you probably don't already know.  
 Careful reading reveals the author eliminating the parent as an authority with any rights. In this book, the author tells us that after a 15 yr old girl properly and carefuly consults with caring fellow teens and maybe a high school conselor, [parents exluded] it's fine for her to have sex with a guy for any well chosen reason, at any well chosen time, at any well chosen place. From boy to boy to boy ---.  When she one day gets married,  How Is She To Stop a Behavior She Has Made Such a Habit? Or will her modern husband care? Interesting world 
 I have wanted to see this movie since it came out in 1981 when I was first becoming interested in 60s radicalism (I was 10 at the time) and now I really wish that I had seen it then and got that particular mania out of my system.  Despite great acting by actors that had yet to be established (ironically Kevin Kline's future wife, Phoebe Cates, would be in Fast Times at Ridgement High - that other movie with a cast of well known actors that the casting director somehow managed to find before they were famous) the overall script is just a tedious mess of characters acting badly. They are either guilty about selling out or they are trying to live the pissed off radical stereotype (one that wears very thin after your 20th birthday) and Meg Tilly is just there to say some of the funniest strange lines (it's like she was auditioning for the part of River on Firefly 20 years too early). I won't deny that it's cool seeing Jeff Goldblum playing creepy and Kevin Kline fighting it otu with Jeff Daniels, but the storyline feels dated.   Last, the special features are pretty weak. The trailer is badly done. The "making of" featurette has Lawrence Kasdan saying the exact same things he says on the liner notes. And the extra scenes don't even show the Kevin Costner scenes that they filmed and edited out (which is a shame since everyone goes on about how his character was the bright spot and the center of the group, but we never get the sense that he's anything but a corpse. Of course, halfway through the movie I started to wish that Kasdan would have just done a movie abotu the Costner character with his friends as minor players - but then again when Kasdan and Costner did team up they produced the painfully dull Wyatt Earp.)  So this is an OK movie, but it's not great. It doesn't deserve the respect it gets. I'm sure there are better movies abotu college friends reuniting and/or The 60s. There have to be. Anyhow, watch it if you have the burning desire but don't pay full price 
 First off, I do not agree with Evolution, in any way, shape, or form.  However, I will say that Darwin, unlike most so called "scientists," esp. Evolutionists freely admitted that there was more to learn in the comming years, and that his theories, or hypothesis, might have to be seriously reconsidered if new scientific evidence was discovered that did not corroborate his views.    Most of what I see in scientific debates comes down to pure and simple prideful blustering, and hateful muddslinging!!!  It seems more favorable and a hec of alot easier to smear the opponant than to honestly, critically, and civily debate another person with whom you disagree.  Ego, Ego, Ego, and more Egomaniacal Monkeyshines!!!!!  I am new to this whole debate (Evolution vs. Creation / Intelligent Design), and I have alot to learn on both sides of the issue, but I can tell you this, I am honest, and civil enough to at least make an honest attempt at respecting the other side, as someone, who in my opinion, may be "wrong," but is also a human being deserving of proper respect, esp. if they have devoted years to honest scientific investigation.  All sides need to learn CIVILITY, and PROFESSIONAL RESPECT, WHICH IS SEVERELY LACKING IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TODAY, MORE THAN EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1  This is a foundational work which started the whole Evolution landslide. Anyone who truly wishes to debate, refute, or otherwise understand the theory should read it carefully.  Just as one should read carefuly, and critically those foundational works on Creation Science (A real science) and Intelligent Design (A true Scientific Theory).   Be REAL SCIENTISTS AND INVESTIGATE FOR YOURSELVES WHAT YOU BELIEVE, OR DON'T BELIEVE.   I seriously doubt that Civility will ever come to the Scientific Community as a whole, as so few people are truly willing to lay down their Egos to search out truth, especially if the opposite of their own views is terrifying to them.   Yes, there is a God, and he is not you, Dr. Ego Monkeyshines 
 All of Disneys direct to video follow ups are really starting to get tiresome. They are fast cheap ways to profit off the original and have no reason to excist. Tarzan 2 is no exception. The original Tarzan is a Disney classic. A great story of action, love, and trying to find your place in the world. Afterwords came the Legend of Tarzan series. Which featured inferior animation but decent stories. Tarzan 2 does surprise me by being the first direct to video sequel to have animation on par with the original. Breaking a long sucky tradition of sequels with inferior animation. Unfortunitly the story is below the quality of even most of the television episodes. It takes place sometime in the middle of the original sometime during the "Son of Man" song. It involves Tarzan feeling he is a danger to his family and runing away to find out what he is. The story has no strong villian, no real threats, and a cheesy as hell conflict resolution. All the elements of a kids movie that everyone over puberty will have a problem with. A real shame considering the orginal could be enjoyed equally by kids and adults. It has its cute momments and is better then many of Disneys very poor direct to video but thats not saying much going against garbage like The Lion King 1 1/2. The DVD has superb picture and sound. Why Disney denies DTS on the originls but gives it to its inferior sequels I don't know. An Ok little movie for the kids but Tarzan 2 leaves alot to be desired from adult fans of the original 
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 The bigger the intellectual, the less truth you need in your words.   Sure you can believe in Jesus and the goddess, you just have to forget everything Jesus ever said. This is like believing in the political ideologies of Ghandi and favoring the military accomplishments of the Third Reich.   If you follow the ideas in this book, I can assure you that you do NOT believe in the Jesus of the Bible (remember, the real one?), but only a media image of a long haired man with a beard. One would hope you would take your faith more seriously than that.  
 This book is awful.  I read it, and I couldn't wait to finish it.  I would have flipped it in the trash can except I had to read it for school.  The characters are pathetic, there is no grasp of dialogue, and the author admits that it is the same thing as an F. Scott Fitzgerald book that was already written.  How it became a Newberry winner I will never know 
 At best a mediocre jazz trumpeter-he should stick to classical music.   One would be far better off purchasing music from any great classic trumpet player such as Clifford Brown, Dizzy, Louis, Miles, Fats Navarro, Hot Lips Page, Buck Clayton,- or any other superior player. Just because he plays a Monette and worships Louis doesn't mean he can play jazz.  
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 "The Koreans have established a group they call the anti-Japanes Communist party. Koreans were part of the Japanese Empire but hated the Japanese and hated the war." quote from page. 89 This book has a high risk of being misread by people who are not aware of the Korea-Japan history. Japan brutally "invaded" Korea. The author knows this. But she still describes Korea as if it is supposed to be part of Japan.   If you are not aware of the history, you would think "damn those Korean communists, why do they hate Japanse? What's wrong with them?" Imagine,  "Netherland people have established a group they call anti-German Communist party. Netherland was part of the German Empire but hated the Germans and hated the war." Would you want your kids who are not aware of the German invasion, to read this and think that Netherland people were wrong?  The book describes Koreans as cruel, barbarious people who tries to harm innocent Japanese people, who are described as the victims.  Come on!! Japanese were the invaders, and Koreans were the victims!! The hardships that she goes through is because of all the atrocities that Japanes has committed to Koreans!!   This is a well written book, but if it can form a misconception about history, it should not be recommended by school teachers to their students.  Especially, the Japanese still have not apologized for all the atrocities they have done to Koreans, Chinese, and other Asian countries. At least Germans have apologized for what they've done. I'm very sure there are much better books that can be recommended.   The author's father was a high official who worked in manchuria, where Unit 731 was using Koreans and Chinese people like lab mice to test their biological weapons.  Search Unit 731 in wikipedia if you don't know what I'm talking about. Search Asian Holocaust, for other atrocities that Japan has committed. 
 This was an interesting book.  However, the content was, in my opinion, limited.  It was more like an outline with a few details.  Information was interesting; but seemed to skim the surface of everyday Amish life.  
 I gotta admit--the concept is great.  AS you drive, you sit on a nicely cushioned seat cover that also:  1. Massages your upper back, lower back, or both, 2. Has an optional heating unit for comfort and warmth, and 3. Plugs into your auto's cigarette lighter.  The massage is conducted though 5 vibrating balls located inside the cushion, and therein, literally, lies the problem.  The ball located in the center of the upper part of the cushion digs--annoying, uncomfortably, and very noticeably--into your back, rendering the whole massage/comfort angle a moot point.  As well as the rest of this works, and it does (the heat is perceptible, the other four balls feel fine, the cushion fits snugly around your seat with a velcro-closed belt), that one protruding ball makes this an uncomfortable experience.  I'm taking mine back.  On the positive side, the company is just one "point" away from a very good product.  If you see this (or something like it), try to "test drive" it at the store.  Maybe this company (or others) place the balls in a better position in other products.  A few other notes:  You cannot turn the heat on independent of the massage; that is, if the massager is not on, you cannot turn the heater on. Also, this is not shiatsu-like massage, not at this price. You're getting an electricity-generated vibration here, at two speeds, low and high.  At the high speed, you feel more stimulated than relaxed, as if somehow one of those old vibrating foorball game surfaces were up against your back. In fact, the brief manual accompanying the BK-2500 cautions people against using this at night, as it may keep you awake for a little while.  Still, if you like a back buzz, and you find a similar cushion without that very uncomfortable center ball (didn't anyone test this thing?), you might enjoy a product like this.  But...not this one.  
 This is a poorly written book with many glaring ommissions 
 In today's world, various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism. These forms of parochialism may be ethnic, "cultural," religious, nationalistic, etc., depending on where you look. On one hand, ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups; on the other hand, multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace.  Example: the Turks and the Armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict ("Jihad" is Barber's label for this); yet they see the same Pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local Pepsi bottling plants ("McWorld" is Barber's label for this).  That's the book.   This might be a useful resource for writers of term papers who need to endnote something fairly obvious. Outside of that, it would take an observer from another planet to find this book's insights novel or pointed. If you're new to planet Earth, by all means pick up a copy. It will catch you up on a few useful truisms.  As others have pointed out, the "terrorism's challenge to democracy" subtitle seems intended to capitalize on 9/11, but doesn't accurately reflect the book's content. "Jihad" is deployed as a synecdoche in this book; Muslim extremism is just one of the book's many examples of parochialism 
 Hi, I recently bought this game guide hoping that it would help me get all the achievements on the xbox360 version... I was wrong... this guide is a base guide for all systems... so it's really not helpful in what i am looking for.... as far as game guides go... everyone might want to stick with brady game guide 
 I can't believe what a useless waste of space this "vacuum cleaner" is. I've had it less than a year. On the 2nd use, the first belt broke. It goes through belts like my 3 year old goes through clothes. The hose won't consistently stay clamped to the handle, falling into your knees as you try to push the thing. I can't get through a single job without it clogging and respreading the dirt everywhere as I try to unclog it. Its a 3-4 step process if it clogs further inside the filter sending me into a full-blown asthma attack (and my asthma is pretty mild). Its going to the curb on the next trash pick-up because now the clamp that holds it locked upright is now broken and I don't even know how that managed to happen. I guess at about $90 you get what you pay for. Those Dyson's better be worth the $[...] because I'm getting one tomorrow 
 I like Ludacris. Don't get me wrong.  But this album is kinda annoying.  The blow it out yer ass song is hard to listen to and repetitive.  The splash waterfalls song is also really redudant, if you heard it on the radio as many times as I did, you might agree.  He just talks through too much of this album... instead of rapping.. the beats are kinda weak and repetitive.. there are 3 good songs on this one: Diamonds in the Back, We Got, and Eyebrows Down.  The rest of them are kinda annoying.  But like I said I DO like Luda.. just get red light district or word of mouf instead 
 Standard Heinlein Disclaimer: Heinlein is a frequently-polarizing figure in American literature. The people who dislike his work (e.g., A. Panshin) seem to *really* dislike his work, and often for reasons that seem to me spurious. The people who like his work are in many cases blind or too forgiving of Heinlein's problems as a writer. I like Heinlein's work quite a bit, and find all but two of his novels consistently enjoyable, but I would not rate any but one or possibly two of his books as being the "best of the SF genre." They are for me, however, always enjoyable, and that is no small thing to find in an author.   And as you may have guessed, this is one of the two.  (The other is "Rocketship Galileo" which, in my opinion, only suffers from the mistakes of a person new to writing novels, and a hoary "Nazis on the Moon!" plotline that, to put it mildly, has not worn well with time.)  The story behind this book is, apparently, that Heinlein was ill as he was finishing it, and it was published without the traditional editing cycle that he usually employed.  Could be.  Frankly, it's hard for me to imagine editing making this novel more readable.  This is a relatively interesting idea (a man's brain transplanted into a woman's body), but as many others have pointed out, the execution is poor.  Frankly, there's not much story here at all, aside from a man exploring what it's like being in a woman's body.  But the exploration is by turns dull and absurd.  Man in woman's body has many sexual flings!  Man in woman's body poses nude for a painter!  Man in woman's body cooks dinner for widower husband!  Man in woman's body finds that piano lessons he took as a boy are now useless, but he can run secretarial equipment!  The thrills never stop.  There are any number of other irritating things about this book (personally, I find being forced to try to pronounce "Joan" as "Joanne" really irritating, but that's probably just me [If you want it pronounced "Joanne", spell it that way, Bob!]), but I'll let you read the other reviews.  The summation is, for this lover of Heinlein, who has read almost everything he wrote, I can't reread this novel.  And for me, folks, that's really saying something 
 I played this game until Chapter 23. All the Dancing Levels were VERY HARD to beat! I think this game is not worth buying-- rent it 
 While the author has some good ideas for start-up businesses, she is behind the times.  Keep in mind it was most recently published 6 years ago.  Read it to get ideas, but don't count on it to reflect current trends.   According to the author, typing, word processing, old school computer  languages, and pagers are all in hot demand 
 I read on internet about this western version of Mahabharata and was curious to watch how Peter Brook captured it with his western mindset. After watching the movie on DVD which I bought, I was shocked and repented for buying it in first place. It was completely un-artistic and several incidents depicted in the movie are incorrect and the characters barring Draupadi  are hardly any reflection of the characters that Indians understand. Perhaps it is more apt to say that an average indian without knowledge of this movie wouldn't have guessed that he/she was watching Mahabharata. I am sure it's offensive to Hindu's faith, I think Mr.Brook should have limited his ambitions to produce simple stories rather than attempting to screen the greatest epic on earth with his limited understanding and parochial vision and in the process, reducing it to lower than street side drama. Suffice to say that the dramas played by primary school kids were several cuts above this movie. If I had an option, I would have given negative rating !        
 What? The movies aren't abridged enough? Why not discover the beauty of a real work of literature by actually reading it? Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is moving and entertainingn on its own.  Why let weak prose butcher literature with overly simplistic, inaccurate, and didactic notes 
 I feel so bad for the author, but not bad enough to keep this book.  It's being returned.  Although the written content is excellent, 10 of the meager 18 photos of Motherwell's work are problematic -- nine have been inadvertently cropped during the printing, and one is both cropped and printed upside down.  These books should have been withdrawn and reprinted, but instead, Columbia University Press tucked a little sheet into the dust jacket explaining their regret.  It's hard to believe they proceeded with the distribution of this book, and retail it for $46.  This is unconscionable in any book, but especially an art book on a noted figure like Motherwell.  Please note that Amazon says the other reviewer's comments are based on a different edition 
 For the Mob historian there's nothing really new here outside of lotsa pure fiction. If you want the real story of Sam Giancana check out "The Don" by William Brashler, "Mafia Princess" by Sam's daughter Toni, and Bill Roemer's bio of Tony Accardo. But forget the hogwash of "Double-Cross" 
 Having so much enjoyed the first two volumnes in this series, I was not prepared for this turgid list of self improvement. Yes Clive is well read, English and Italian, yes he does know the difference between a Donatello and a Michelangelo, but do we need to know every book he read in the two years, every painting he saw and how it moved him. The simple answer is no. Unfortunately it takes 250 pages to find out. The story of how a drunken extemely funny youth becomes a sober mildly funny old pseud 
 I really didn't like this book to say the least.  I didn't like the way it was written.  I didn't like the story line at all.  None of it made much of any sense and much of it seemed to contradict some basic Jedi guidelines.  I was looking forward to reading this I thought it would go more into the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin a few years after Episode 1.  I thought it might include some insight on Padawan training.  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  Overall it was a really stupid story that wasn't at all believable, even in the realm of the Star Wars universe.  Just bad.  It does have a couple relevant story lines that you might want to know if you plan on or do read all the Star Wars books published. I would only read this if you are one of those people, otherwise I would definitely recommend skipping this one 
 I was so excited to find an evidence based manual therapy text I read part of the chapter on the shoulder the first night. I found four possibly five typos. Unfortunately this leads me to distrust the information I have less experience with 
 I was born and raised in India on the wrong side of the caste system. I worked hard to become educated and to come to America. Perhaps in the 1960s, America was not as fair as it is now, but it was still better than anywhere else. I find books like this, where people whine about the amount of melanin in their skin, offensive. Angelou comments often about how much she hates white people. This is stupid and it shows how uneducated she still is.   If she had written this in the 1960s, in the throes of it, it might be interesting as a historical piece, but now it just shows how racist she it. I'll bet she hates Asians, too. Even when she was abandoned in Egypt by a man she wrongly called her "husband," (even though they weren't married,) she wouldn't go to the American embassy for help because white people worked there. Every slight in her life, she attributes to white people being racist because she is black.   This book is filled with name-dropping and smug anger.   Minn 
 As an avid jets fan I would recommend that Herm read his own book. Some better titles for this book would have been:  - You play to win the game but I play not to lose it. (I guess that is a little long winded)  - Why play to win the game when losing 75% of the time can get you a new 4 year contract?  - You play to RENEGOTIATE!  - Just give me the damn contrac 
 Big plus was the large digits on display: I'm short-sighted and run without my specs, so I needed that. The feel of the watch is nice. However, one big problem with it was that moving my wrist around kept poking the buttons and changing the display without warning (maybe because I have big wrists). Bigger problem yet: it took all of about 4 months for the plastic strap to break 
 This TV has a great picture and would be a 5 star rating if it had acceptable  warranty service. I bought this TV in December and it worked great for about a month. The cooling fan for the bulb started malfunctioning and would only allow the TV to work for a few minutes before shutting it down. I reported the problem to Samsung and have waited for three weeks with no resolution. They say the reason for the delay is the lack of a local authorized repair center to perform the in-home repair. I have no idea of how much longer I will have to wait before I get my TV replaced or repaired. I cannot recommend Samsung because of their poor warranty service....buy a Sony!! 
 I was so excited when I ordered my Star Wars Holographic Emperor figure. I'd been waiting for this exclusive figure be available for weeks!! When I got home today, the box with the Amazon logo was on my doorstep. Upon opening the box, I was completely disappointed to find that the Emperor figure I'd been waiting for was damaged since it was jammed into the box so that the backing card was crushed. The people packing this stuff are half-wits!! Anybody with a brain would know better than to  cram something into a box like that!! They should be ashamed of their service & to all you collectors out there....BEWARE!! 
 I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read.  
 In the essay on Patrick O'Brian to be found on its website, the W.W. Norton Company comments upon O'Brian's rare civility in dealings with his publisher. Certainly Norton has repaid him with an incivility perhaps even more rare by subjecting his great work, now that he is dead and unable to protest, to an editor who obviously neither reads nor understands English. Other reviewers here have enumerated the kinds of error that make almost every other page of The Complete Aubrey/Maturin Novels difficult, sometimes impossible, for a close, careful and experienced reader to decipher and will certainly leave young, less experienced readers baffled and ultimately disgusted with the works themselves. I wish only to suggest, to anyone wanting to read these novels for the first or second or hundredth time, or to give them as a gift, that he or she find another edition and avoid this one. And to suggest, also, that whoever at Norton wrote, in the O'Brian article on that website, that his publishers were sorry they would not be seeing him again, should reconsider that statement. His publishers ought to be very, very glad to be beyond the man's reach after having offered him this appalling insult. 
 I REPEAT: WHY THE HELL IS THIS BEING SOLD FOR SUCH A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY ??? IF ANYONE ORDERED THIS FROM THIS SELLER FOR THIS AMOUNT...LOAD A GUN AND END IT NOW ..... -CHRI 
 I'm a big fan of Ms. Ely's book, Saving Dinner, so I was very excited to find her study guide for kids.  However, I was disappointed to open the box and find only 32 one-sided pages, loose with no binding at all.  Of these, only 21 pages are worksheets and parent guides--the rest are a food diary!  It's cleverly designed and kid-friendly, but not worth $8.95!  In addition, the information is heavily weighted toward identifying carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.  Good info for kids, but I was hoping to steer my picky eater toward fruits and veggies and there was little information on the their benefits.   
 I did not care for the endless repetition with minor variations. I did not care for the one-sidedness of it all--man gets off, maid is out in the cold. I did not care for the endless repetition with minor variations. One  had the feeling someone was trying out a lit'rary exercise and it got  published by mistake. One had no sympathy for any one in the book, and one  felt one was overcharged 
 This is truly a disappointing book.  It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become interested in the plot.  Another disappointment is Koontz's recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky, highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in "The Hideaway" had almost identical deformities and personality), (2) devoted, super-powered canine companions, (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out RVs, and (4) evil bioethicists.  The Leilani character is patently ridiculous.  She conveniently has a genius IQ, but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable.  I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot.  Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children, and this book is no exception.  Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds; the latter, however, does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults.  Dean heaps the hardships on poor Leilani, with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger.  In case you miss the anvils, you are supposed to really, really like her and fear for her safety.  I don't know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics, but he has a terribly misguided view of the field, taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field.  Further, he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student, I can assure you that this is patently untrue.  That Koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow.  The final issue is Koontz's near-deification of dogs, particularly Golden Retrievers, which is a common motif in his more recent works.  It is ridiculous and unintentionally funny to an almost painful degree.  His obsession with dogs and their mystical powers borders on the psychotic (and I like dogs).  This novel probably features the most egregious example of Koontz's tendency to create overly sappy, sugary-sweet endings.  Dean Koontz has written many books better than this one.  Spend your money on one of his stronger efforts 
 Funny how people always vote a review to be "not helpful" when the reviewer expresses an opinion the voter doesn't like...  If you are a mickey d's binger who gets pissed off when people expose the fact that their food is utter garbage (or, if you are a Mc-Exec), you'll automatically hate my review or any others like mine.  But if you're here to really see what someone who hasn't been mc-brainwashed, hopefully this review will help you.   This book tells an accurate tale of the solely profit-focused means by which mcdonald's has grown into the fast food empire it is today.  Sure, it's a capitalistic wet dream.  But what this book doesn't cover is how Mickey-D's exloits workers, vales corporate profits over franchise success, and feeds people McGarbage that can't even be called food, all without being honest about its products or practices.  I'm sure devoted McEaters and McCapitalists will trounce my 1-star rating & review, but that really just proves my point.  Read this book.  But if you care to know the WHOLE story, be sure to also read something presenting another view - such as Fast Food Nation 
 The cover of the CD, which provided the inspiration for the album title and song according to the liner notes, shows an industrial wasteland created by communists in the former Soviet empire. The back cover shows a defaced billboard which mocks the United States of America and its position in the world.  The contradiction provided by the juxtaposition of these images is lost on Gilkyson and shows the level of sophistication one might expect from someone with only a high school education like her.  The opening song, "Hiway 9," uses the melody and tempo of a children's song to support a frivolous political commentary.  This includes the racist attack that, Colin Powell, one of this country's greatest public servants, is "a white man hidden in a black man's skin."  Charming, especially considering that Gilkyson's family comes from the Philadelphia Social Register.  Things don't get much better from there with the usual puerile lyrics (Not Lonely, Wonderland, Separated) about longing for love and lust, which are getting a little odd coming from a 50 year old woman who has had more than her share of lovers.  The third cut, "Dark Side of Town," is about one of her sister's innumerable boyfriends, a substance abuser who died recently of compications from Hep C.  The album is dedicated to him at end of the liner notes.  Great, that's inspiring to us all Eliza!  The song Tender Mercies starts off with words of sympathy for a suicide bomber who kills Jews at an Israeli shopping mall.  Once again, the deeper meaning of such an act is lost to Eliza.  Elsewhere, the "Milk and Honey" track manages to be pompous and trite at the same time while attempting profundity, and a children's song from her father is included.  The closing Woody Guthrie tune is far and away the best thing on the album.  It harks back to a time when those on the political left and right in this country could unite to fight Woody's favorite enemy: facists.  Too bad Gilkyson and her ilk don't even recognize the problem today, just like the isolationists in the 30s.  As she says in "Milk and Honey" - "god's children....doomed to repeat history. 
 Is it me or did the author of the book in question most likely write that last review? The writer ran out and bought 5 copies to give to his friends? You have got to be kidding me.  I haven't read the book, it may very well be good, but I highly doubt that last review was by someone that is not connected somehow to profiting by this books sales.  I have read Giuliano's books before and have enjoyed them, but he is seen with such skepticism by most who know anything about the Beatles that I find it hard to believe that anyone not connected to the book would dish out such over the top praise as the last review.  
 That was pretty much how I felt after finishing this terrible book.  I'm a Buffy fan (something of a purist - as I don't like the Angel spin-off), and only an occasional reader of BTVS novels, which - except for The Lost Slayer - always disappointed me. They were like McDonalds food - good to have around when Buffy's not on TV, but never satisfying.  So when I saw this novel, I thought it would be good. Holder is a four-times Bram Stoker award winner, and I figured the first novel set after the climax of the BTVS TV show would be of a much higher quality than previous novels, to satisfy the BTVS fans who want the story to continue.  But I was very wrong.  This book is absolutely god-awful.  I'd give it zero stars, if I could.  It's hard to pick on thing that makes this book so bad. Unscary and cliched villains; Regular Buffy characters acting out of character (since when does Oz give speeches?); Terrible dialogue (unrealistic, and with none of the wit or intelligence that's the hallmark of the TV show); The Yet Another Apocalypse plot, (something which Whedon and co. acknowledged was a cliche when the TV shows were running within the shows' storylines); Ignoring the continunity set up by the final series of Angel; during which this book is set (unless the worldwide Apocalyptic weather systems featured in this book decided to skip LA, and no one at Wolfram and Hart thought to tell Angel "A Hellmouth in Cleveland has opened"); Borderline racist characterisation of non-Americans (all Italians speak-a like-a this-a and are obsessed with clothes, while girls from Indian are all shy and hide behind veils); And there's the uncountable number of unnamed new Slayers who are casually slaughtered (it seems a new Slayer has a shorter life expectancy than a red-shirted officer in Star Trek).  But the worst thing about this book are the events Holder skips - battle scenes, action sequences, and major dramatic events she set up earlier in the book - they're just skipped and you're told the result of what happened.  For example, early in the book Buffy and co. encounter a pack of shapeshifters and go out hunting (doesn't have any bearing on the main plot). Only I think they do, because Holder skips the entire hunt. Buffy and co discover the monsters.  Turn the page, the critters are all dead.  The same thing is repeated again, and again, and again. Big set up. Expectation raised of major drama/action scenes. Turn the page and the events already in the past - sometimes by days.  Admittedly BTVS jumps around genres with wild abandon, but action is a major part of the series and the novels. Something that Holder either doesn't want to handle or can't write, so skips.  Even major events in the story - including the final battle, are skipped.  The only good thing about this book is twist at the very end, which completes the "Journey to adulthood" arc Whedon and co have been running since the start of season 4 of BTVS.  However, its execution makes me think Holder got her idea from reading Buffy slash fiction, and too many reports of angels visiting the dying in hospitals.  Only BTVS fans would buy this book, but they'll end up hating it.  In my view Holder took the publisher's money, handed in a first draft, and then legged it.  That all said, I found this book inspirational.  Because after reading it I thought, "I can write a better novel than this piece of junk!"  If you're a BTVS fan, avoid this book and spend your money on the new Buffy comic coming from Dark Horse - it's Buffy the Vampire Slayer, season 8 written by Joss Whedon 
 From previous reviews, I got the idea that "Never come Morning" would be gritty, and a masterpiece.  Well, that's not the case.  It is quite gritty, with EVERYONE a crook, from a Polish barber who is also a pimp, from the one-eyed police detective.  The story follows Bruno, a thug who dreams of well..being the Great White Hope.  Of course, we know he's a thug, and will always be nothing but a thug.  Bruno and his thuggish friends talk in a Chicago dialect that grates on your nerves.  Algren is not Mark Twain, so it further alienates the reader when you want to hear English you can recognize.  I felt zero sypathy for Bruno's predicament, and I felt sick that Steffi would see anything in this character 
 The Stephen Mitchell version of the Tao Te Ching will please the philosophical bent and Weltanschauung of certain modern and post-modern readers. On points it is extremely Spinozan. To recognize that many readers will like it, perhaps like it a great deal, is not to suggest that it is an 'authentic' translation, because it is not. To Mitchell's credit, he acknowledges this (after a fashion, at least). He thinks he is relating what Lao Tzu really meant to say to 20th century readers. Certain 21st century western readers may agree with Mitchell, but I expect that most scholars will not.  The prospective reader should be aware that this is the Way of Stephen Mitchell, which, at least on some points, is not the Way of the "ancient masters." I strongly suggest that this NOT be the first or the only 'version' of the Tao Te Ching that you read. In fact, [assuming that you prefer not to be misled] I suggest that you don't read it at all. The [authentic] Tao Te Ching is a fascinating text, counter-intuitive and challenging, worthy of our contemplation and puzzlement thousands of years after its writing. This volume isn't. 
 I'm not happy.  The filter needed changing one day out of the box.  We have soft water so this should have lasted a while.  Difficult to hang on to when filling, have to hold it like a baby.  Does put out the air though and fits about anywhere 
 Alright, first of all, I have read dozens of books on nutrition and weight, etc., many of which were inspiring and very helpful. I highly doubt that many women in 2006 lack general nutrition knowledge, but if they do, it can be found easily online or in the library. Dr. Northrup's advice was ludicrous. 30 grams of carbs per day? I was encouraged when she began by citing Geneen Roth, but things deteriorated from there until I wanted to throw the book out the window. If anyone is looking for a mind-body approach to food, please, PLEASE do not read Dr. Northrup's chapter on "nutrition." Instead, I would recommend Fed Up by Dr. Wendy Oliver-Pyatt, Eating Mindfully by Dr. Susan Albers, any book by Geneen Roth, or even How Much Does Your Soul weigh, by Dr. Dorie McCubbrey. These books adress eating mindfully, allowing yourself to enjoy the foods you love while paying attention to your body's responses. Dr. Northrup's "nutrition" chapter is just another externally driven, trendy, but ultimately ineffective attempt to control weight and promote health (She calls herself a "sugar addict" and if you want information about that, read something like sugar busters (until you figure out that ALL diets will never work long-term). Anyway, I think she's a nut, and I wish that consumers were more perceptive and less desperate and likely to grasp at straws like Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom. 
 In its time, Rand's vision was intoxicating.  We are now living in a reality where big business pretty much influences everything in our lives, and the society that it has produced isn't exactly what Rand envisioned.  The idea of an unrestrained capitalism sounds wonderful as a philosophy.  But in truth, it's just as dangerous as total government control: Exxon Mobil, Walmart, etc. are not businesses, but institutions with power over our every day lives.  I don't think that this is the world that Rand intended, but it's the outcome of her philosophy.  Her efforts, while noble, have proven to be a failure.  
 better to purchase the Harry James Trumpet Blues CD.  It has the better versions of his songs with Helen Forest, including the better version of "I've heard that song before".  Go figure 
 Antonline lies about their shipping to the US. I am in the US and they won't ship here. If these guys want to ship only to the continental US, they should say so and not have Amazon's customets in Hawaii and Alaska waste time on them 
 I loved this movie ever since I first saw it. So, when I finally found the DVD, I was excited to see it again. But as I watched it, I was so dissappointed at the scenes either cut short or removed. Scenes deleted include Mattie finding Ms Eva dead, Basil complaining about the prision conditions, the kids going to see the play, Theresa helping the little girl who fell, and the "meatloaf incident". Other scenes are cut short. This DVD definitely disappointed 
 The author was not present at any of the scenes preceding the crime or at the crime itself. He did not interview these (deeply inarticulate) kids until sometime after they were arrested. But suspiciously, the book recounts all sorts of details and incidents and long conversations that all take place before the murder--details that I fear the author may have novelized. Just a few examples: (1) Back when the character of Allie was 12, the author tells us that she "came home stinking...of adolescent sex." Who was the author's source for that detail? (2) Before Ali recruits Donny for the murder, the two talk, and Donny "nodded at the pleasant tree-lined street of new middle class homes... 'I think she [his mother]'s happy here. She likes it a lot better than Taunton.'"  Who would remember this burst of speech months after it had been made? Donnie? Ali? I doubt it. Perhaps the author heard Donnie say it at another time and transferred it to this scene? (3) "His mouth swollen with salami, Donnie said, 'We're gonna go see a Mafia hit man?' (who remembered the salami detail, and who remembered the sentence that was muffled by Donnie's salami-mouth?). (4) The prosecutor is described as alone in a room, but the author says that the prosecutor "stacked the files on the desk in front of him, shaped the pile with the flats of his hands." (Who reported that detail to the author, if no one but the prosecutor was in the room? Surely the prosecutor himself did not report on his own behavior to such a degree of minutiae.)  Unfortunately, almost every page has some detail or some dialogue that sounds guessed at or made up or "re-created."  I was unhappy to see that the author did not document a single source, let alone include a source section at the end of the book, a section detailing all his interviews, his written sources, etc., the way a professional reporter would have. Journalistically, this is amateurish work, and hard to trust 
 The problem with being self-righteous is that, in time, people discover you're hypocrite. Way to cheat on your wife Bill. Now, go after someone who doesn't exercise your idea of family values 
 Up front, let us grant that Haught gets a few things straight.  He acknowledges the impact Darwin has had on our view of life.  And the supernatural.  Many of Darwin's successors declared natural selection signalled the end of theism.  That terminal judgment will be addressed in this book, but he warns that theology must still "come to grips" with the "opulence of evolution".   From this opening he seeks to create a new theology.  In order to launch this enterprise, Haught must sweep away some obstructions.  Among these obstacles is the wave of "intelligent design" [which is neither] - Michael Behe's excuse for failing to understand how natural selecton works.  Haught dismisses Behe with ease, claiming the idea "ignores novelty".  So far, so good.  Haught then mounts his pulpit to steal a book title as a means of launching an assault on Darwin's most penetrating students, Daniel C. Dennett and Richard Dawkins.  "Darwin's Dangerous Idea" [1995] is what this book is about.  Haught flaunts the term often.  Each time, he tries to discount it, sniping at Dennett for being "prolific" and his presentation as done "in laborious detail".  The detail appears to have been too much for Haught, since he seems to have missed many of the more obvious points.  Dawkins, a much more outspoken non-theist than Dennett, if that's possible, gives Haught the vapours.  Dawkins' "selfish gene", a frequent target of theists, here undergoes the usual vilification.  It's "materialist" and "mechanistic".  When you're building a case for the supernatural, such ideas are anathema.  Perhaps even worse for Haught than the "Three-D" figures is that of Edward O. Wilson.  At least Dennett and Dawkins aren't lapsed Christians, but Wilson shed his Baptist upbringing when he discovered gods and life aren't related.  What greater betrayal could a theologian encounter?  While Haught is disparaging the non-theists, he steps back a bit.  He wants to show he's a reasonable man.  We're all good fellas, here.  He demonstrates his knowledge [such as it is] of Darwin's Dangerous Idea, but he wants to add a new element.  A deity.  Somewhere in the process some god has to be involved, he says.  Well, his god at any rate.  That step back puts him on a slippery slope.  As Haught builds his thesis, you observe him sliding down the ramp.  The ramp is labelled "sophistry" and Haught has a supreme talent for it.  He wants to create a "theology of evolution" - perhaps one of the more bizarre concepts of modern times.  Haught takes us through "laborious detail" in explaining how many philosophers and theologians have struggled to merge Darwin and a deity.  All have failed and Haught is no exception.  Haught's sophistry utilises a range of voices.  He even snares Taoism for a prop.  He finally selects two buttresses - Jesuit Teilhard de Chardin and philosopher Hans Jonas.  De Chardin's struggle to reconcile natural selection with metaphysics has been refuted too many times to recount here.  Jonas may be new to some of Haught's readers, but Haught attempts to introduce him.  A follower of Alfred North Whitehead, Jonas was also influenced by Jewish Kabbalistic thought.  He contends the deity [please note "the"] made the universe with the "promise" of life - and, one presumes, at some point would produce an intellect to observe it.  Jonas pushes this deity about as far from human ken as can be achieved and still have any meaning.  As a stretch of conceivability and expression of unreality, there are few peers.  What purpose such a deity could have remains escapes understanding - and reason.  It turns out this is the whole point - at some future time one of natural selection's products, humanity, will reach an "Omega Point" to encounter this deity.  To what end isn't explained.  Books such as Haught's are attempts to reconcile the irrational with the real.  Limited, as he is, by his Roman Catholic Christianity, he starts with a flimsy a priori stance.  He then tries to shore it up with a confusion of quotations synopsised ideas.  As we wade through his quote snippets, we learn that an event never historically justified, a crucifixion, provides one gleam of illumination for his thesis.  A dim light to steer by.

 The book covers a fascinating subject because Porfirio Rubirosa was among the top playboys of his day. However, the writing style of author Shawn Levy is of the tabloid variety with little to back his ever-present purported subjective hypothesis and lame attempts at humor.  A straightforward biography with fleshed-out facts would have been far more appreciated by this reader than the filler that comprised most of the book 
 Having worked for years with children on all levels of the autism spectrum, I truly doubt many of those listed; i.e. [...], Andy Kaufman, etc. actually belong anywhere on the spectrum.  Parents continually face denial and try to rewrite diagnoses to fit there own agenda.  Autism is the symptoms of a disability or combinations of disabilities NOT a disability in itself.  All autistics share the lack of social pragmatic skills but each suffer from their own set of neurological damage. Unfortunately, it continues to be the label du jour that parents can most readily accept 
 While this book does present useful topics that are particularly relevant to AJAX applications, my main problem with it is the poorly edited and structured way it is written.   The book is full of paragraphs like this one (found at the very beginning of the "Applicability section" of the "Decoupled Navigation Pattern"):  "The Decoupled Navigation pattern is used when content is navigated. The statement is obtuse and does not really say anything because HTML content is always navigated. However, because of the way Dynamic HTML is used, content navigation is sometimes used to generate an effect. When links are used to generate effects, the Decoupled Navigation pattern does not apply."  That's the whole paragraph beginning to end -- what the heck is this trying to say? Apparently aware of how non-sensical this is, the author starts the next paragraph with "To clarify this explanation..." and then goes on to present an example of a website in Swiss German (I think), with no translation given. Two pages of more examples and a summary rules-of-thumb later, and the only implied take-away is that the Pattern applies when decision-making and data processing are required, and the contents of the page change but not completely.  A few sections like this could be forgiven (and you could quibble as to why he had to write this example this way), but stuff like this prevails throughout every chapter. More often than not, ideas which with some thought could have been condensed into a few sentences, result in half a page of digressions and logical dead-ends.  Here's another one:  "The need to separate the resource from the representation has not been adequately explained, and some developers may wonder why it is necessary at all. After all, may websites work well and nobody has complained too loudly. The reason why many websites work well is because they have probably implemented the separation of resource from representation. And those that have not done so have received complaints."  Upon reading this, I feel some irreplaceable portion of my lifespan has just been wasted.  At least one good thing this book does is that it only focuses on Patterns that are particular to an AJAX environment (e.g. Persistent Communications, Decouple Navigation, etc.), without wasting time on stuff that is applicable to other more general software design settings (which plenty of other books already cover of course).   While the ideas in this book are interesting and potentially useful to somebody beginning to design an AJAX application, the writing style makes reading it a true chore. Surely there is better written stuff out there on AJAX software design 
 I wanted to see this film in theaters. I am a Cronen fan. I admit. I wasn't really a huge fan on Viggo Mortensen. I never read the book, but somehow I was drawn to this film, indirectly.  So, I wait for the DVD. Which isn't such a bad DVD as it is a film. Firstly, there are no surprises. Any surprises this movie could possibly have in store for us was revealed in either the trailer, the DVD cover, or the DVD ad. Viggo's performance as a whole, wasn't too shabby. Ed Harris was obviously the one man shining through this dark and boring movie. So in this small, secluded town Tom Stall aka 'Joey, turns out to save some lives and becomes a hero. Although, it turns out Tom Stall wasn't much of a hero as he was a villain. That's about it. The movie drags it ending around like a dogs rear on the carpet.  The sex scenes felt out of place more than anything. I couldn't stress that enough. I'm going to be blunt. They are too random. They are in bad taste. They are uncomfortable. They are very much disliked by me, personally.  And finally, the ending. The ending was probably the most empty finish I've ever witnessed. Tom Stall goes after his brother, takes care of him, drives back, and Sits down for a nice meal with the family. Three words. Fade to black.  I give this movie 2 out of 5 stars. For two reasons. Some of the action scenes were interesting, and Ed Harris. I would not recommend this film 
 I just have a correction for the user that made a complete list of all the songs in the movie. I think the name was "A Music Fan" but I'm not sure.  "Walkin' On Sunshine" was sung by Katrina and the Waves, not K.C. and the Sunshine Band.  For those of you not sure, that is the first song on Jack Black's character's monday morning tape.  Plus, I just want to say that Bonet's pathetic singing making it on the record and not Katrina and the Waves is just sad 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 THis is a tedious, by the numbers biography that reads like an appointment diary. The authors have done their research, but a biography should be more than a who dined where on such and such a date. Most of this was gained from Kay's journals. Little insight is given to who Kay Francis was as a person, which is crucial to a biography. The book concentrates and inordinate amount of time on Kay's love life and the list of her lovers gets quite tedious after awhile. The book is less than 200 pages long and is a paperback. The pictures are nice, but one expects more from a book for this price. Most of her films are judged by film reviewer quotes giving the impression the authors couldnt be bothered to view the films themselves. This is definitely the lesser of the 2 recent Kay Francis biographies. I dont really understand the rave reviews for this book, as it is one of the most disappointing Hollywood biographies I've read in quite awhile. [...

 Although the book could be praised for its excrutiatingly thorough detail, I was personally disappointed.  The book is more suited to a "credit class" scholarly group than the casual reader, such as I,  searching simply for an entertaining understanding of the event. Despite the fact that the author includes minute detail such as pay records, important illustrations such as maps relating to the campaign and battles are not included in the text at point of discussion and lack clarity when found in the Appendix.  Adding to my personal confusion was the omission of a glossary defining a multitude of terms which would be familiar only to those with a background in medieval warfare.  
 "Tribulation Force" is not as good as the first book in the "Left Behind" series.  The authors seem to be doing so much maneuvering to get their characters into the right crucial positions around the Antichrist, that there's almost no time left for the story.   I was amused by the authors' description of the Two Witnesses and their miraculous protection by God.  If God could do that sort of miracle, why hasn't he been doing it all along?  A few incidents of such miraculous protection of missionaries would have sufficed to convert millions in countries like China and Japan, not to mention unbelievers in the U.S. Instead, missionaries sent to non-Christian nations have routinely been killed or expelled.  Why would God permit such a thing?  Does He want people to go to Hell?  Rabbi Ben-Judah's speech in "Tribulation Force" about how he's changed his mind and decided that Christ is in fact the Messiah struck me as absurd.  The Bible prophecy that "a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son" does not even appear in the original Hebrew of the Old Testament. The Hebrew word translated as "virgin" would be more correctly translated into English as "young woman."  "Virgin" is nothing more than an ancient mistranslation that has been copied and recopied over the centuries.  As for the rest of the 109 prophecies that the Rabbi claims were fulfilled by Christ, to say that Jesus Christ is the only person who could fulfill them is silly. Most of the Biblical prophecies of the Messiah are vague; with many, it's hard to say whether they even deal with the Messiah or not.  The Book of Isaiah has many of these prophecies, and it can be mighty obscure.  As we have very little solid evidence for Jesus' actual life history, it's very difficult to know if he actually fulfilled any prophecies. Certainly his followers wanted to think he did, and accounts written by his followers are the only ones we have.  The power of wishful thinking is often underestimated, in my opinion.    The "Left Behind" series takes prophecy in general much too seriously.  The Book of Revelations is essentially a collection of predictions, mostly of disasters, worded in highly symbolic language. This is the same trick that Nostradamus used in his prophecies. Since the language is so symbolic, the predictions can be applied to nearly anything. Wait long enough and bad things are, of course, sure to happen. Vague disaster predictions therefore tend to come true all the time. Since the day Revelations was written, people have popped up constantly claiming that now, at last, the predicted events are all happening, and Christ's kingdom is at hand. Is the Rapture coming this time? I don't think so. Are we likely to have some bad times ahead? Yes, but not because God planned it that way. It is humans who are now causing the biggest disasters.  As an atheist, I find the fundamentalist brand of Christianity, which loves to focus on the Rapture, even less appealing than the more ordinary kind. Fundamentalists seem to assume that "God will provide" and that we don't need to think about humanity's future.   If Christianity really worked to make bad people good and good people better, I would be the first to sign up. If Christianity was an effective way to relieve poverty and bring peace, I would definitely consider it. If Christianity were just a silly hobby that made people feel good and harmed no one, it wouldn't bother me. Unfortunately, that isn't what I see. Even when in power, Christianity has made little or no progress in solving the social problems that it deals with, such as poverty and violence. Christianity systematically ignores the most serious problems of our times: overpopulation, exhaustion of resources, and pollution, among others. Why does Christianity ignore these problems? Because they receive little or no attention in the Bible, a book written thousands of years ago.   If you are inclined to believe in the Rapture, I beg you to at least consider some contrary viewpoints. Christ said He would come as a thief in the night. Consider the possibility that He might not come for 500 more years, or 1000. Remember the parable of the talents. Do you want to face Him having ruined the planet He gave us to live on? As far as other fiction, I would suggest Heinlein's book "Job: A Comedy of Justice," which takes belief in the Rapture to its logical conclusion.  
 I thought the decorating ideas in this book were TACKY! I would never use any of them in my home. I got the feeling this author was on a publishers "payment due timeline" and had no idea about the inside of a home. Martha really has raised the bar. This book was a disappointment 
 I purchase books online based on the reviews so lets be honest.  Debby DuBay's book Antique Limoges at Home is the book to purchase.  Gaston's book has terrible photographs & just can not compare to DuBay's books 
 the only reason I got this book is because it was in the Oprah's book club. I was sorely dissapointed. The story felt slow and disjointed to me. And my prevailing feeling at the end was "so what". That it was supposed to be a love story did not interest me. The sentiments expressed did not move me at all, it seemed very ordinary, almost everyday. But who knows, probably an everyday, ordinary sort of life story is what some people want to read so they can identify with- god forbid 
 This book is very similar to what is known as a 'review of the literature' found in academic journals. The Crash was first and foremost a financial event but Klein does not really address finance other than to survey what people thought. I get no feel for what may have caused the Crash nor do I walk away feeling educated about the period. It has all been done better before, namely Galbraith and F.L. Allen in their own way. Historians need to know more finance before tackling this topic which is why Klein does not succeed 
 This book reads like Ms. Bright invented not only sex, but pithy observations.  My own diary is more insightful than this self-important tome.  Do yourself a favor and buy something else 
 Whoa...this parfum was way too strong for my taste.  I'm wondering if I was even sent the wrong product.  I read the rave Amazon reviews and I thought the price was reasonable, so I thought I would give it a try.  This parfum smelled so strong and loud, I gave it to my boyfriend!  I hated it...I prefer light fresh or sweet floral smells, and this parfum smelled heavy and musky, even masculine.  One spritz is enough.  Two is overkill.   I personally wouldn't recommend it, to a woman or man 
 It is handy to have such a tremendous number of quick breads in one book; this one has more recipes for quick breads than all my other cookbooks put together. Just flip to the chapter you want and leaf through all the recipes until you find one that suits you.  Unfortunately, I am not confident enough in the reliability of the recipes as a whole to recommend it. Interesting, but best avoided.    The author claims to have tested each recipe, but I doubt the veracity of this statement. It almost seems as if this book did not have an editor at the publisher. This is definitely a case where quantity trumps quality (I would be happier with fewer but higher quality recipes, but then you probably would not have a 1001 of them, either).   In the muffin section: 1) it is humorous to see basically the same recipe 500 times 2) the batter measurement and/or yield information is often wrong 3) each recipe has a picture, but many pictures are either wrong or next to the wrong recipe 4) textures ranged from pasty to dry to undercooked 5) few recipes worked correctly 6) sub-division of this long section would have been helpful: sweet vs. savory, flour vs. whole grain vs. biscuit mix, mix and dump vs. whipped egg whites, etc. 7) author uses 4 different muffin pan sizes, seemingly at random (the sizes are: 2.0, 2.25, 2.75, and 3.0 inches diameter).  8) many recipes are wrong: missing ingredients, missing recipe steps, incorrect ingredients.   9) the yields go all over the place, ranging from 3 muffins to 4 dozen; would it have been that much trouble to standardize all the recipes to yield 6 or 12 muffins using one size muffin tin? 10) the recipe names are not consistent: some muffins that use cocoa powder are called "chocolate muffins", while others are called "cocoa muffins".  11) the amount of baking powder seems to be excessive in many recipes.   12) some of the ingredients make no sense: "lecithin granules" (fyi: 1 teaspoon of lecithing is enough for 20 -40 pounds of product)? 2 T of "dried grated orange zest" for only a dozen muffins (perhaps the author is thinking of candied orange peels)? 13) muffins with egg and fat only, no liquid 14) a majority of the recipes have one or more whole grain ingredients, so if you want a muffin with just plain, old flour, your choices are limited (many of the recipes seem to be cribbed from cookbooks from the "health concious" 70's and early 80's).    I have similar complaints about the inconsistency and sloppiness of the other chapters in the book (here, I am referring to the editing and recipe quality, not the mess it makes in your kitchen). Consider, for example, mixing methods. The one used for muffins is perfect, the one for biscuits is wrong, and the one for coffee cakes is hopelessly confused.  Page 295 has the ingredient "Whipped Cream Topping (see recipe page XXX)"; good luck trying to find it, because it is not listed in the index and I am not flipping through 480 pages of recipes to find it.  Contrary to what the author states on page 307, the origin of what we know today as "quick bread" is English high tea, not holiday celebrations.  Many of the quick bread recipes did not have enough liquid; they make adequate substitutes for gypsum board, but were not suitable for human consumption (I would love to make a joke about even the dog not wanting to eat them, but I do not have a dog).  It is also the only cookbook I know of that calls for distilled spirits in generous quantities as a baking ingredient, from 1/2 to 1 cup of rum, brandy, kirsch, creme de cacao, etc.  The quick breads come out of the oven looking and tasting like masonery bricks. Most of the scones I tried looked and tasted like hockey pucks.    It has chapters on muffins (236 pages), biscuits (18 pages), cobblers (6 pages), doughnuts (10pages), quick breads (118 pages), pancakes (10 pages), popovers (6 pages), scones (28 pages), and waffles (12 pages).  In general: 1) in each chapter, the recipes are arranged alphabetically by title 2) index is correlated by ingredient only 3) a master list of all recipes would have been helpful 4) index needs to be cross-referenced by recipe title, not just ingredients 5) does not specify how flour is measured (scoop and sweep, spoon and sweep, etc.)    
 When I found "Hour Game" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, I thought I had hit pay dirt.  But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as "The Winner" and "Absolute Power" could turn out such a dog.  Long, boring, and confusing.  I fear that Mr. Baldacci hired an "aspiring young writer" to "help" him crank out a quick book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't do that to them.  It will be tossed into our blue recycle bin.  What a waste.  What a shame. 
 I purchased the above product in 2006.  I opened the package and used them in 2007.  After they were washed twice I found that it was virtually impossible to get them to fit on the bed.  They shrunk so much!  I have regular king size pillows and cannot even get the cases on the pillow.  I tried to return these, but was told that I purchase them too long ago, and I could only get 50% back and I would have to pay for the shipping.  I think the company should stand behind this product.  I have much less expensive sheet sets and this did not happen to them.  DO NOT BUY, NO WORTH THE MONEY 
     The title enticed me and I had high expectations to glean some insight into modern economic problems - or at least hear some different perspectives. The book is not a bad read, but it suffers from two continual errors that, as a scholar, I find really annoying. First, in many of the graphs presented, they are not numbered, cited in the text, associated with legends NOR are the axes labelled. The trends are obvious, of course, but I had no idea what the heck I was looking at. There is also a lot of jargon thrown at the reader without explanation.      Second, there are no references for many of the statements made in the book. It would be nice to know where they got their data or even IF they are making a claim based on real data (I assume they are, but without references, who knows?). You may like this book and, again, it's not a bad read, but I got so frustrated with the shoddy scholarship that I just set it down halfway through and gave up. I really don't care to listen to opinions as much as I enjoy examining positions and arguments... and those require some scholarship whereas anyone can throw out an opinion 
 i think Susan Sontag is missing the political nature of illness.  as far as i'm concerned there is a culture of blaming the victim in our society that is not limited to medicine.  the victim is blamed because the victim has little power.  the ill person is blamed because the tobacco companies are powerful, the oil companies are powerful, the sugar companies are powerful, the retail chains are powerful, the manufacturers are powerful, the health insurance companies are powerful and the governments are powerful.  they have armies of lawyers to defend them; they have armies of doctors, scientists, and psychiatrists to fabricate pseudo-scientific evidence to support their self interest, but the victim is powerless to defend themselves against blame.  this isn't about language, it's about politics of money and power.  language is only one of the tools that the powerful use to blame the ill, and victims more generally 
 This novel started out pretty good in that I didn't know where Koontz was going with Martie's panic attacks and fear of herself.  It seemed to take FOREVER for anything to actually happen. The antagonist was a caricature.  So over-the-top, it was a job getting through each page. If this had been my first Koontz novel, I probably wouldn't bother with a second. 
 Other reviews give a good sense of the concretes of this book, so I'll just mention what struck me as the fundamentals:  the characters (and I do mean all of them) are pathetic: thieves and murderers; the setting is a dark, pointless future containing not a single real person with a real life; and the plot feels like a confusing tumble down a well.  Although Gibson is intelligent and quite creative, he seems to enjoy creating difficult, jargony prose (muddying the waters so that they appear deep?).  If this is one of the best in the cyberpunk genre, then the genre is not for me 
 I very much enjoyed Prof. Halperin's early book, *Before Pastoral.*  There, his familiarity with classics and with the pastoral and bucolic traditions led to insightful observations about important literary modes, their definitive characteristics, and their evolution.  Unfortunately, *Saint Foucault* is symptomatic of a problem that has been plaguing English departments for some time now:  English professors dismiss their primary object of study---literature---as "bourgeois" or "elitist" or "oppressive" or "economically superstructural," and they become dilettantes in a mish-mash of fields that they end up calling "cultural studies" or "cultural poetics." As his work was received in North America, Foucault had a great deal to do with that shift in English studies. Nonetheless, I do find it amusing that Halperin can create an only half ironic "cult of personality" around the very man who argued that the category of the individual "subject"  was infinitely less important than a transpersonalized, discursive and ultimately ill-defined "POWER/KNOWLEDGE." Whatever my serious reservations about Foucault's ideas may be, I know for sure that he would find the idea of a "gay hagiography" very unsound.     
 I love to read, and have all my life.  I don't know how I escaped reading "Mary Poppins" as a child, because I read nearly every other children's classic book.  I decided to read this aloud to my children precisely because I hadn't read it.  I was horrified as the book went on...if this Mary has a heart, I can't find it.  You'd have to use a microscope to find it.  Yes, there are strange adventures that are interesting.  I don't have a problem with that.  My problem is Mary  herself. She's nasty and mean, and there isn't one redeeming quality about her in the book.  I found myself disliking her more and more as the book went on.  Perhaps I was tainted in my viewpoint by the Disney version. But I'll gladly take that version, for once, over the book.  At least in the movie Mary could crack a smile and actually enjoy something.  In the book she's as friendly as a block of ice.  Watch the movie.  Forget the book 
 I give it two stars only because the two mystery's are decent.  This is some of the worst writting I have found in a long time of reading.  The dialogue is totally unrealistic and the writing is awful.  I don't know how much Patterson had to do with this book but he should be ashamed.  I ask you  how many women do you know that use a term like "skirt hound" for a man who chases women?  I actually listen to this book as an unabridged audio, thinking it would sound better than it read...silly me!  It was even worst because I had to hear the actor read the awful dialogue.  Even my wife, who is a big Patterson fan, disliked this one 
 This book was interesting at first.  It shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like, but that only takes a chapter.  After that, it just keeps repeating itself over and over.  "Who do you think bought the $1000 watch and who bought the lower priced watch?"  Yeah, yeah, I get it; the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending, no real wealth guy.    Then some of the examples are so over simplified or exaggerated that you know they are made up to make a point.  I want real examples.  I don't care if you give them goofy code names to protect identity, but don't come up with such bad comparisons to prove a point if it isn't real.    Then there is the advice on being frugal.  I am pretty frugal, but some of what they said would put me in the crazy house if I had to live like that.  Sure, I could cut out every unnecessary expense from my budget, but then I wouldn't be very happy.  Who cares if I have a million when I'm 60ish if I had to live miserably up until then.  What is that worth?  I know not to go out and buy a brand new luxury car, but driving around my 20 year old Jeep is no fun either!  This book is good for the first chapter and if you are just completely clueless or a compulsive over spender.  People with common sense need not buy this book, just check it out at the library like I did 
 This movie is watchable, but barely. Its not on the same level of the other chainsaw versions....and see leatherface as a....never mind, youll have to see for yourselves. We have a yound Renee Zellweger in this one.  
 When I received this set it contained no Disk #2 and 2 Disk #5s. I have e-mailed the seller to see if they will rectify the situation and I'm waiting for their response 
 To use a Mets phrase, "It's amazing" that Jeff Pearlman can make a living focusing on the dark side of people. Baseball players are people - period. They have talent to swing a bat, run, throw a ball, but this does not make them enlighted, beyond temptation or anymore newsworthy than my father, an insurance executive who drank too much, was abusive to his family and as great as he was at work, could have been so much more.   This team is a microcosm of the real world and there are companies out there that make the story of the 1986 Mets pale in comparison.   Yes, Gooden and Strawberry could have been Hall of Famers, but they were strong at baseball and weak at life. This makes them human, not tragic.   We do love to put people at pedestles, simply to knock them off and watch them fall.   The 1986 Mets are my favorite team of all time. They had heart and they went into the season with the highest of expectations for them, and won.   What more did you really want from them?  Spend your money on a book with an ending that you don't already know. 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 She seems to have been heavily influenced by both azuza street crowd i.e. much of today's pentecostalism/charasmatics i.e. the toronto/brownsville blessing (a history which is fraught with charlatans and very biblically problemic) and hollywood.   In studying many of her sermons what is readily apparent is the lack of any solid biblical understanding or doctrine. It was just get saved and jesus loves you. A cozy accomodation to the masses who can pretty much define that jesus they want to believe in and then follow.  
 The Wisdom of Menopause provides an accurate description of what happens to a woman's body during and after ovarian failure (menopause). This book describes in detail the negative effects of menopause (ovarian failure) while still describing it as a natural and normal process to embrace. I don't believe we should be so willing to allow our ovaries to fail, instead we should look for ways to help them work better and for longer. 
 This is a fast-paced book with all the formulaic elements required of a political thriller. Nothing here particularly surprised me. I would guess that if you have enjoyed Mr. Flynn's other works you will enjoy this one as well.  Mr. Flynn needs a more assertive editor. His use of language is so sloppy as to distract a reasonably sensitive reader from the finer points of the story. This probably isn't detrimental to the reader's comprehension, but it is irritatng.  Finally, one very minor quibble: non-standard spellings are used throughout (such as "harken" rather than "hearken"). This may or may not matter to any given reader, but I found it to be worthy of mention 
 What a disappointment! The music quality is very poor--most of the "intruments" sound just like every other cheap kids electronic toy.  The piano is probably the worst; the animal voices all sound the same. I thought I'd get better quality at the price, plus, the left speaker doesn't work.  My kids had a toy casio keyboard that cost $12.00 and was the size of an egg-carton, and its sound was vastly superior. I will likely have to go through the hassle of returning this. 
 This book is a fairly good introduction to Jefferson, although it is rather short for a biography of one of our most intelligent presidents.  The book seemed to quickly skim over his life, for example giving only one chapter to each of his presidential terms.  The Lewis and Clark expedition is barely mentioned and I would have liked to know everything that led up to that famous journey.  His scientific achievements are also only alluded to during the course of the book.  Although it is an easily readable book, I came away wanting to know much more and feeling I did not know the man.  Compare this to the excellent John Adams: A Life, and this biography falls well short.  If you want a short summation of Jefferson, then this book will suffice 
 I really do not know why this is in it's 10th edition or on it's 25 anniversary.  I purchased the book thinking it would be a useful introduction to the benefits of incorporation and guidance for the benefits / drawbacks to each form of corporation.  The discussion is more suitable for someone with significant exposure to corporate structure who is looking for fine tune their strategies - perhaps an accountant or a tax attorney.  While I (a physician) could often understand what the author was trying to communicate, I found her approach confusing 
 This book would only be tolerable if you like romance novels, but in that case you'd be better off buying "The Notebook". - This book has no practical business value at all. I find its popularity to be deeply troubling. There is apparently something in the current business culture that makes people not want to think. They just want to feel good. The story presents "facts", but no sources. It presents inspiration, but no critical thought, and it doesn't prepare the reader for the real challenges that they will face in life or in business. Rather then presenting Vision from the appropriate management perspective, it presents it from a marketing perspective. This is how we want the public to feel about Vision. - Even from the viewpoint of `inspiration' it fails, because it's fictional. ANYONE can succeed in fiction. No 
 When I bought this book I was hoping the author had a cogent understanding of both physics and psychology - unfortunately, here was neither. As another reviewer pointed out Zohar bashes Reductionism too much, eg. "For quantum physics really to come into its own, and to replace not just Newtonian physics but also the whole Newtonian world view ...." Of course, any responsible quantum physicist writing on this topic would never suggest replacing Newtonian physics because this is impossible! However, many do advocate for a greater share of cultural/scientific investigation and awareness be given to the quantum/system/ecological/holist/emergence perspectives. Then on the very first page of her book Zohr calls for "... a new, quantum mechanical theory of consciousness...." A mechanical quantum theory? This is a contratiction of terms! Also, her pyschology is uneven and inaccurate. While I admire her spirit and intent for writing this book, I was very disappointed with the material and I would not recommend buying it. I think there are better books on the market about these areas of thinking 
 Sondheim is regarded as being a "musical genius" but I would strongly disagree. While his music is certainly complex (bordering on chaotic), he has yet to evoke any emotion or passion in his music. His melodies are pretty, witty, complex or intellectual. Never gorgeous.   With that said, Sweeny Todd is definitely his best work. There are a few good numbers in here. "Joanna" is a pretty tune and so is "Not While I'm Around" but, again, not gorgeous. My personal favorite has always been "Kiss Me", a lyrically witty love declaration between the two young lovers.  Everyone always criticizes Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, which, in my opinion, is often luscious, sweeping and dramatic. It evokes the days of Puccini and even Rogers & Hammerstein. I'll admit Andrew Lloyd Webber is far from brilliant and he is famous for using the most insipid lyricists in the history of musical theatre, but Sondheim's music is incapable of approaching the gorgeousness of Webber's work. Now I will say that if you attend a Sondheim musical, you're in for an intellectually stimulating experience.  Just because music is intellectual does not mean it's wonderful. Sometimes intellectual is just that. When I go to the theatre, I want to be moved, not quizzed. Sondheim needs to learn how to compose melodies that, at least, follow some form or structure and don't simply drift off into A-tonal murkiness. An audience can't be expected to cry or experience emotions if the music isn't lifting them or taking them anywhere.   On last thought... Phantom of the Opera is the longest running show on Broadway...and there's a reason! It's moving. You'd have to have a heart of stone not to be moves by the sweeping melodies. You can point out all of the show's shortcomings but you cannot deny that most of Webber's score is gorgeous. No matter who you are, if you go see Phantom of the Opera you will be moved. You could also see Sweeny Todd on Broadway and find it interesting and amusing. To say the least, you'll walk out of the theatre thinking, "Wow I was just intellectually stimulated! ALL RIGHT!"...and that's about it.  Webber's music IS musical theatre, Sondheim's music is like a sea of watercolors that bleeds into a murky mess 
 Succinctly put, this is probably the worst science fiction book I've read, and I've read a lot of them. I'll go point by point:  1: The idea. Some may call this novel "innovative," but that is most certainly a misuse of the word. The main idea of this book is that "incest" as we now use this word is ok as long as it either 1) genetically harmless; 2) failing the first condition, does not produce babies. Incest and other such "alternative family relationships," as another reviewer so mildly put it, is not a new idea at all. Now, I am not close minded to anything, but the sort of self-serving and constant glorification of what is ultimately a bad idea even biologically speaking that Heinlein subjects his readers too is boring, unimaginative, uninformative, and frankly morbid.  2: The plot. Nonexistent. There is no dynamic to the story. Heinlen meanders from one time-frame to another with no logic to tie them all up. There is an interesting story here and there, but they serve no meaningful purpose, except to, again, glorify (and not simply justify) "alternative family relationships."  3: The characters. I haven't found any. At least none that were really interesting. There is Lazarus, who is basically a sleazeball who is rules by his two cardinal instincts entirely: survival and reproduction. There are women, who are uniformely and without exception ruled by only one of those two instincts: reproduction. Others in the book are basically filler material.  4: The writing. Atrocious. Heinlein puts too much faith in dialogue. I say too much because he can't write it. All dialogues are protracted and artificial, they are never to a point, and they all sound alike. The last point bears repeating: you can almost never tell whose speech you are reading, except when 1) someone says they want Lazarus' baby (this happens often and it's a clue that a female character must be speaking) or 2) someone reminisces about the days of yore (that's a clue to Lazarus). But the style of the speech is the same for everyone.  5. The science fiction. Nonexistent. There are references to "rejuvenation," "time travel," and space colonization. But that's about as far as we get. There is absolutely no elaboration on how, for instance, a ten-fold increase in lifespan would have affected the reproductive choices of humanity. This is particulaly puzzling since all characters in the story are of such extraordinary verility. Put two and two together: if all women have babies every year or so, and all of those babies live for a thousand years each, how long will it take you to overpopulate a planet? The answer is: hardly any time at all. Yet Heinlein never pauses to explain how the economies of his worlds continue to function and never stops to elaborate on the causes of social collapses that do happen from time to time.   Last thing. Why did I spend all this time writing a review. Because I find it troubling that so many give this book 5-stars. This is not a worthwile read. If you are interested in romance novels, go to a different section: Heinlein is probably not the best in that genre. If you are interested in science fiction with well-developed ideas and good fiction, pick up Asimov, Greg Bear, Stephen Baxter (bad writing but great science), John C. Wright, Will McCarthy, or Vernor Vinge 
 Some of the recipes are healthy, some are a good way to get quick sick. If it were just J.R. and his recipes and food pics, okay, but no, on the cover is a picture of two famous women who help glorify violence and who act lascivious in front of the world and on the cover. This book glorifies the WWE, and the WWE glorifies violence and sensuality. It's also an insult to women. Anyone claiming to be a Christian, do not support this book, don't be a hypocrite, "Be perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect." - Jesus 
 A weak freshman effort from the earliest Jefferson Starship iteration, DRAGON FLY suffers, as many J. Airplane/"Solo"/J. Starship/Starship albums do, from overproduction.   This band, in whatever form its taken, has always loved its multipart harmonies and heavy instrumentation. When the formula works it works very well, but when it doesn't, the music tends to have the dissonant sound of rush hour gridlock in Manhattan. And although the Jefferson Airplane "broke up" in 1972, the early Seventies saw a slew of various solo projects by various band members come to fruition, the overall quality of which were uneven. To be fair, it's difficult to write good material consistently, and the more prolific the writing, the more throwaways are created. It's clear that Kantner, Slick, Balin, et. al. all needed individually to take some real time off to find new directions for themselves. The early Seventies albums all seem to be retreads of each other.   So it is with DRAGON FLY. Most of this album consists of eminently forgettable songs with weak lyrics. The band's densely insistent musical aggressiveness does not lift any song on this album up to the status of a true "hit." The best song on the disc is far and away "Ride The Tiger," a piece which would otherwise qualify as a secondary choice on any Greatest Hits compilation.  The only other pieces of note are Grace Slick's "Hyperdrive," overly long and prolix but potentially a good "live" suite; and "Caroline," 'guest star' Marty Balin's lengthy ode to lost love, which anticipates "Miracles" on RED OCTOPUS.   Overall, DRAGON FLY is an unimpressive entry from a "new" band of the 1970s that had played themselves out being an "old" band from the 1960s.

 The sizing on this cardigan is way off.  I ordered a women's medium and it looks like a child size large.  The sleeves are about 4" too short and the overall profile is far too small.  To make matters worse, I ordered it as a X-mas gift and by the time we opened presents we passed the 30 day return window and I'm stuck with a bad product 
 The prefatory note states: " Mr. Murray wishes to point out that this book is written in English by a native of Japan." It definitely shows.  This book is indigestible. Here is an example:  "Imitation, whether of nature, of the old masters, or above all of self, is suicidal to the realisation of individuality, which rejoices always to play an original part, be it of tragedy or comedy, in the grand drama of life, of man, and of nature." Another example:  "But, alas!  In a world so worldly, no such dreamland could long persist!" If you can get past the style, you find this book is just an accumulation of historical facts about India, China and Japan. The last sentence:  "Victory from within, or a mighty death without" tells you all you want to know about this book:  Don't buy it 
 Meanwhile a lot of other people written very good books in a very different stile: Suzanne Clothier (Bones would rain from the Sky) Patricia McConnell (The other end of the Leash) Turid Rugaas (Calming Signals)  We have three Irish Setter and we prefer a soft method for our dogs 
 'Advances in Agronomy, Volume 73', left me bewildered. Nowhere in the text did I find reference to the well-researched fact that those who practice agronomy, and who have been convicted of it, are usually recidivists who can never be rehabilitated. So therefore, how has the topic been advanced? Society should be protected from agronomists and their vile deeds. I might sound harsh, but I say that all agronomists should be locked up for life and rendered hormonally inert through the administration of impulse-destroying chemicals. 
 Alexander Pope was not of the Romantic period, and any book that thinks he was can be no guide to a GRE Subject Test.  This alleged prep text splits hair in nanometers over interpretive questions, asks for identification of the most obscure passages, and frequently explains why B was the right answer, and why A, C, and D were wrong, but leaves that status of E wholly to the realm of mystery.  The practice test sent out with the GRE registration is different in scope, clarity, and difficulty.  I actually tore out a chunk of this book with my teeth in frustration.  Don't buy this book.  Don't even steal it.  Spend the money on deluging the publisher with demands to remove it from the shelves and issue written apologies to anyone who ever suffered themselves to use it 
 I originally picked up this book because it seemed like it had gotten some decent reviews.  I can't stay that I enjoyed the novel very much, mostly because it was slow moving, the characters were all over the place, and the ending was weak.  Don't waste your time reading this novel, pick up something better like The Kite Runner, which has a lot more substance 
 Lt. Bak while undoubtedly an interesting character does not have a very interesting story or plot in which to reveal himself. The story is lacking in description and constantly refers to the smells of Egypt - such as  manure. Too much detail is put on the shipping trade and not enough into  the characters and depth of the characters in it. It lacks color,  emotion,depth and does not transport one to Egypt as do most of the novels  I have read 
 I cannot believe the high marks for this book. This book purports to be a management manual and a historical view of Alexander's life. It is quite mediocre on both fronts. The historical side is full of inaccuracies and the management side is far too simplistic to have any real value. If one is interested in reading about Alexander's military genius I would recommend The Generalship of Alexander the Great J.F.C. FULLER 
 First, I hardly ever write reviews...but after this story, I needed to state something.  Second, I am not considered a conservative and relatively open minded. Third, I always appreciate history and culture...and understand this story was handed down through generations.  However, never reading this story myself and reading it to my three and a half year old for the first time - I had to stop half way through the book after realizing the heart of the story surrounds a monkey killing a baby owl and the jungle searches for the killer while the mother owl grieves.  To complement the story, there is an illustration of the monkey (snarl showing sharp teeth) hitting the baby owl over the head with a branch...not a bedtime story for this family.  It was given as a gift, and will be returned shortly.. 
 `"I'm of course aware that some believe that Herta von Walther played the Dietrich role in the Garbo film Die freudlose Gasse, "The Joyless Street",' so writes Diana McLellan.  Despite the author's claim that Marlene was in Pabst 's "The Joyless Street," there is absolutely no evidence that any actress other than Herta von Walther played the part of the woman in the butcher line.   McLellan certainly has no proof that Marlene played the part. Therefore any thing she says about her in that role is opinionated speculations.   There is, however, much evidence that Herta von Walther was in that role.    Marlene and Herta did appear together in one film in 1923, Tragï¿½die der Liebe.  There is no evidence that Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich ever appeared in any films together.   The fact is that Herta made four films with the director of The Joyless street between the years 1925 and 1928. The four are Joyless Street, Secrets of a Soul, Love of Jeanne Ney, Abwege.   There is no record of director Georg Wilhelm Pabst having ever made any films with Marlene Dietrich 
 I decided that I had to write a review about Newsweek this morning, after I came across yet another biased, over-hyped cover story. This particular one is entitled, "Rethinking the Marriage Crunch," and goes back on everything they presented 20 years ago about a woman's chances of getting married later in life. This was undoubtedly very easy for them to do as they probably had no evidence for their assertion the first time around, and neglected to have any on this occasion. I really think another reviewer's comparison to People is quite apt, but Newsweek also provides a reliably pro-sexual revolution and pro-sixties counter-culture take on almost every issue. Two years ago, we were made privy to another bit of front page sensationalism concerning "Infidelity Chic." Yes, it seems, according to their sources, spousal cheating is all the rage even though they argue, without even a hint of contradiction, that everybody still wants to get married as much as ever before. I find the magazine to be [...] as they offer opinion instead of news; theirs is a mission of persuasion. Overall, there is little of which to recommend this publication as it is geared for a readership of trivial people who possess the depth of a kiddy pool. 
 We bought this diaper pail when our newest baby arrived.  We had previously used a Diaper Genie, that we no longer had - it worked fine, but was expensive.  We decided to buy the Diaper Dekor because of the Odor Free Guarantee.  Don't buy it.  The guarantee or the pail! It stinks up the whole house with just one or two diapers in it.  We have kept it in the garage, and also outside.  Not convenient.  Refills are expensive.  And worse yet - my one year old can get DIRTY DIAPERS out of it through the top - or get the bag through the door in the front!!! Who designed this thing??? 
 I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled "This is a racist book disguised as a work of art."  It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, "The Confessions of Nat Turner," by T.R. Gray.  Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.    Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married.  Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional.  So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.  In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.  Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?  Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.  Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die.  That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.  What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.  Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.  If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of "Confessions."  But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia.  Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself.  His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching 
 I'm already somewhat intuitive, I get the gut feelings, chills, sick feeling when the thing being guessed about is negative, the sense that something is just wrong, or I'll have something come to me that won't make sense but will later on. These things are mentioned in this book, and for that I'm glad, as it will clarify what intuition means in that sense. However I feel the book may lead those less knowledgable of what intuition is and what it feels like and what it's good for to some wrong conclusions. The book goes down the road of new age beliefs rather than practical uses for intuition, the whole "you create your reality" stuff which does not have much to do with intuition. Intuition is that feeling that you "just know," creating your reality is what you focus all your thoughts on all the time and how your life forms around those. Not the same thing! Also it talks a LOT about doing 'readings' and about psychic stuff, leading one to believe that intuition is focused on others and on the far future, and I've found this to not be true at all. Intuition does not have to be premonitions or asking someone a bazillion questions to pull info out of them until they tell you what they want to believe.   Also, the exercises, Exercise 4 claims to be you using your intuition to make answers to a bunch of phrases, such as "a man's name." However, I've found that the list, my answers which I did not give much thought to, were not some random intuitive message, they were in fact many of my favorites. It asks you to choose a color...most people will be tempted to put down their favorite color, not some magical psychic message that has some huge meaning behind it. The book also asks you to take all your very abstract random responses to questions asked in the book and then apply them to a question of yours that is not even remotely related to those random responses you had, and to make up a response that foretells the future for that question. It's just like asking a magic 8 ball a question and getting a response. You know the answer and question don't actually go together.   It is unfortunate that this book is on the market, leading people to wrong ideas about what intuition is, how to use it, and what it can do for you. There are too many new age-y books that rely on quick thoughtless exercises that claim that everything all fits together in the large universe so everything MUST have meaning, however, think of this: if everything had meaning, even the shape of your bowel movement must have meaning, or the sounds your shoes make on the pavement have some magnificient meaning. That's what this book wants you to believe. It has nothing to do with intuition, it is disguised spiritual b.s 
 I brought this movie a couple of days ago and I was very very very disappointed. Don't waste your money on this movie 
 Product is hard to review because you sent me the wrong battery.  As of 1/29/07 it has not been taken off my credit card.  How would you rate my review 
 hard to set up and use. no directions and can't find anything on the web.  Would not buy if I knew this 
 Chabon's "Wonder Boys" was a fantastic novel.  Read it.  (The movie adaptation was also excellent.)  In it, professor and author Grady Tripp is writing a novel that runs to several thousand pages with no sign of ending.  He cannot control what does and does not go in or focus on a through-line.  Although only 656 pages, "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay" is Chabon's runaway novel.  If you are very interested in comic books, there is a good 200 page novel in there somewhere.  If you are very interested in World War II era Eastern European refugess and their lives in the United States, there is a good 200 pages of that in there somewhere.  But as it stands, they are not worth digging out of "Kavalier & Clay".  Chabon has done some excellent work and has been very successful.  And most authors have a great investment in their work.  But Chabon's editor needs to stand up more firmly.  In the meantime, read (or re-read) "Wonder Boys" 
 Aleksandra is obviously involved in the publication of this book somehow. Why this moron feels the defensive need to attack other reviewers is beyond me, and downright pathetic. Why do you have to call other people uneducated? Isn't the average reader allowed to post their opinions? You're a desperate loser and a pathetic excuse for a fellow human.   My wife and I bought this book last year hoping it would give us some basic answers to some very basic questions. I agree that the fertilization of a hamster egg is of little consequence to the average couple. We found our money was better spent on "Taking Control of Your Fertility." It offered us very basic information. We were pregnant the following month. Spend your money there. Don't listen to the agenda-pushing moron below!  
 I had a previous non-brand name digital tire gauge and it worked great but eventually died. I bought this one thinking it would be better. The first time I used it I couldn't get a good connection at all and it kept giving me multiple readings.  It also does not seem to keep the number on the display after the reading. It would disappear before i could read it fully. 
 For anyone looking to find a detailed resource on the care of betta splendens, this book is not for you. A great deal of space in this book is devoted to the history of the fish, how they fight with other males (there are even explicit pictures of this process, which I was certainly not interested in seeing), and how to breed them. The sections covering their care are woefully lacking - the page on diseases merely lists the ailments and then offers a recommendation for another book in which to find more information. The tone of this book also stunned me - it is apparent that the author thinks of these fish as a source of income rather than as pets. Mention is made of fish that are not "exciting or saleable," and how sub-standard hatchlings should be culled or disposed of. I was quite offended by this - even the most dully-colored betta could find a happy home somewhere! The only reason I'm giving this book one star at all is because there are a lot of beautiful photos inside. It looks more like a picture book than anything else, actually. Very disappointing 
 What a disappointment! The book deals with a key element of software development but unfortunately lets the reader down in so many ways! While the topics covered should have been useful, I suspect that the most common word in the book was "I" - as the author regales the use with instances where his apparently superior and hothouse intellect saved the day. Instead, a concise but generalised explanation would have done and been illustrative.  Similarly, the book is filled with torturous language and passages absolutely berefit of meaning; for example pg 107 "Now it's time to reflect on how simple TagBuilder is and how easy it is for clients to use. Is there a simpler way to produce XML? This is not the kind of question you can answer right away. Experiments and hours, days, or weeks of reflection can sometimes yield a simpler idea. I'll discuss a simpler implementation in the Variations section below. For now, I move on to the last step. " on page 111 we finally got to the above mentioned Variations section in the interim 40+ references to "I" and "WE".  Finally, the author appears so in love with refactoring and artistic code that I really believed he exceeded good practice and drove towards refactoring to the infinitely useless. Several scattered recomendations to constrain class size to 10 lines of code and recommendations on how do so completed the picture for me. Too many flowers and not enough Vulcan warriors would be a good summary.  Last year, I led a large team in succesfully completing 40 Million Euro of software. (Yes, the sale value as sold to the customers) and commercially, i am not sure I would have a place in my team for such a polarised thinker 
 What a let down. Besides the poor grammer and editing in this book; the story was a real let down. At times the biker stories gleamed some hope of it actually having some biker philosophy, but that is short lived. And the ending; well, suffice it to say I would not recommend this book 
 I was very dissapointed with this release I never thought Id see the day when Flex went commercial but it happened and it happened in the worst way this album is the absolute worst commercial garbage I have ever heard sure if your a commercial MTV radio rap listener this is a five star album But this is what id expect from some one like DJ Clue not Funk Flex. The only good track is the Biggie Tupac freestyle. Flex really let the underground heads down on this one because after listening to mixtapes 1,2 and 3 which are all clasics numerous times I have to say that this album is the most unlistenable piece of trash that I have come across in quite some time. Where you at Flex have those clothing endorsements and corporate sponsorships gone to your head GET IT TOGETHER MAN!!!!!! WE NEED YOU!!!!!! Peace to all of the real reviewers who are not afraid to speak their minds when an album truly sucks 
 By chance before picking this up I had just finished The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. It's a great "compare and contrast" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.  Both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. Heart published in 1940, and Castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s.   Both families are poor. In Castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. This is supposedly because they "don't know how to do anything". So instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. How charming! They are "eccentric", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. Only Stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of Cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. But he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. Even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum Topaz--striking poses.  Unlike the looming and grinding poverty of Heart then, the poverty in the Castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. Not so in America where Mick Kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at Woolworth's, and to a life of little hope.  In Castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. Two dashing young wealthy Americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. They throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant American style. Most of the remainder of the novel consists of Cassandra and her sister Rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being.   It's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. If your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you!  The reviews for this novel in Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Smith was obviously talented. Her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. I wish she had given Cassandra a little more ambition. 
 I bought the book thinking that it would be accurate and helpful in everyday conversation.   I feel that most of what I read is simply not factual.  As a person, I feel strongly that I would not want to tell anyone that I knew the author or was his friend.  maybe it is just that we come from different backgrounds and experience.  
 This is a weird book, written for an unclear audience.  Its apparent audience is people who want to get off roads on their own power but have no clue how to do this.   To help them, it has a chapter on "seeking challenges" that discusses rock climbing, mountain biking, river rafting, and other activities.  Oddly this comes *after* chapters on "planning a trip" and "getting equipped."  That's odd because I'd have thought that you would need to choose the activity before selecting equipment, but apparently that's not necessary.  The bulk of the book discusses 18 back country destinations in the US and Canada, about half of which are national parks.  The rest consist of national forests, state parks, and other kinds of units.   These range from the familiar (the Smokies) to the less familiar (Ouachita National Forest in Arkansas and Oklahoma).  These destinations aren't organized in any useful way around activities.  For example, the chapter on Monogahela National Forest emphasizes mountain biking, but that's not obvious from the title of the chapter or from the organization.  As a result, you have to read or skim everything to find anything.  The chapters also lack enough information to do anything.  For example, the chapter on Theodore Roosevelt National Park discusses a series of day hikes and weekend backpacks, none of which gets more than a paragraph.  That's not enough information to choose among the options, much less plan a trip. 		 The real strength of the book is the photographs, and these are great.  But you can find great photographs of the outdoors in many other books. 
 I was disappointed with this book. Rather than a behind the scenes look into the strategy and excitement of today's dealmaking, it is a look into the past (poorly edited)of several VCs really not relating to their current successes. Better historical perspective in "The Big Deal" by Wasserstein and better strategy in "Winning at M&A" by Clemente and Greenspan 
 This is the first Grafton book I've read, but I'm pretty sure it will be my last.  Simply put, this is the worst book I've read in the past year.  The plot is ridiculous: it centers around the murder of woman who is prostitute/porn star/water treatment plant worker.  The characters only exist as canned responses to the investigator's questions.  Critical clue are revealed in predictable fashion to achieve an utterly anti-climactic ending devoid of any epiphanies or suspense.  
 There is only one little problem with this book: the typeface is illegibly small, defeating the purpose of a book meant to be a field guide. It is without question the smallest typeface I have ever seen in a book. Even if you have perfect eyesight (I don't) it's a struggle to read it. For those who have less than perfect eyesight, this book should come packaged with a magnifying glass. Perhaps they made the type so small so the book could be of a pocketable size, but they only partly succeed in this: you need a pretty large jacket pocket to comfortably fit this 451-page tome 
 I read one of her book about a girl given a potion that gave her powers of earth, wind, sky and water.  It was well written and interesting so I gave her another shot with The Nymph King.  I was very mistaken.  In my opinion, it was not well written and stayed way way too long in the sex area.  Too much is too much.  M 
 I bought this scooter for my 2 year old granddaughter for her birthday.  I, unfortunately, bought it online.  She is tall for her age and looks more like she is going to be 3. It was disappointingly small when I opened the package.  Her legs are crunched when she sits on the scooter, the foot space is small, so I cannot imagine 3 year olds riding this toy.  However, I cannot imagine 18 month olds "driving" a battery operated vehicle with any degree of safety 
 All you'll get out of this book is that when slithering past people in a movie theater you should turn around so your rear end isn't in their faces.  Granted it is now hilarious to watch pay per view Boxing and count how many people are "crude" down in Las Vegas slithering by each other.    It was her "interpretation" of the times and it won't cut the mustard.  You're going to take on step forward and be declared "crude."  This is a 2004/2005 fact.  You're going to have to go through finishing school to even begin to comprehend that game that you are dabbling with in "being a lady."  There are only two that I am aware of, the first which is a DVD course titled, "Udefine U," and another that runs about 5000 dollars for a couple of days which top level executives are put through by their corporations.    Udefine U is about a hundred dollars.  These "ladies" can be spotted at a glance.  They walk a certain way.  When they reach for a glass on the coffee table they have a particular body movement.  I am sorry but reading a round of "Be nice to a guy on a date" won't do it.  The top level executive course is the only one that mentions you MUST eat with your silverware in the continental style now.  It is *Mandatory.*  The Udefine U finishing school will offer this as a choice to you.  I'll give the authoress this credit.  She IS the only one who nailed everyone with their rear end in everyone elses face making their way to their seat.  This isn't the important stuff.  Rear end or no rear end going in the wrong direction, you had better have the walk, and your fork must be in your left hand FOREVER.    This book isn't where you're going to be okay.  It is a read once and chuck.  The sooner you begin finishing school the better.  It'll take about a year I reason to break down old movement patterns and for a fact always as a norm use the fork in the left hand.    So buyer beware.  Worse is out there.  I spotted that nightmare at a Target.  Manners described as "And how about something cheerful to wear!"  (Many warm fuzzies that will only destroy a person trying to improve.)  The "You're cursed for even trying syndrome."  The odds are where you're trying to take this book to is going to notice you're not all that.  Go on.  Head on down to the Mandalay.  I'll be watching you enter the amphitheater for that boxing match.  Will having read this book clue me in that you are different from the ordinary boob?  No.  I'll then notice how you squeeze in past others to your seat.  I'll know that you're trying.  You at least bought this book 
 Who is fear mongering for political advantage now?  Let's try another more accurate introduction...  As the self-appointed savior of the planet, a perfectly PC and sinless Kennedy flies into Houston (burning Jet Fuel refined in the completely legal plant he sees below).  He purses his lips because he is upset that refining energy for the country requires emissions.  He is so pleased that he and his liberal brethren have been able to consume all the same things Texans enjoy - plastic, gasoline, natural gas, and electricity, in massive quantities and then leave their collective share of the pollution in Texas.  "Yuk!  That does not look anything like Martha's Vineyard where I romped in the surf with a silver spoon in my mouth!" he exclaims.  How dare those southern red-necks build a state more economically powerful than mine!  What is wrong with this idiot?  Did he just discover that we have refineries in Texas?  These plants are operating completely within the law, and have been doing so for decades, under both Democratic and Republican administrations.  They are vital to the economy and without them we would all starve and/or freeze in the dark!  If liberal Yankees like Kennedy are offended by the Houston Ship Channel I suggest that they stop using the products that come out of Texas.  In fact, any state that does not allow refining and drilling for oil and gas, onshore and offshore, should not be allowed to the use of any product derived from hydrocarbons.  Any other course of action is pure hypocrisy --- Liberals all want what the petroleum industry provides, they just can't stand Texas oil men.  This is industrial and regional bigotry and is obviously designed to scare people into voting the Dems back into power 
 Janette Hospital is my favorite author.  Her best books are 'Borderline' and 'Charades'.  'Oyster' is too hard to read. 'Due Preparations...' just does not astound like her early books do.  Seems knocked off just to satisfy a book contract or something and is not from the heart.  Still my favorite author though 
 How can you write a children's book on Great Moments in Baseball History and not include 1956 World Series Perfect Game! Don Larsen's World Series accomplishment was only recently matched by another former Yankee, David Wells!! What a terrific oversight 
 This book outlines ways in which current society neglects and relegates elders so that they become invisible at a time when they have something special to offer the larger culture. The author challenges the reader to think creatively about how care for elders can be provided in a more dignified way. I highly recommend this provocative book for anyone interested in changing the way society views aging, abilities and wisdom 
 It is time for the transgendered to stop being so in denial about autogynephilia. This is sexual desire for the idea of oneself as a woman. For males who become females, but who are not exclusively attracted to men, that is what motivates us. A very vocal group of closet cases has tried to make discussion of this concept off limits. But do we have to cooperate in that?   This book mostly takes the standard line stressing gender identity, where anyone who wants to be the other sex has that desire because the are similar to the other sex, at least in their gender identity. But that's not what motivated me. I had sexual desire for myself as a sexy woman. That Mildred Brown works with transsexual patients but cannot (or will not) discuss autogynephilia does not attest to her clinical insight.  I know this is hard to understand for the uninitiated (although if you are reading these reviews, are you really uninitiated?). If you don't get it, read Bailey's "The Man Who Would Be Queen." 
 I'm a professional psychotherapist. I got interested in this book after reading a recent article about how survivors of rape, torture and other violence in Sudan were being helped with brief narrative therapy. Learning about a fresh approach to a seemingly impossible therapeutic task inspired me. I decided to learn more about it. I'm afraid I didn't learn much from this book.  The book combines clinical examples with a murky, overintellectualized rehash of social constructivist theory. The theory seemed tedious and ultimately useless. The clinical examples were not particularly inspiring or enlightening. I guess I'll have to buy another book on this topic. This one won't remain long on my bookshelf.  T 
 I wanted to like this book, but honestly, I didn't find the kind of serious treatment of the important subject of the greeters ministry of a church. I would not recommend it for training greeters. Some of the examples in the book were strange if not fanciful. Like the directions about "how to hug someone who doesn't want to be hugged" or the greeter who was given a diamond ring by a guest. Try "Serving as a Church Greeter" by Leslie Parrott, Paul E. Engl 
 The Product itself feels solid enough. But that seems to be just an illusion. I tried getting Trigger Finger to work with Reason 3.0. I could get Reason to respond to inputs from the knobs and sliders. But the most important parts, the Trigger Finger's Touch pads, flatly refused to trigger anything, not even Reason's Redrum which this unit was supposed to work well with. After spending half a day trying to fix the problem using Egnima, the softwere that allows users to assign various MIDI functions to each of the control surfaces, I finally gave up and took this pruduct back for a refund. Maybe a seasoned MIDI user can get Trigger Finger to work as it should as the Egnima software is that, an Egnima. But, I have an old Yamaha PSR-410 MIDI compatible Keyboard manufactured well before Reason ever came into existence. It took control of Reason the moment I plugged it in and set it up in Reason's prefs.  So with that logged in may mental notes, I kind of expect something like the Trigger Finger to work right out of the box without any fuss or muss other than seting it up in Reason's prefs. To which it failed misserably at doing. So Trigger Finger gets one star out of me. Sorry M-Audio, better luck next time. 
 I found this book in my library and was attracted to the title, and then to the summary on the back of the book. I was very misled; nothing on the cover of the book stated the large religious aspect of the story. I personally was embarrassed by how these people seemed to want to do nothing to help themselves aside from asking God to fix things for them.   As for the story, I do think it was entertaining but also frustrating. There were so many characters and so many brief glimpses into a traumatic/important episode of each character's life that it was difficult to keep track of each and every one and to match each child with each adult with each relative with each friend, etc. There were so many characters that each one was not able to be developed very well. I would have loved to know more about Trudy and Mae's relationship. I did not feel a connection to Mae's grief like I had hoped (I too lost a baby). I was also frustrated over the lack of development of the Trudy/Bert reltationship; from simply reading the book and not assuming anything, Trudy appeared to be somewhat subservient to Bert...maybe to the world. She acted as she wished (with good intentions) and always seemed to be too ready to apologize.  I think that if this book was written with the focus simply on the two sisters and how they deal with both past and present hurts, or possibly including the relationship building between Trudy & Bert, each character could become so much more. The entire idea of the book is wonderful and poetic, but the story simply failed at taking me away and into the lives of the residents of Lake Emily. Unfortunately, this is a book I will soon forget and was full characters that I never had a chance to connect with 
 Pure trash.  Absolute nonsense.  Dr. Greer has embarassed himself.  Save your money 
 Sue Grafton has written many good books but this one is weak, weak, weak. Try 'A is for Alibi' or 'J is for Judgement'. They show off Grafton's writing talents much better 
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a "well isn't that contrite" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight.   Some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti-catholic. I think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book. Althogh, there are some kooks that think this book is about reality, instead of fiction,   A much more interesting book, in a similar venue (modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones), is Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Be forewarned, Eco's novel is a MUCH more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel. It is analogous to comparing cotton candy (Da Vinci Code) to a 12 course gourmet dinner (Foucault's Pendulum). Both will satisfy hunger, both are a type of food, but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling.  
 I picked up this book thinking I was going to get great inside dope on the secret service and a compelling plot. While Costello certainly includes some great nuggets here and there, overall he's more concerned about trivial, everyday occurances that don't advance the story. By the end of the book, I was left with a big "is that it?" feeling. Skip it or borrow it 
 Very little to work with here.  Covers everything, but with little detail.  For instance, there are only six pages in the book on sub-contractors. Search a little more and you can find a different resource that will be much more detail oriented.   
 First question: Did we really need another profile of Tony LaRussa, already the most over-exposed manager in major league baseball? Ever since he popped up in the early 80s, the media has fawned over his every move, evidently impressed by his ability to pull a double-switch and glower at the same time. Dude gets more ink than Brad and Angelina -- maybe they share the same publicist.  But if you're as big a baseball fan as I, it's only a matter of time before you succumb to the hype and purchase this universally praised account of (as the title suggests) three nights in August ... i.e., a feeble re-make of 'Nine Innings' spread out over three games so the writer won't have to concentrate as hard. I finished the book in two sittings, so I can't honestly sit here and say that it stank.  Or can I?  The central premise of the book is as obnoxious as its subject, namely the aforementioned manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, one Tony LaRussa -- attorney at law, in case you needed reminding. According to one Buzz Bissinger, LaRussa's an old-school throwback, a balls-out 'real man' in a baseball universe increasingly lorded over by timid 'thirtysomething' geeks who wouldn't know a jock strap from an iPod nano. Yeah man, those guys just sit in front of their computers all day, crunching numbers, but me, Tony L, I go by my gut! I've got 25 years of experience ovah heah, and I make my decisions the old-fashioned way! If the stats tell me to pull my starting pitcher, maybe I will, maybe I won't -- I'm going to walk to the mound and SMELL him first. Think those MBA Moneyball twerps know what a pitcher smells like? They don't even chew tobacco, mang.  Yeah, well, interesting theory. Trouble is, after taking cheap shots at such stat-head losers as Bill James and Theo Epstein, our man LaRussa gets praised for obsessively analyzing pitcher-hitter matchups. That's right -- the guy that every baseball writer hypes as a genius is making out his lineup cards based on some guy going 3-for-7 against Kerry Wood. What the *&^%? Per Bissinger, we shouldn't rely on statistics -- unless they're based on impossibly small sample sizes.   Another flaw in this anti-number, pro-intangibles screed is that we never actually see LaRussa go *against* his statistics. Seriously. I mean, if the whole purpose of the book is to illustrate that you have to look beyond the numbers and size up the player himself, shouldn't there be some instances where Big Tony plays a hunch that goes against all logic and pays off huge? or where T straightens out a player with a bad attitude, or picks up a guy in a slump? You'd think so, wouldn't you? Yet such instances are strangely absent.  Why? Because LaRussa's an arrogant jerk who doesn't relate to his players. Hell, he doesn't relate to his *family* either, as one of the book's better storylines makes plain. The book confirms the prejudices held against LaRussa by his detractors: namely, that he's a paranoid madman who micromanages his teams to defeat. This negative nutcase appears deathly afraid of *not* making a move, of being second-guessed by the press... or by himself, perhaps? Bissinger relates his relentless fretting about the #8 hitter on the opposing team possibly getting a hit, thereby allowing them to have their #1 hitter lead off the following inning. It's a mildly instructive bit of insider baseball, but LaRussa treats the issue as if he's launching the Market Garden offensive. Dude, it's the fifth inning and there's still fifty games to go! Pop a Paxil or bolt down some Jim Beam -- you're begging for this guy to relax!  But Big Tony never relaxes -- and his players never will either. Bissinger notes approvingly that LaRussa routinely expects his guys to play as if it's the seventh game of the World Series throughout the 162-game season. As such, his players are forever under the gun, terrified their manager's going to freak out when they fail to advance the runner to third, even if they're playing the Pirates in June. His players will always press, and ultimately, they'll always lose. That's another major flaw in the book: The author presents LaRussa as the ultimate authority on all things baseball, while side-stepping the little matter of his failing to win the big one. He's managed for 25 years and has won the World Series exactly once; he's also lost it on three occasions, getting swept twice. Fittingly, he lost the 2004 series to a team that famously embraced the very stat-conscious maxims that Bissinger aims to debunk. Chew on that, Buzz. (Blaming the loss on a late flight into Boston? Sell it somewhere else, bub.)  The writing, you ask? Let's just say that Boswell and Angell can rest easy. Bissinger's swinging for the fences (!) on this one, desperately throwing in highbrow references regardless of whether they fit. A spate of ill-placed phrases ranging from the Maginot Line to the Hammurabi Code culminates in the downright bizarre description of a blooper as "the kind of existentialist hit that would keep Camus or Sartre in the money." Overwrought much? I half expected to spot Vladimir Lenin Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers behind home plate. Add in a surprisingly irritating decision to italicize the phrase HIT-AND-RUN each and every time it appears -- imagine a Neil Young biography that wrote about all his FOLK ROCK BALLADS or a book on Bush that discussed the WAR ON TERROR -- and you have a sad case of a writer getting in the way of his own story. Bad Buzz, Bad.  What was that story again? Oh right, here it is: Tony LaRussa's a genius because he doesn't rely on statistics like those other guys, except when he does, and you can tell he's sharp because he wins, except when he doesn't.  Did I mention the author gives LaRussa a pass on the issue of steroids, even though Tony's teams benefited disproportionately from turning a blind eye to the problem? It just goes to show you: Never read a book recommended by Tim Russert, the man who ate Mario Cuomo 
 I had higher expectations when I purchased this DVD. I was not disappointed technically but I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the acting as a whole and with the uneven singing of Rachel York.  She couldn't seem to decide whether she wanted a pop, jazz, or traditional musical theatre sound.  Her voice was all over the place.  Furthermore, I found her character very annoying...she was screechy and not at all vunerable.  I preferred Kathryn Grayson's performance in the movie as she managed to be vunerable, witty, and charming, as well as screechy, demanding, and somewhat tyrannical.  Truly, I could barely watch this entire video and at the end I could have cared less if Fred and Lilli got together.  I think that was the most powerful statement for me. The production was acted (or directed) with a lot of mugging and so much of it was over the top.  Can today's directors PLEASE leave something for the audience to think about and figure out themselves?  Everything need not be a commentary! I wish I had seen Marin Mazzie because I heard she was incredible. Rent this before buying it or better yet do what I did and buy it used.  It hardly cost anything and that is what is it worth 
 There is not one receipe in this book that my doctor would approve. This is more of an Atkins book than what the current recommendations are for gastric by-pass patients. I'm returning my book 
 I started the Full series a few years back when I needed an Evanovich fix between Plum books. I loved the first 3, after that I can't say they have lived up to my expectations.  This latest is the worse of all, it reminds of the 180 page romance novels of the early 70's, you know the ones you'd 6 of every month in the mail? Juvenile and unrealistic, sorry Janet but this one is a stinker for those of us used to the great Stephanie Plum novels and even the Barnaby series. Lorelei King does her best, but even a great reader can't help this book 
 I really loved his movies. Back when there was actually a budget of more than six figures. I have tried to stay a true fan, and have watched all his films. Now they are coming out every 60-90 days and they are trash. He is nothing but a ghost of his former self. Direction stinks, production quality stinks, plot stinks. I'm sad he can't get a film done in the US anymore, with a major studio. Where have all our action actors gone? They are all retired or making third rate direct to DVD trash like this. I'm finished. I can't take it anymore. I thought Submerged was it for me, but I kept coming back....hoping. Seagal has another movie coming out in a month or two (Romania again, ugh). It'll be the first I ever missed. Bye Steven, and good luck 
 Disappointing cd, watered down, main-stream, bland, pop-country 
 Jack "Deuce" Cooper (Matt LeBlanc) is a minor league baseball pitcher who's got the goods, but no self-confidence. Instead of looking up Dr. Phil, the team manager decides that a simian teammate is just what strike-out Deuce needs for a boost. Enter Ed, a chimp who's got more talent in his elongated little finger than the whole team put together. Ed's antics, including scarfing down chocolate-covered bananas and pulling toupees off of bald heads, were all "aped" by men in monkey suits and animatronics. Unfunny slapstick makes this DVD a real strike-out.  Staci Layne Wilson Author of Staci's Guide to Animal Movie 
 I had Young Lay's "Black 'N Dangerous" confused with the collected works of noted cellist Yo-Yo Ma.  I was not amused 
 A director who has no idea how to film dance sequences? An important song transmuted into God knows what? Mis-casting galore? A female star without one iota of chrisma? (If she stopped 3 shows cold they must have been high-school productions!) This is...or should have been...about the struggle to not only get a job on Broadway but to hang-on to that which is starting to fade. The all important role of Shiela seems little more than an after thought. Turned into a silly love story (which doesn't even play!) it is merely sad. Sad...and very, very BAD!!!  (the one star rating is because I HAD to rate it! 
 This books was way too overhyped.  Upon purchasing it I was greatly dissappointed.  It does give an introductory crash course in some guitar theory, but a lot of its information is half assed.  The way that scales are presented is incomplete with only partial scales and very poor explanations of how the different forms within a scale link together that I would actually consider as being wrong.  A lot of the examples and techniques explained are stupid. Who cares how to play "Louie Louie" in a bunch of different ways, but I suppose that might get you started at finding chords in more than one place on the fretboard.  Nevertheless, this book is boring and incomplete. Buy something else 
 I was expecting simple daily meal plans and it was a lot of reading and recipes that are not always food items on hand.  I was really disappointed in the book 
 this item didn't help my toshiba laptop, but that's probably more the laptop's fault. the fans are faulty and overheat, like in every toshiba laptop. but the notebook cooler didn't help at all 
 I purchased a Cookshack smoker over 5 years ago and have experimented with it off and on.  While I realize that barbeque is more art than science, I have been frustrated by the lack of information on just how much wood to use with particular recipes.  I pre-ordered this book in anticipation of learning some secrets and tricks in the use of the Cookshack smoker.  I waited for more than a month for delivery of the book and upon receipt of it, I eagerly delved into it looking for answers to my many questions.      To my great disappointment, this book offered absolutely no information that I hadn't learned from trial and error.  How much wood should I use?  The book suggests that I consult the Cookshack Operator's Manual.  There are some general guidelines but the guidelines don't tell you what amount of wood works best with what amount of food.  Although I have had some delicious food from the Cookshack, if I am cooking for guests, I use my Brinkmann smoker as I am more confident that the food will be cooked to perfection.  The water smoker takes longer, but is more forgiving than the sealed, dry smoking Cookshack.       People who like to smoke fish will find 48 pages of recipes.  If you prefer beef or pork, the list is much smaller, 16 and 15 pages respectively.  There are also small sections dedicated to sausages, lamb and game.      In short, this is a book that should have been a digest for Cookshack owners and prospective buyers.  At best, it is a generic guide for smoking recipes.  It doesn't promote the product line and it isn't a worthwhile choice for anyone new to smoking foods 
 Recently, despite my recommendation of the Brother MFC-7820N, two of my clients decided to purchase the Brother MFC-8460N because of the faster print speed and legal-size scanning bed and, oh boy, what a mistake that was! Both customers have had almost identical problems; the unit doesn't recognize the paper tray intermittely and says 'no paper in tray' and the unit makes an annoying clicking sound just before and for several minutes after printing, copying or receiving a fax. That might be okay in a noisy environment, but in a home office or any place where it's reasonably quite this will drive you bananas. Brother tech support doesn't have a fix for either of these problems and so they shipped a refurbished unit, only the annoying clicking was slightly less noisy while the paper/paper tray (MP tray) issue has come back to haunt the replacement unit. My suggestion, go with the MFC-7820N or better yet, get a unit from another manufacturer because Brother does not seem to want to do the right thing which would be to replace this defective model with another model that doesn't have the engineering, design and/or manufacturing flaws that make the 8460N a lemon. I really wanted to give Brother a chance because I think that the 7820N is a terrific little all-in-one, but stay away from this unit 
 These trains are very neat and my sons loved them when we first got them.  They each have been through two sets with the same result...the water leaks out after you've had them awhile.  They are not worth the money.  I highly recommend investing in another train instead of the aquarium cars.  This was the first time my guys have been disappointed with a Thomas product.  
 This is not one of my favorite cook books.  There are no pictures and the recipies are odd.  Who would want to eat Oxtails with Chinese flavor?  The binding is not condusive to a cookbook 
 i read this book the reveng of the whale.it is about a huge sperm whale that attacks a ship that is trying to capturen it.they are trying to kill it beacuse of the sperm oil it has.they bring it back to land and sell it.i didnt like the book becase it didnt really have a main charecter.all it talked about is what the ship did and how they capiutur the whales.i also didnt like it because i thought it was going to have more action in it.most of the time ther just sailing and not really doing anything really exiting.it also dont really have a story line all it talkes about is what the ship is doing.it has no charecter conflicts.i was expecting more fights seenes with the whale and i would have hopped the would have discribed the whale better and how it attacked the ship more.some of the things i did like about it was it had one vwery god part in it.when the capterd one of the whales.it told how the got it and what they had to do to get it.i also like the pictures in the book it showed what the whales looked like and all the tools they had.i really didnt like this book but if you read it mabey you will u might be suprised 
 This electric blanket has the nicest texture of the last "five" electric blankets we have purchased. However it stopped working within a month, like the other four. Who makes a realiable electric blanket? Not Sunbeam and not this brand. Since the texture on this one is nice, we can at least keep it as an extra cuddling blanket 
 "The Mermaid's Chair" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, "The Secret Life of Bees".  A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina.  Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally.  Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped 
 I can't count how many glowing reviews I've read for this book.  I've come to the conclusion that those reviewers never actually read through the book.  Let me continue by saying that I got this book for a gift and, while I appreciate the thought, I feel awful about accepting it because it is hands-down, the worst book published since the dawn of Anglo-Western democratic civilization.   My first beef involves his name.  Susur.  Buddy, no one knows who you are so quit signing with only your first name.  Madonna is the only one that can get away with that, and even she is a washed-up hag.  The first "book" is just some pretentious blather about his life.  It's not even interesting.  No one had heard of this guy before he wrote the book, and that's because he hasn't done anything worth noting.  The actual recipe book is an abortion.  The recipes are all so incredibly complex, and require so much money that the only way someone is going to complete one is if they have: 1) too much time 2) too much money (you might actually have to sell your children to afford a recipe; I hear slave-trade brings in the most cash); and 3) Obsessive Compulsive Disorder  Now I consider myself a pretty able chef (The French Laundry is one of my favorites), but I'm pretty sure that even Iron Chef Morimoto would get acid reflux reading this book.  "Complex" doesn't even begin to describe the recipes.  Actually, I'm pretty sure that there isn't a word in any of the European languages that illustrate the preposterous amounts of effort required to complete a dish.  If I went to a restaurant that offered a menu such as the one in Susur, I would get up and leave, and return fifteen minutes later with a jerrycan of gasoline, and a tub of motor oil and I would burn it to the ground.   Cocoa Squab Liver Pate with Taro Fritters Egg and Caviar Creme Fraiche and Honey Mustard Sauce?  Puh-lease, if that doesn't sound like latent homosexuality, I don't know what does.  If you're too lazy to read the stuff I wrote above let me SUMMARIZE:  - I would pay more money to contract Hepatis C than I would for this book.  I hope this review was helpful 
 The book's structure, arranged by knowledge group (e.g. quality and HR) rather than by phase is not helpful and is the first of many problems with this text. Probably the greatest flaw is not emphasizing the inputs, outputs, and tools and techniques of each phase, which is a big part of the PMP exam. The book also goes into excessive detail in certain areas (e.g. EVA calculation) and ignores other very important areas that are part of the exam.  There are much better alternatives to this prep book. 
 ANANSI BOYS by Neil Gaiman Review by Nickolas Cook  	For those familiar with Gaiman's past work, like me, you've probably come to appreciate his intelligent humor, story telling ï¿½lan, and philosophical bent on the human condition.  With "Anansi Boys" he again proves all of those qualities and more. 'Fat' Charlie Nancy is the disgruntled son of the forgotten African god, Anansi (we met him in Gaiman's masterpiece to date, "American Gods"), a mischievous spider deity, who stole all of the stories of creation from Tiger, the dark and violent god of blood and death.  'Fat' Charlie receives news that his father has passed away and rushes from England to Florida to find his father was no mere human.  And as if that's not bad enough to ruin his day, he also discovers he's got a lost brother called Spider.  Given the incantation to draw his brother to him by a trio of old hags, much like MacBeth's cackling witches, he gets more than he bargained for when his impishly suave brother appears and begins to steal his life, his career, and his fiancï¿½ right out from under him. Gaiman does mythology like no other author, dragging us from one world to the next in search of honor and love, making the cosmic drama of gods more human.  But what he does even better is examine familial love and commitment to a calling higher than one's self.  For 'Fat' Charlie soon finds that he can't ignore his heritage anymore than he can his brother.  He is part of the pantheon, whether he fancies it or not, and, after a bargain made in angry frustration, must battle to save his bloodline from eternal death. Gaiman's prose is top notch, fast paced, edited to the essentials, with enough descriptive passages to make the story blossom in full, but not enough to stifle the pace.  There are some rather out of place scenes with the spirit of a murdered woman that tend to dishevel the almost perfect fairytale quality of the story, but given that all's well that end's well, it can be forgiven. "Anansi Boys" doesn't have anywhere near the broad canvas feel of "American Gods" and the extraordinary "Neverwhere", but fits nicely along side his "Stardust".  It's a fun read, full of humor and great characters, but his fans may miss that mythical cosmic sense provided by  some of his other fiction.  --Nickolas Cook 
 I give the order processing an A+ due to receiving the product within three days.  The bag, on the other had, leaves a bit to be desired.  While the material used is soft, the inexpensive zippers are difficult to operate with one hand 
 Somewhat useful book in that it pulls together the info that is readily available on the internet, particularly from state government websites 
 Being a fledgling opponent of strong AI, I picked up this book hoping to learn the weaknesses of the strong AI argument. Alas, this was the wrong book to pick up.  I am not even sure what Penrose's main argument is; of course it may be there but was lost in the 450 pages of mostly irrelevant details on physics. To say in the least, his attack is not coherent or well structured. He seems to admit that his position is very vulnerable himself: he constantly admits to mere speculation and weakness of evidence on his part.   If he abridged this book to may 100 or 200 pages, it may have been more effective. When I was half way through, I nearly quit reading because I could tell he was going nowhere, but I figured if I had already wasted this much time, I might was well finish it. I regret that decision now.   TENM may be just another example of a grandiose physicist touting an interesting subject like modern physics as accessible to the layman. If it is accessible, Penrose is not the one to do it. There seems to be a market for these pop physics books (i.e. Elegant Universe) because yuppies out there want a feeling of wonderment about things they don't understand. How much they actually get from these  books questionable.   In the end, Penrose somehow wants to say that modern physics presents an obstacle for strong AI. I hope there are books out there that actually might show this 
 For anyone listening to the audio book version, you'll wonder where Doc, Tomlinson and the gang have gone. All the work that Dick Hill did in creating the marvelous residents of Dinkin's Bay that we've come to know and love has disappeared in this novel. This RWW book definitely not up to par with the others. Did not come close to making "my favorite" list.  
 Many of the chapters just talk about protocols as if Rehab is just as simple as a cook-book  The modern style of approaching each step in the Rehab process in an evidence based manner is lacking Discussion extremely monotonous & lacking a proper discussion of pros & cons of different therapies 
 This is a dreadful book.  Didn't the writer do ANY research on Bosnia? When I got to the part where she said that describing the Bogomil philosophy was critical to understanding the mass rapes in 1992 and 1993, I  nearly tossed the book in the trash.  The Bogomils were a medieval  religious sect that died out in the 1500s.  Recent scholarship has  questioned not only their influence, but also whether the Bosnian nobles  were even Bogomils in the first place.  The writer relies on a single  interview with a seemingly distraught woman, she quotes extensively from  the interview and decides that understanding this obscure theology is a  useful tool for her readers.  Maybe if she'd done the research instead of  quoting someone she felt sorry for, the book would be better 
 In the DVD extras there are several featurettes about the making of this film. One of the most telling is the one where they talk about the writing of the script with surprising candor. There were over 100 group meetings about the story, all with the Japanese filmmakers and producers arguing for one type of movie and the American filmmakers and producers arguing for another. The result is the watered down The Grudge 2, which neither captures the imagery and suspense that makes Japanese horror genuinely startling and spooky or the plotlines and characters that make American horror easy to relate to and entertaining.   The Grudge 2 is a hodge podge of gimmicks taken from the first remake (The Grudge) as well as the original Japanese versions (Juon, Juon: The Grudge, etc.). Although you can still vaguely make out Takashi Shimizu's directorial hand in this film, it doesn't work this time. The reasons are numerous, but mostly it's just a failed hybrid of American and Japanese horror at work, as well as the basic story of a haunted house that curses those who enter beginning to show signs of weakness. There's only so far that story can be extended, and it's reaching its breaking point. (Which doesn't give that much hope for Juon: The Grudge 3, even though it will be made entirely in Japan).  The storyline in this film bounces through time and geography far too much to stay coherent, and two of the leads (Amber Tamblyn and Arielle Kebbel) look too much alike for the stories to flash back and forth so much. It's all designed like a Japanese horror film where the plot is secondary to the images, but there is a profound lack of spooky images in this film to make up for the gaping plot holes. Why do the ghosts possess people in Chicago instead of just killing them like they do in Japan?   It's all very confusing, and Sarah Michelle Gellar is lucky to get out quickly. Her entire role in this film barely qualifies her for a cameo.  Also included on this DVD are three short films made by Toby Wilkins that tie into the whole Grudge story. And by short I mean around two or three minutes each. They each have their own spooky images, but end up feeling a little too much like "Are You Afraid of the Dark?" schlock more than credible short horror films.  If you happen to watch this movie, before you take it out of your DVD player in disgust (or plain boredom) be sure to check out the special features with the making of featurettes, because they do manage to shed some light on the issues that went into making this film. And remember: sometimes sequels advance storylines and take the action even farther... and sometimes they're designed just so a big studio can line its pockets with your money. This film falls into the latter of the two categories 
 The Legend of the Candy Cane is terrible on many levels.    1. There is no historical basis for this story.  Candy canes were never meant as a symbol of Christianity.  Although a sort of disclaimer follows the end of the story, many children will not read this (or have it read to them), and will accept this story as historical fact.    2. As another reviewer mentioned, the story features a child who spends time alone with a complete stranger - that is simply irresponsible!  What a terrible message to send to impressionable children!    3. The notion that the red color is a representation of Christ's blood is ridiculous.  Is this a Christmas or an Easter story?  The illustration that accompanies this text is incredibly disturbing and graphic.  Christ is shown on the floor wearing a crown of thorns.  A man stands over him holding a whip.  I know for a fact that many children find this specific picture/illustration disturbing.    4.  Many children between the ages 4-8 (the recommended readers) are not able to understand the concept of a metaphor.  Thus, what is appropriate about a child believing that when they eat a candy cane they are licking Christ's blood?    Also, for many reasons that I would hope would be obvious, but unfortunately (apparently) are not,  ***THIS BOOK SHOULD NOT BE READ IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS***  The separation of church and state is not a debatable issue - it is a constitutional right and fundamental to freedom.  Although a public school teacher and I may both identify ourselves as Christians, we may feel VERY differently about the meanings of Christ's teachings.  Reading this book to a public school class is a complete violation of parental rights to protect children from viewpoint that they may deem erroneous and potentially damaging to their children.  My daughter received this book as a gift last Christmas.  I considered donating it to the Goodwill, but decided it was better off in the garbage.  
 If, like most people, you're a weekend gardner and don't have a lot of time, then this book is not for you. And if you do have a lot of time to spend on your garden, then you don't need this book.  
 Most of this book is a listing of some whale watching companies with litte infomation of real value.  Which ones are good?  No information about that.  But there is information if their boat serves food, which they almost all do.  Plus this information is old.  No good pictures and no quality information about whales.  I was completely disappointed in this suppossed "5 star" book.  Don't buy this book -- do searching on line instead 
 A friend of mine, who is an avid reader of many types of literature like me, highly recommended this book.  I made it about fifty pages before the confusion, depression, and disinterest forced me to cast it aside.  The book just made me disoriented and tired. 
 The individual metal pieces that make up the base do not line up when you screw them together.  The manufacturer failed to make units that screw in straight.  Instead of a solid uniform stand that comes in pre-assembled lamps, the lamp looks horribly cheap because it zig-zags at various angles instead of standing up @ a 90 degree angle because of poor manufacturing.The weight of the housing for the 5 gooseneck lamps is too much for the poorly manufactured stand and will cause your lamp to eventually lean over no matter how many times you re-position it.  I had to buy and return the lamp 3 times to get a lamp that didnt 1) have faulty wiring OR 2) the stand was not crooked OR 3) the stand did not lean over @ a 50 degree angle. Eye-pleasing lamp but the designer/manufacturer has forgotten the principle of function before form. 
 Wal-Mart has become a controversial company because it has grown immensely powerful - by revenue the biggest company in the world and the largest private employer.  From its origins as a southern mid-western company going for neglected rural markets, its story is one of remarkable success.    This book offers a succinct history and some explanation of how Wal-Mart succeeded:  it went to markets that its big competitors ignored, made everyday low prices an essential part of its brand image, cultivated a conscientious service mentality in workers, and pursued efficiency through both scale and operations.  That is its business model in a nutshell.  Slater presents this matter of factly, as a natural evolution that carried the seeds of genius in the personality of earthy founder Sam Walton.  The bulk of the story is how Walton's successors expanded the company far beyond what the founder achieved, making it truly global and putting a bureaucratic system into place.  This was a bit useful for me as I start to investigate the company for a writing project.  Unfortunately, this book felt to me like Slater was happy to propogate the myth that Wal-Mart wishes observers to believe about the company.  He recounts how employees are taught to cheerlead, and acts like they want to, like they feel it sincerely rather than do it because they have to!  I can say that I found it hard to believe:  big companies are rarely happy and enthusiastic places.  Is that conclusion surprising to anyone?  It would be for Slater, who himself is a cheerleader.  Even worse, he only perfunctorily asks himself any of the hard questions - such as the company's treatment of labor, its transforming impact on local communities, its use of sweatshops, etc. etc. - and then quickly implies that they are largely superfluous or silly exaggerations.  This is nothing short of a simple white wash, and reads like PR that is trying to pose as thoughtful.  This is really mediocre and shallow, almost like a company brochure.  Slater failed to get inside the company, though he did do some interviews with prepped top officials, or so it appeared to me.  Oddly, as a relatively conservative business writer, I would give Wal-Mart the benefit of the doubt, pending my own investigation as a reporter.  But Slater seems to be openly endorsing the company as if it lived up to its own PR.  It is appalling to me, and I am no leftie or automatic critic of big companies, but I am a skeptic as a reporter.    Indeed, where he did address issues, they were never detailed enough, but instead were the most simplistic and narrow-minded generalizations.  For example, he writes:  "A new attitude was beginning to surface...Rather than show disdain for the negativism, the feeling was growing that there was virtue in having the media and community activists monitoring Wal-Mart."   That pap is emblematic of the tone of this book and perfectly reflects how superficial it is.  It also flatly contradicts what I have heard through the corporate grapevine with only the most simple of inquiries among my contacts.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book.  Reading it is like getting a huge vanilla milkshake for dinner rather than a steak.  I will have to look elsewhere for more balanced treatments of the many thorny issues that this huge company has helped to create 
 The book starts out with how wonderful this Dharma Mittra is (by the editors).  Then Dharma Mittra tells you how wonderful he is and barely scratches the surface of a Yoga practice that is compatible with a busy life.  The rest of the book is pictures of Dharma Mittra in yoga poses.  His gentialia are so prominent in most of the poses it is obscene.  I am not a prude after 25 years of nursing but please!  When I tried to use the book as examples of what poses should look like all I got was laughter.  Even from my supervisor!   There are no explanations of how to get into or out of the poses safely.  No suggestions to adapt the poses and no pointing out the nuances of a pose, breathing suggestions, or even a notation of what conditions the poses may help with.   This book doesn't deserve a star at all but rather a parental warning label 
 I've read most of the books written by Greg Iles. I liked them all except Dead Sleep, which by the way was much better than this one!  Anyway, despite Dead Sleep, if I see a book by this author I haven't read yet I'd grab them right away without further thinking because I enjoyed the rest of his work very much.   So, when I bought Sleep No More I was prepared to stay up all night because I was certain it would be thrilling. WRONG!  The whole Mallory/Eve/Cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though I set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests.  I still laugh when I think of the explanation of how Mallory gets into another person (she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm). I should give Greg Iles some credit for this idea, a stupid one, but creative nonetheless.  As for the characters, I was so appalled by the paranormal plot that I couldn't care less about any of them. I read The Quiet Game and liked it, but the appearance of Penn Cage was just so blah because he's like a cameo in this book and didn't have a character development nor adds anything to this book.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this, especially to those who liked other books by Greg Iles.  Nevertheless, I'm going to continue to purchase other books by him because I enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers. 
 I received this set for Christmas, and like another reviewer here, I was disappointed with the notes that delved into wild speculation and fantastic opinion rather than shedding light on Holmes's world and times.   Not only that, but at least one note made an outrageous error of fact: in "The Beryl Coronet," Holder says up front that he is offering a reward of 1000 pounds for the return of the coronet, but Klinger (and his Holmesian cronies) were apparently stumped as to why, later, Holmes asked Holder for a check for 4000 pounds (3 beryls at 1000 pounds apiece, plus 1000-pound reward), and hypothesize (apparently for their own amusement) in the note that he took the 1000 pounds as a bribe to keep quiet about some wholly speculative scheme of blackmail Holder had going on the side. I had placed the set in my wish list with an eye towards getting the background on Victorian London that would clearly explain so many of the more esoteric features of Holmes stories, not reading fans' attempts to rewrite the stories to suit their own theories.  In addition, the silliness of perpetuating what Klinger calls "the gentle fiction" that Holmes was a living person and that Doyle was just a literary agent for Watson did not sit well with me. I expected a scholarly introduction, not self-delusion masked as scholarship.  Very disappointed 
 In the right hands this novel could be translated into an exciting movie.  The premise is interesting, but falls completely flat with the sewn up ending.  A true happily ever after, that begs for a more smartly written sequel in which everything unravels would be delicious.  The hardest aspect to swallow was that this super extra terrestrial life form could divide out of control then just be neatly killed and carried to a lab in the desert for benevolent study.  Sheesh!  I really thought it was going to get scary at some point! The major antagonist of the story is a tattoed up ex inmate who fancies himself a master mind killer-when in reality he is just a sharpshooting (except when it really counts) boob!  And boy does he meet his match in a simple pair of desert folk, who happen to be expert gunslingers and survivalists to boot!  This is all very funny, but to me the funniest part of the entire book is the description of the male tyrannasaur mounting the female and trumpeting loudly in the wild prehistoric world he inhabits!!!! 
 I browsed this book in 10 seconds on a shelf. Not a very good basis for a review huh? Why did I put it back so quick and feel compelled to write here? I flicked to a page supposedly "exposing myths".  "Myth #1" was about exercise and high carb diets. He brushes aside the importance of "excess calories" claiming the effect of "carbs turning to fat" is more important! It is at that point I realised the author is probably very rich, smiled and put the book back on the shelf. The authors whole premise, is partly based on something that hardly happens. And this has been known since about 1982!! The author ends up trying to debunk a possibly sound dieting approach by himself regurgitating a complete myth. He says "The body has limited capacity to store carbohydrates so it converts them into fat". He's wrong. Several studies have shown  this happens in such small amounts that it is insignificant and that the body can store lots of carbs.  I'm not saying excess carbs dont contribute to getting fatter - they do by promoting storage of dietary fat and reducing the burning of body fat - and the author is right about that, but wrong about carbs turning to fat.  An oversight, you might say? Now if the author can get such a well know thing (amongst REAL nutritionists) wrong, which is, presumably, at the core of his entire book, and has been known for over 20 years, what does that say about his whole approach. Some things he says are right?, others wrong ?, and all he's looking for is a new angle/fad to part you from your money.  It's simple , eat less , eat more real food , cut out processed foods ,cut out emotional eating, get more excercise, rinse and repeat.  The "Diet Book" thing is an industry. Plain and simple. Spend the money on some real food.  (*) The evidence....  "1982 Acheson KJ, Flatt JP, Jequier E."   Conclusion These ***findings challenge the common perception*** that conversion of CHO[carbs] to fat is an important pathway for the retention of dietary energy and for the accumulation of body fat.  and   "2001 Regina M McDevitt, Sarah J Bott, Marilyn Harding, W Andrew Coward, Leslie J Bluck and Andrew M Prentice"   Conclusion: De novo lipogenesis[carbs turning to fat] increases after overfeeding with glucose and sucrose to the same extent in lean and obese women ***but does not contribute greatly to total fat balance.***  Google for "de novo lipogenesis" for more [Note you may find a link to the last study at Atkins website where they completely ignore the conclusion because it disputes some of their principles too. This is an indictment of the diet-industry in general] 
 I bought the RIGHT edition and then sent me the WRONG ONE! 
 Most people can't get enough of this movie. I even own it on laserdisc. When I saw that there was a 20th anniversary edition availible on DVD, I had to have it. I am sorely disappointed in the video transfer quality. It lookslike there was just a transfer from VHS to DVD. There doesn't seem to be any attempt to remaster the video and clear it up or improve the audio quality. I recently saw it on HDNet Movies and thought it looked much better.  DO buy this movie because it is an all time classic. Don't buy this movie if you think that the 20th Anniversary edition is going to get you anything better 
 Narcissistic hypocrytical douche bag. Comments on Bill Clinton's sexual escapades, but settles a sexual harassment suit out of court for 2 million dollars. Douche Bag 
  There is something about "Fountainhead" that irritated and disappointed  me, so I would stop reading and come back to it again. At some point, I just gave up thinking about the philosophical aspect of the novel  and tried to enjoy it as a piece of literature. What can I say? I  understand with my mind the ideas about the purpose of human  beings to be free and follow their own unique way in pursuit of happiness  and full realization of their talents and abilities. I also find very attractive the idea of always being true to yourself and  to your trade no matter what and to never compromise your principles and never betray yourself. Yes, I  understand that completely but the main character, Howard Roark, who supposed to be a hero  and an ideal Man left me indifferent. Well, he is not a human being, really,  more like Titan (Prometheus would come to mind), but he is cold as ice. He  does not care about anybody or at least he is doing a very good job in  hiding the human emotions. The love story in the novel is repulsive and sickening. The female character, Dominique, looks like a cold frigid doll that is not able to feel love unless it goes together  with hate and domination. Why do they have to be so unhappy and make me, the reader so miserable?    The only character who I think is  very interesting, Gail Waynad - the  man who was able to learn everything he knew by himself with no help from  outside whatsoever, the man who named his beloved yacht "I Do" because he  does rule places and has a right to say so.   2.5/5  
 First of all I cannot stand Jennifer Aniston in any way,shape or form! But wanting to watch something in this day of retread movie plots I gave it a go.  I have to say Anniston was a better actress than I thought, because from the moment she meets Clive Owen it looks like she couldn't care less about him and therefore I guessed where the plot was going immediately and what her agenda really was.   Why would such a cash strapped guy with a sick kid even THINK about doing what he did? I found that hard to believe.   At least Aniston won't be around much longer.She's on the downhill slide to 40 and not movie star pretty at all. In fact in the hotel where the big assault happens, did anyone notice as she is sitting on the bed how much like DUSTIN HOFFMAN she is beginning to look like?  Thank Brad for your fame, girl, otherwise you're just a faded TV hack. 
        This book was tiresome reading at times, with many mathematical tables of which were put in the book to provide an alibi for whomever might disagree with the man and how he came to the conclusions he had done. I must agree with one of the reviwers of this book --- " Who cares?". I mean ultimately, it will be the readers themselves that will judge what exactly was the greatest and productive findings in history.   The Techonologically inclined will say that Science is the master of all that is and the more liberal arts type will insist that the Arts is what defines a culture. The fact is that both do because both hold a sea-saw effect, without imagination there is no science and without science there is no reason for a human being to think beyond what reality tells him to be so. It is science that produces better paints, better materials that lets the Artist craft and produce --- so why pit them against eachother?    It is that point that I will give this particular book 2 stars, as well as the way it was made. The side notes in a terrible headache making Blue with white type was a horrible idea. The reading was very drawn out and I've read better on far more drier  material.  The fact the guy took a good few years of his life to do this seems kind of odd, and I question it --- one should wonder, why? Somone could have made the arguement that the West had a far more promenint mark on the world in far fewer pages and time then this particular author has done. 
 I bought this book, as a dancer, to read about a dancer's life. What I found was a horribly atrocious story not about the true struggles of a dancer but the struggles of a girl in a sexual relationship, who happened to be a dancer. If you want a story about what it truly is like to be a dancer read Winter Season by Toni Bentley. Whatever you do, DO NOT buy this book. It's a waste of space. After I read this story I found myself incredibly depressed and I had to psyche myself up to feel better.If you want to read a sexual story go for it but somehow it wasn't very tasteful. 
 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's basically a movie about 3 kids who grew up together only one was emotionally scarred for life as a child. As they grow up they all go their seperate ways until another horrific event brings them all together again for one more sad, unsettling experience together. Does anyone grow or learn anything? No. Do the "bad guys" pay? No. It is difficult for me to say just how much this movie sucks without giving away the ending. Suffice to say that no one wins, innocent people get screwed over, and in the end - no one really learns anything. It's a thoroughly depressing movie with no point - unless the point is that life sucks. As if viewers don't have enough of their own problems, or as if real life isn't traumatizing enough - we are subjected to this horrible 2 1/2 hours of misery. I am not exaggerating - there is no redeeming value to this movie. Sure the acting is great, but what good is it with such a tragic story. And this is not like a Greek Tragedy or Shakespeare Tragedy - there are no heroes, no lessons to be learned, no moral to the story - it just makes you feel miserable and hollow and then nothing - just the credits rolling. This movie is so terrible that I would rather watch "Kazaam" than watch this again 
 Because of the infinite complexity of human behavior, attempts to explain it are almost wholly speculative - especially when the subject is as complex as war.  With no nod to that reality, Mr. Hanson unimaginatively adopts the popular myths of the ideological right to explain what he believes has been an unbroken history of Western military dominance.  Some of the reasons that he offers are capitalism, freedom, and individualism.  He should be writing political speeches, not history.  His theories are just plain silly.    If you can skim through the countless repetitive passages, much of his descriptive material is, however, interesting 
 I ordered 2 wristlets - a brown and a leopard print. I was sent TWO brown wristlets, the return process was difficult, and when I returned the product I DID NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OR THE CORRECT PRODUCT!! 
 When I saw this movie as a young boy, I loved it.  I saw it later in life, having served 4 years in the USMC, and I found it way off the mark.  I was very disappointed 
 I gave him more than 1 star because I think that a lot of good time and research went into this book.  It was a subject that interested me originally, but by about page 80 I was sick of it.  Mostly it is an account of Northern women before the Civil War, and how the woman's rights movement corresponded with the anti-slavery movement (for how can a woman urge emancipation for herself without feeling bad for others as well).  Sounds interesting enough.  That's why I bought it.  I was wrong.  There were a lot of quotes from Uncle Tom's Cabin and I started to think that if I wanted Harriet Beecher Stowe's comments about anti-slavery politics than I would read her books (the author goes on to quote another one of her books, Dred). There would be no reason to read or purchase this book unless it was to aid your research about the role of gender in the 1850s.  Otherwise I recommend to stay away and read something with more personality so as to not bore you 
 First off, the graphic novel is and will be better than a movie, novelization, play, interpretative dance, or whatever other form you want to put it in. Why? Because graphic novels/comics are a medium which cannot duplicated. As a reader you are much more actively involved in the story than passively watching a movie. With the page in your hand you may stare at it as long as you like, flip it upside down, flip back to a page previous, or any other number of things us crazy folks do who read these wonderful masterpieces of our time.   To correct the person who, incorrectly, pointed to the artist of this work (Mr. David Lloyd) as disapproving of the film, it was not the artist who protested it's creation, it was the author, Mr. Alan Moore. Just as he has with the other hideously molested adaptations of his work (From Hell, Leauge of Extraordinary Gentleman) he did not want to have anything to with this million dollar money trap. He has several reasons which you may find out by simply searching for any number of interviews with him, but basically he does not approve of this and all other big budget, no substance movies that are produced solely for the purpose of extorting money from   parents through their children, while offering no real meaning or substance other than an orgy of explosions and bastardizations of once meaningful tales. He gives his portion of the proceeds to the artists involved.  Also in the correction department, this series began in 1982 and was published until 1985 in the UK's Warrior magazine, alongside other great works such as Marvelman (originally being in black and white). Upon the success of Moore in the mid to late eighties, with such work as Watchmen and his revitalization of the Swamp Thing series, DC decided to 'resurrect' V and thus Moore and Lloyd continued the series to its conclusion.   If you want to experience V for Vendetta the way it was meant to be, go to your local comic shop and pick up a copy of the trade, you won't be disappointed (unless you're a mindless idiot who eats up whatever bs movie comes down the pike for whatever mindless reason, in that case there's no hope anyway, how'd you even get to this webpage??).    "Hello the Voice of Fate and V for Vendetta. 
 The animal rights issue is a tricky one, because it touches on really deep questions about what it means to be conscious, to have rights, and to experience suffering.  So you might expect a philosopher to be able to sort through the ethical issues and suggest a way forward.  If so, you would be disappointed by this book.  The first chapter lays out the philosophical foundation of the book.  Singer argues that there's really no basis for assigning equal rights to all humans, since different humans have different abilities.  Therefore equality must be based on the recognition of another person's interests.  Since animals have interests too, they deserve equal treatment.  That's it.  It's not terribly deep, and frankly not even rational, but Singer doesn't bother to elaborate.  So if animals have interests, then they obviously have an interest in not suffering.  How do we know animals are capable of suffering?  According to Singer there are two signs:  they seek to avoid painful stimuli and they have nervous systems that bear a superficial similarity to those of humans.  He doesn't say how he came up with these criteria, but they seem awfully generous to me.    In fact, based on those criteria one would conclude that monkeys are capable of understanding spoken language and that humans are capable of echolocation.  Monkeys do in fact respond to certain vocalizations, and they have all the relevant physiological structures for understanding speech.  And humans actually can echolocate (with a lot of practice).  The point is that you would never seriously compare human echolocation to bat echolocation, and the ability of monkeys to process speech is negligible relative to that of humans.  Could this also be true of the capacity for pain and suffering?  I don't think anyone knows, and Singer doesn't shed any light on the subject.  The next chapter is about animal testing, and a lot of the chapter deals with the use of animals in scientific experiments.  This is the weakest part of the book.  Singer finds some of the most gruesome experiments in science history, and juxtaposes them with out-of-context quotes from the researchers to make it look like the research was useless.  He mentions in passing that the vast majority of animal experiments don't involve pain, but by the end of the chapter he suggests that all medical experimentation should eventually be stopped.  Part of his justification for ending medical experiments is the notion that such experiments don't actually contribute to medical or scientific progress.  This idea is unfortunately quite common among people who don't know anything about medicine or science.  However it's completely incorrect, and most of Singer's arguments regarding the scientific value of animal testing have been completely debunked.  For example, he continues to exploit the thalidomide tragedy, even though it was already known at the time the book was written that that incident was unrelated to animal testing.  In addition to being totally confused about science, Singer seems uncomfortable with the scientific method itself.  He repeatedly suggests that animal testing should, in the short term, be limited to experiments that will lead to rapid advances in medical treatment.  This is like saying you should look for your lost car keys where you left them.  Science doesn't work this way.  At one point (p. 47), Singer complains about a series of experiments that were shown "first to prove a theory, then to disprove the theory, and finally to support modified versions of the original theory."  This probably sounds ridiculous to a philosopher, but it's actually a pretty good description of the scientific method.  The next chapter deals with factory farming, and here Singer is on firmer ground.  As in the previous chapter, there's no philosophy, or even rational discourse.  It's just page after page of description, in this case of the conditions of animals on a large farm.  However, in contrast to the chapter on experimentation, the conditions he describes are standard practice for the majority of farm animals.  Here it would seem that there's plenty of room for improvement with comparatively minimal consequences for humans (although I imagine the situation has only gotten worse since the publication of the second edition of the book in 1990).  The next chapter deals with vegetarianism, calling for a boycott of meat and dairy products.  Again the appeal is basically emotional, and if you were moved by the arguments of the preceding chapter, you will presumably find this chapter convincing.  Curiously Singer doesn't call for a similar boycott of medicine or medical treatment, even though the argument would be identical.  Even if you belief that animal experimentation is useless for human medicine, you have to admit that the purchase of such medicine directly pays for more animal research.  Anyone who's receiving treatment for cardiac problems or diabetes, or who has ever had surgery, or who takes prescription drugs, is contributing to animal suffering.  Maybe Singer deals with this in another book, but given the chapter on vegetarianism it's a rather obvious omission.  The next chapter is a strangely out of place history of human attitudes toward animals, going back several thousand years.  It might have made sense to put this at the beginning of the book, but perhaps his editor was afraid of losing readers.  The last chapter talks about some popular animal rights movements and their accomplishments.  Singer doesn't draw any line between violent organizations like the Animal Liberation Front (which the FBI considers a terrorist organization) and organizations that actually help animals in a peaceful way (like the ASPCA).  He speaks positively of PETA, which in addition to other extremist activities, supports violence and arson.  I don't know why he would do this.  Ultimately this is a bad book.  It trivializes a serious issue by  substituting emotional imagery for rational argumentation.  The fact is that humans can benefit greatly from actions that adversely affect animals.  In the realm of science, there is no serious doubt that the length and quality of human life have been improved through animal testing.  With other behaviors, such as meat-eating, the benefits are more subjective and the suffering is probably greater.  How we assign weight to these costs and benefits is a very difficult question that Singer doesn't even attempt to take seriously 
 This is an overwritten and overhyped piece of fiction that will never pass for great literature. It is timely but it is not timeless.    Not one character comes alive even though they all talk endlessly. Not one scene is memorable. The true nature of the book -- soap opera-- is cloaked under its many pages.   Messud is a good writer who in this instance could not tell a good story, and she seems to have believed her publicity machine.  I can't believe that her husband, who a great literary critic, would not talk her out of publishing this.  Oh.  I forgot.  Money and fame trumps quality every time. 
 Gene Cernan is one of America's most experienced and successful astronauts. His three missions were among the most ambitious, successful and exciting of all time. He spent more time, along with partner Harrison Schmitt, than any other man walking on the moon. It was, therefore, with great disappointment that I read this book. What I expect from a book by an astronaut is to really feel and understand what the unique experiences they went through were like and what challenges-physical, mental and technical they overcame. With the notable exception of Mike Collins' autobiography almost none of the astronauts books really provide this. Only 12 men have ever stood on the moon and yet they have not really conveyed what this and other aspects of spaceflight were like in their autobiographies. He dismisses his epic Apollo 17 flight in a few pages and spends more time talking about the politics of crew selection, giving crude descriptions of his wife's figure and other trivia. Also there is a lack of illustrations showing the alien environment he explored so well. Most of the astronauts who wrote autobiographies felt they had to talk down to their audience to make the book attractive to the average reader, thus leaving out much technical information that is actually quite interesting, even for the non-technically-minded layman.  The popularity of the film "Apollo 13" and the television series "From the Earth to the Moon" in which technical matters were not shied away from proves this is not true.  The fact is the true intelligence and abilities of these men is measured in what they did on their space missions, not as golfers or in planning practical jokes or in celebrity namedropping.  In a more positive light, he reveals for the first time the real dangers the Gemini spacewalks entailed and gives a good description of the problems Ed White encountered in Gemini 4 and his own nightmarish experience in Gemini 9.  
 Denise Austin needs to stick with making exercise videos for adults. This video isn't kid friendly, and doesn't have a good feel for kids. To be honest, it is very close to most of Denise's exercise videos for adults. What Denise has forgotten, or may have never known, is kids are kids, and they need to be treated accordingly, and that means with exercise videos to. A good choice for kids is - Kick to Get Fit Jr. -For Kids, this video is done by a qualified kid's fitness professional, not someone who is just throwing adult type movements at kids, and just hoping they can do them. My kids are NOT at all happy with this program.  There are 6 & 10 years old, and they were bored & turned off by this video within the first 5 minutes, mostly because they didn't understand the movements, and then found most of the other movements very hard to do. Once again, the forgotten point - Kids are kids, and they need to be treated accordingly. One last point, in the video Denise mentions that she received information from a variety of different professionals in the field of children's exercise & fitness. This is all good except they all forgot one VERY IMPORTANT DETAIL,-  You MUST be able to teach & instruct children at a level they understand. Just because you know something about exercise, it doesn't mean you are able to teach it to children. Knowledge is one thing - Teaching & Instructing is another, and the fact is, some people are just not very good at instructing children. A point that is very clearly displayed within this program. 
 This was a very hard book to read unless you had a lot of caffeine. The author uses so many descriptive phrases it is hard to follow. This is not a book you would willingly read it has to be forced upon you 
 I ordered a KidCo Elongated child gate. A recommended extension needed to be purchased. The wrong extension was sent. I needed G24 model and received 24" extension for a different model 
 We bought this for our three-year-old daughter. I do not even know where to begin to convey my disappointment. This is no better than a plastic toy that lights up as you push buttons.   First, The price of the unit plus the software is ridiculous for what you actually get.  Second, the software is a JOKE. It is not intuitive. It is not challenging. It is hardly interactive. There is nothing to be learned except the word "dummy".  The voices are disturbing and the diaglogue is snippy at some times. Most of the time you just sit there and watch what little content is available on each program, instead of interacting and learning.  It is actually worse than plopping your toddler in front of the TV.   The overall concept and idea is good and we were very excited about it. We were expecting to learn colors, numbers, letters, and a lot more interactivity such as games,puzzles and problem solving.  There is freeware/shareware available on the internet that is far better than this. I'm wondering who was consulted when Comfy designed this stuff. I was an early childhood educator for 10 years and I would never have used this in my class.  The software titles we purchased are Christmas in Comfyland, Joy of Music, Animal World, Your Neighborhood, and World of Colors. All a complete and total waste of money. I am so sick about it. I know I sound harsh, but I don't want anyone to waste their money like we did. 
 Julia Child was a lovely person with an interesting life but this book as written is unreadable. Poor sentence structure and continual,unecessary use of parenthesis. Try My Life in France. Much better 
 I rented this movie mostly because they goof on it in "The 40 Year Old Virgin." I like Caruso on CSI Miami, but I have begun to see that Caruso always plays David Caruso. Yet, here he plays an even less cheerful cop. What fun. His character in Jade is so stoic that he makes Dirty Harry look like a neurotic. Sadly, this is one of those erotic thrillers that is neither thrilling nor erotic. It's better than your usual Shannon Tweed erotic thriller twaddle, mostly because you get Chaz Palminteri as a supporting character rather than, say, William Katt. The plot makes no sense, however, and the sex scenes are boring. If you want good-looking sex, rent some porn. If you want a good thriller, rent Rear Window. 
 I tried 4 DVDs with different DVD writers and still doesn't work.  This stuff is junk.  In addition, the manufacturer never sent the rebate.  Don't buy anything from Velocity 
 Milkovich and Newman? Do the other reviewer's have the right book As I right this review I have the book next to me and I can't find any reference to a Milkovich and Newman?  Whoever these fine people are I can't see how they have anything to do with this textbook.  As for the textbook, I had to use it for my introductory Management class as part of my MBA program. And halfway through my MBA program this book gets the award for the dryest, boring, waste of trees. Yeach I've complained about Marketing, but this book is far worse.    Instead of explaining the intricacies of management and addressing contemporary issues in the typical office, this book focuses on stating the obvious, restating it again, without offering any arguments, any conclusions, or even giving any advice.  Consider this typical sentence, which I found by randomly opening the book. 'As previously indicated, conflict may have either positive or negative consequences for the organization, depnding upon how much exists and how it is managed.' (pg. 358).  When they aren't boring the reader with their lack of depth and insight the authors  bore the reader with stupid asides on companies that add nothing. Consider the following sentence, 'The 13,000 restaurants in McDonald's network all pay attention to quality, service, and cleanliness.' (pg. 41). You mean the authors find it necessary to teach MBA students how to serve fast food? I thought that was the reason kids enroll in these programs so they don't won't end up working in a fast food joint.  This book was so bad, that some of my classmates gave up even trying to read the chapters, because they weren't getting anything out of it. And although the material is very elementary it's written with so much filler material that it is extremely hard reading. It as if the authors were paid based on how many words they were able to write, so that the book would look thinker and the publisher could justify it's outrageous list price.  And the worst part is that the material is so disorganized that some of the information in the chapter summaries isn't even covered in the chapters. I'm just glad I only had to put up with semester of this trash 
 I was a little disappointed to see the clothes from the dress up trunk.  When my daughter took them out on Christmas day and started trying them on, we all broke out in laughter.  The shirts that they included in the trunk came up to her upper chest area.  I'm not sure who they made these shirts to fit, but they don't fit my very skinny 4 yr old or my 3 yr old son who is shorter in stature then my 4 yr old.  Some of the clothes are cute but I would save your money and buy something else 
 I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long.  There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep.  avoid at all cost 
 This book is tacky, demeaning and downright offensive!  I have just as much a sense of humor as any of my fellow Southerners but this goes beyond mere comedy.  Most of the content is so negative it is unbelievable. I truly question Mr. Barnette's origins and/or loyalty.  I hesitate to try any of his other work 
 So not at all what i was expecting. I had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it,i was terribly disappointed and confused.  
 The stories collected in this book offer the promise of exciting stories dealing with the Knights Templar, a topic that begs to be handled intelligently in fiction format. What the reader gets instead are weak 20-30 page stories that offer absolutely nothing for the reader that may intrigue, educate or even entertain. The authors who contributed seem to be accomplished writers in their own right, but that is not evident with these stories. Some are poorly written (such as "The City of Brass") and others deal with the topic of the Templars in ridiculous ways. One thing that really bothered me was the addition of Kurtz's short story that takes place within the story of her own series of books! Basically, I would have to read her books to make even the slightest sense of the short story. Very poorly thought out. The best thing about this collection (and the only reason I gave it two stars) were the Interludes between stories, which offered up some basic info on the Knights. Definately not worth buying this book for, though 
 I do not recomend this product. I bought it and I tried cleaning off the scratches on my ipod for 1 hour. I repeated the applications, used a lot of pressure, I used both the deep scratch remover and the regular polish. By they end only a few minor scratches were gone, the deep ones no matter how hard I tried were still present, and the cloth that came with the icleaner left new scratches on my ipod. I have a new 30g 5th generation video ipod, and I heard that the screen is very sensitive, so that could be the reason for the icleaner not working 
 These guys are the worst. I wish they would crawl in a hole & never come out. One of the worst bands of our era 
 Simply a bad book. It reads as a tired output of an old man fulfilling a task. His ideas about Roman empire fall sounds, in fact,  like those you could read in XIX century divulgation book for children. He talks of a biomedical crisis, but he does not offer data neither deep reasonning to support such simplistic idea. It seems like Mr Cantor believes the Roman Empire fell because too much people begun too used to die.  Pitiful book for such a renowned historian 
 I really, really did not enjoy reading this book.  I sort of liked the first chapter, but it was all downhill from there.  The author makes all these comparisons between the subjects of her chapters, but they're all  obvious, and it makes it seem like she's just trying to take up space and  talk down to readers--like she's assuming we couldn't draw these very  obvious conclusions ourselves.  I didn't even think that most of the people  she featured in the chapters were that remarkable.  Definitely not a book  to waste your money on 
 I'm listening to Everyone Loves a Loser as I write this, and I'm actually bored.  It sounds like a pop song, FCOL.  I got hooked on Big Calm after only ONE song that was included on a mix CD I got for free after attending a Stevie Nicks concert.    This album just isn't as interesting as Big Calm was.  I'm going to see what Skye has been up to... hopefully she has a solo album out.  FCOL = "for crying out loud" 
 Women write excellent novels about women. This should not be startling news. Some men write well about women, but not that many. This also should not be news. Baldacci does an excellent job. He stays away from sex and clothing. LeCarre does a magnificent job. Robert B. Parker on occasion hits nothing but net with his new 'Sunny Randall' series, but not all the time. Too often, they're male characters who are a size 5. This is the case with Deaver and 'Rune.'  First of all, the one name bit. Who are we kidding? Have you in your personal lives ever known a human being with one name? I  have not. I don't know anyone who knows any one named persons. So at the very outset, it's incredible.  Then she's an assistant camera person who talks her way into the major talent on a news program, and talks herself into an assignment of major consequences. That happens every day. She worked in a video store before this! She was a salesgirl!  She lives on a houseboat in Manhattan. Now you know that Manhattan, insofar as Real Estate goes, makes Ann Arbor, Lincoln Park and Santa Barbara look like the ghetto. So . . . how? How does she afford this? She has a $50,000 dollar camera . . . how?  Her tastes are promiscuous, she's caring for a 4 year old abandoned child, feeding her cheetos and sardines, she get's a murderer out of prison on guile and deception.  It was a struggle, Mr. Deaver, to finish this book. And finally, most readers CAN'T STAND when the agent says 'Hey, you're really selling now. Got anything you wrote 20 years ago?' That's what this is. It's just a republication of a republication. Come on. We deserve more than that. We are your faithful fans. 1 star. Larry Scantlebury 
 Reason To Believe has got to be the worst movie I have ever sat through. Non of the characters are at all believable and most are morally disgusting. I am no prude but if this movie represents the way college students live today then it is no wonder the world is in such decay. There really is no reason to see this movie. Totally disgusting. Why well known actors would be involved in such sleazy trash is beyond comprehension!!! 
 I is for I love you 'cause I have to, America.  Give the kids real books, please. Leave the brainwashing for the older folks 
 The Panasonic is very compact, very stylish SEXY as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! Even if set on the lowest ASA setting at 80ASA it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100ASA.  The colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in Photoshop CS2. Of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. If one investigates such things, will notice that the Panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as Sony's, Canon improves this to 180, and Nikon is at 300 dpi. It is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. Obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi.   So before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. Try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. Set the camera for the lowest ASA and the highest picture quality in JPG format, take the photos, pop the SD card  into the computer, compare the images in Photoshop. Enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. That is what I did, since I was not very happy with the images my Panasonic produced! I had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today I traded it in on a Nikon P5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the Leica D-lux3 10MP camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too 
 This book is about a man named Ray Atlee whose father has just died, leaving $3 million in unexplained cash.  Someone else knows about the money.  The three major questions for the book to answer are:  1) Where did the money come from? 2) Who is the mystery person (or people) trying to get it? 3) What will Ray do with it?  I have reached page 261 in this book, and NONE of these questions have been answered.  Ray has moved the money around, been vaguely threatened by person or persons unknown and had many conversations with side characters that all led nowhere.  261 pages in, all I know is where the money DIDN'T come from.  This is a legal thriller that does not thrill.  The pacing is deadly dull and I keep waiting, waiting, WAITING for something to happen and nothing does.  Finally I threw the book down in frustration an hour or so ago when I realized how close to 300 pages I'd gotten with nothing happening.  I don't know why I even gave the book this much of a chance.  Nothing bad has happened to him, and even though three million is at stake, none of the bad guys have taken any but the most harmless ways of trying to get it.  If they were really following him as much as it's alluded to in the book, they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash.  He spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car, for God's sake!  I may finish it one day, but as of now I just don't care about the money or the characters who are after it.  Not Grisham's best, by a long shot 
 Meanwhile a lot of other people written very good books in a very different stile: Suzanne Clothier (Bones would rain from the Sky) Patricia McConnell (The other end of the Leash) Turid Rugaas (Calming Signals)  We have three Irish Setter and we prefer a soft method for our dogs 
 Dear author, reader, brother, sister, friend,  I apologize for being the bearer of bad news, but the traditions in the Andes just arent quite what they used to be.  The author of this book conducted her so-called research in 1996, but a lot has changed in less than ten years.  The communities of Qeros have changed a lot too, and the supposed Reality the author tries to come to terms with in this book is very different from what she describes.    Tourism and the Mystical Tourism industry in Peru have severely transformed the spiritual climate in Qeros, as well as elsewhere.  Most, but not all, so-called traditions that exist today are for the benefit of foreign tourists with money.  (I find it hard to believe that the author is unaware of that fact, though she doesnt mention it much.)  The supposedly mystical experiences and knowledge herein Must be received as one receives a report from a tourist.  In other words, take this book as the information gathered by someone who does Not speak the language, hasnt done her homework, got some of the names wrong, and interpreted what she saw through decidedly western eyes.    While claiming to present the Andean Mystical tradition as a self-contained and unromanticized whole, the author does little more than reveal her own lack of cultural immersion and over-simplifications in the face of an entirely alien religious, mystical, and spiritual system (as bound, importantly, in a deep, ancient, and wholly unique cultural framework).  What little she does to reveal spiritual insights (and frankly, many of these insights are just cases of poor interpretation, or simply incorrect, period) is perverted by a lack of cultural awareness and sensitivity, paramount in giving the spiritual issues context.    For many years I have studied firsthand with and have close friends among the Qeros, conversing in their language (Quechua), not mine.  What I have come to understand is that it is NOT vital that we understand their spiritual tradition-- in our western arrogance and self-importance, indeed it is insulting-- unless we are willing to do what it takes to KNOW the traditions.    The author seeks to explain and understand, but just doesnt know at all.  I wish her well on her continued spiritual journey, but truly wonder what she hopes to gain by furthering a romanticized and westernized image of a very distinct spiritual and cultural tradition.  I give her the benefit of the doubt, though, and lament that perhaps she truly has no idea how far from the truth she is.    (... 
 I had to read this book for school. I thought I would love it, but it turns out I was WRONG. This book was mind numbing. It is drawn out and boring. I almost threw the book away and rented the movie. I should have. This books sucks. Don't waste your time reading it 
 If you are looking for help working your way through a new loc journey, (what to use, how to do it etc.) this book is not for you. If your doing research on the history of loc'd hair, with lots of personal convictions - this book is for you. If you have made the decision to loc your hair, you probably already have your own convictions - you don't need to buy them from a stranger. . I was so disappointed that with this book, I actually tossed it in the trash - something I almost never do.  
 The film-makers will walk the plank in shark infested waters for this one. Blackbeards ghost does not wander around a random college campus making smart comments, pulling lame pranks, and acting like a low-life burn-out loser, I do. Blackbeard is obviously drunk on his ghost-ship in the caribbean. The film-makers are obviously the heirs to filthy british royalty carrying out a plot to give pirates everywhere a bad name.   
 Don't buy this book.  It wasn't John Sears.  We know now that it was W. Mark Felt, the No. 2 man at the FBI who was the source. 
 I guess I'm one of the few people who didn't already know this, but if you use wireless internet and other wireless connections (wireless keyboard, wireless mouse, wireless printer, etc.) you CANNOT use 5.8 GHz phones without having horrible interference on the phone. In fact, even 2.4 GHz phones get "some" static/signal loss around wireless internet connections.  Apparently, after calling Uniden customer support I found out that if you want to use a wireless phone around a wireless internet connection you MUST use a "less advanced" 900 MHz phone.  I returned this phone and bought a 900 MHz phone that works perfect. Sad that a more advanced, more expensive phone is WORSE than a cheaper, less advanced cordless phone.  If you don't have wireless internet (and none of your neighbors have wireless internet) then I'm sure this phone is fine 
 Though this book has lovely quilts, it is very light on technique. It is more a showcase for the artists quilts. I purchased the book hoping for concise clear instructions and possibly some patterns to get started; this book has no patterns and is really light on instruction. If you enjoy looking at beautiful quilts only, then you will enjoy this book. If you are looking for something with a lot of technical info, keep looking, this is not the book for you. 
 My estimation of humanity went down a notch when I read the reviews of this book.   The book is clumsily written, and uses cheap sentimental tricks to try to get us to swallow the shallow and ultimately dumb chunks of sophmoric philosophy.  That people can be charmed or even moved by this kind of bunk makes me sad, and also makes me realize how vulnerable people are, and how many would rather go for comforting and easy answers than actually think and confront the realities of the world.   And  no, I do not believe there was any such child. 
 You'll never get the straight story about nationalism out of Eric Hobsbawm, who himself appears to try to reconcile his own ethnic identity with the topic.  David Pryce-Jones once noted that in Hobsbawm's own autobiography: "he [Hobsbawm] boasts of a visit to Bir Zeit University on the West Bank to display solidarity with the Palestinians.  Why Palestinian nationalism is valid, and Jewish nationalism invalid, is something else Hobsbawm fails to analyze and explain. Quite crudely, he approves of nationalism in countries which proclaim themselves Communist and anti-American, like Cuba or Vietnam, while rejecting nationalism in countries which are not Communist and are pro-American, like Israel" ([...], Jan. 3, 2003).  Such twisted thinking is evident through "Nations and Nationalism," where Mr. Hobsbawm spares no effort, however subtle, to demean nationalism that doesn't conform to his pre-existing prejudices.  In short, when writing about nationalism, Mr. Hobsbawm allowed his considerable analytic and writing skills to become corrupted by his religion, communism.  Therefore, unless you are an acolyte of that religion, this book is not worth your time, money or effort to read, and if you *are* a member of that religion, I suggest you broaden your intellectual horizons a bit, perhaps by reading Liah Greenfield's "Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity" or Benedict Anderson's "Imagined Communities. 
 I read a lot of books and have been doing a number of reviews and this is one of the only books that I couldn't finish. After beginning to read this book I found that it just bounced all over the place. The book was not focused on anything or anyone in particular especially Andrew Jackson. If the book did focus on one thing in particular then it was details of the types of personalities some of the men around Jackson had, which I am not sure how one could be so familar with that not knowing any of the people personally. Sure you can learn something about personalities from letters but the detail about personality types was too much. Spending too much time on small detail does not make for great reading nor does it help one to see the big picture behind the story. So if what you like in a book is learning about personality types you will love this book.   The book also seemed to be written by a some what biased point of view by the author. The title should have been something like Politics in the early 1800's. This book will NOT keep your attention from one page to another. If you want to know more about Andrew Jackson spend your money on something else! 
 Chris Byron's schtick is to pretend to be a friend of Martha Stewart, but tell her story in the most cruel light.  No friend would write a book like this.  Hence, from the start one feels he is disingenuous while trying to establish his cred.  I am probably the one person in America who knows almost nothing about Martha Stewart, but Byron's account assembles such a string of digs that before long it gave me the feeling of being stuck in an elevator where someone had vomited. Why subject yourself to this?  I skipped ahead a few times trying to find a different tone, but the guy continues his vicious ways while feigning disinterested storyteller, and I finally had to throw it down.    I do not understand this writer's motivations for such unkindness.   This book makes me wonder about the value of all such book. By what standard is a book considered a good book? Does it inspire us?  Yes, it is well researched and well written... but so are so many others.  This book is disrespectful to a fellow human being and for what purpose?    With so many other books in my reading pile, I have to skip out and move to the next.       
 I was so anxious to read this after waiting so long for the 2nd book.  I loved White Oleander.  This book is psychotic and not much of a story.  Very disappointing from a talented author 
 I am very sad, This work is not art, I think this is [ The Worst Damn Thing ] An ugly and poor sound, She seems to be the lion which was totally tamed, The drying up of talent? I think that I want you to come back to a brilliant artist 
 I was the Medical Director of American Samoa a few years after Mead's six month in Ta'u, a village in the Manu'a group and spent over two years there. On my trips to Manu'a I found and talked to Chief Tufele and those Mead worked with. With two years study of Hawaiian I was able to converse with them quite easily. Mead studied Samoan for only six weeks in Pago Pago. There are many errors and self-projections in the work of a 23-year old girl fresh out of college on her first field trip, but not enough to incur Freeman's wrath. About half of his criticisms are not true 
 A simple plot about an ex-FBI officer forced by an old friend to infiltrate a Mob who murdered his son.Definitley not Arnie's best but it does have the odd good scene where his driving a convertable and shooting people at the same time while listening to the Rolling Stones "Satisfaction" but it was really corny how his car was riddled with bullets and didn't even get a flesh wound and of course he shot everyone.There wasn't many beautiful women in it and I think I prefer the shootout scene at the end of "Commando" to this.But I think he played his character reasonably well 
 It really is mostly about shame.  John Banville is a master of English prose.  His writing has a power and intensity, and originality that is matched by no other living writer that I know of.  All the more shame that his wonderful talent is wasted on this bloated, fatuous, ugly novel.  The main character "Axel" is an old, drunken, lecherous has-been scholar.  The romantic "other" is a hare-brained, weird, humorless woman.  (Indeed the entire novel is utterly humorless.)  And so on and on....  Nobody is likable or interesting; they are just pathetic.  Banville is unsurpassed in creating characters, living and riveting characters.  But who would want to spend their precious hours with these creeps that he creates in Shroud?  Not I, although I finished the book.  Maybe I just don't get it.  Undoubtedly I don't get it.  I don't want to get it.  I don't care.  Nothing about Shroud made me want to get it.    I liked The Untouchable by Banville.  That was a wonderful book.  This one stinks.  By the way, this book will really tune up your vocabulary skills.  There are more odd words here than in a spelling bee 
 I think Hemingway wanted to do two things:  (1) critique certain aspects of how WWII was fought (particularly the politicalization of battle plans); and (2) pay homage to his beloved Venice.  To do so, he crafted a fairly thin story about an old soldier who finds himself in one last love with a girl a fraction of his age.  The plot (to the extent there is one) and the relationship between the characters would probably make a nice short story.  The bulk of the book is taken up by tourist writing about Venice (locales, architecture, food, markets, layout, and, of course, the canals) and a journalist's rants about US generals in WWII.  Diehard Hemingway fans will find some jewels worth the read; others should stay away 
 If you're thinking of reading this book, let me save you some time--don't.  I like a good literary read as much as the next guy (really), and make it a point to read all the Pulitzer winners, but this book, in perfectly plain English, sucked.  There is no plot, no beginning, middle or end, and is so tedious and boring that I actually started reading it from the back forward.  It didn't help, but it didn't make a wit of difference either.  Do your self a favor and skip it 
 I found much of the humour in this movie to be downright silly and stupid.  In no way does this movie compare to others in the genre from the same period, such as "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" or "Sixteen Candles".  Just no comparison.  So I'm totally dumbfounded that many of the reviews here speak so highly of it.  If what I read is true, Cusack is very much justified in regretting participating in this movie.  It's a blemish on what has been a pretty good movie career so far 
 Why are you paying such good money for a no-calorie water?! How many calories does water have to begin with?! It would be interesting to see what the placebo was that they used in the double blind trial(?a cheeseburger?). Please do NOT buy this. Fill a bottle up at home and squeeze a bit of lemon juice in if you have to.... NO CALORIES! Give the money that you would have spend to charity. The makers of this water are thieves and con artists 
 i like how the people on here who turn to sarcasm when rating this cd think they're funny.  heh, so witty.  anywho i'm not a big fan of fall out boy, but there are a couple of good songs on this cd........notably grand theft autumn and saturday.  those are really the only two that hold up its rating for me tho...2 stars 
 If you know nothing about performance management this is your book. Simple, large letters, wide spacing and easy to read. A lot of general information together.  But if you are somewhat equiped in the field: don't buy this book. Not worth the trouble of buying. 
 A Dickens Christmas story is meant to be read in front of the fire with children gathered 'round. As configured in this particular ebook format you cannot do anything but sit in front of your screen and read ninety pages of nineteenth century prose. Not useful at all! This ebook would be far more usefull if, for example, you could copy or print it onto holiday paper. Since this story is in the public domain, blocking those options in this ebook is silly 
 The book in general is full of inaccuracies.  For example, the section on the Rokon Trail-breaker is mostly fiction.  The author attributes the creation of the Trail-breaker to J.B. Nethercutt and his two sons.  This is absolutely false.  Charles Fehn of Thousand Oaks, California invented it not the Nethercutts.  Nethercutt owned the company that was its first mass producer not its inventor 
 It was my first and it was quite disjointed. I didn't finish it. Not a beginner scifi book even though it may be a classic. Too weird for me 
 The first 25 or 30 chapters, Coben had me.  Not that his writing is really notable or even that great, but he is a master of drawing you in, then as each chapter ends, he reveals another tiny part of the mystery to propel you in to the next chapter.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that this novel basically fizzles out about half way through.  Improbable character motivations, unrealistic law enforcement situations, and the ultimate no-no, a convoluted plot that crashes and burns in the end.  I really wanted to like this book but the unbelievable writing ultimately sinks it 
 I expected to find some product placement (and there was), but had no idea that most of the book would be Dr. Perricone bragging about how much smarter he is than all other scientists and doctors and taking credit for other peoples' work!  There were also a lot of technical mistakes that I found (as a medical student) that make me wonder if he even understands the science that he claims to have discovered.  To top it all off, I received some of his products as a gift and they were terrible.  If you are interested in MD-formulated products, try MD skincare or Murad, both actually work (and, though I haven't read their books, they can't be worse) 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 After reading other reviews, I ordered this book. I've worked with SQL Server since version 4.2 and just wanted a resource for new features. I was very disappointed. I found very little of use.   Integration Services is new and I looked forward to the chapter on the topic. There is nothing in the book to explain the design or graphical use of SSIS. Everything is programatic. I followed it through the chapter. It was difficult to follow and to set up. When I got to the end of the chapter, it said data flow (a common use of SSIS) was beyond the scope of the chapter and referred the reader to Books Online.  My experience is that you might as well use Books Online as this book. I own many technical books. This one I sent back 
 The 9/11 commission report should be found in the fiction section of your local book store.    The current US administration has no qualms about "creating its own reality" and this is the most perfect example of this practice.  It was crafted to ignore any and all evidence that contradicted their fabricated "reality" and then used the conclusions of this report to support the current foreign policy.  I urge you to do your own research and not blindly believe what this report tells you.   Here are only a few of the many examples that prove that the 9/11 commission report lacks any credibility:  1.  NORAD changed their story about their actions on 9/11 significantly at least three times.  The report (or NORAD) does not examine or give any explanation why this happened.  In any case it is standard NORAD procedure to intercept a jet anywhere in the US within 10 minutes of a possible aircraft problem and yet none were intercepted in the 80 minutes following the first confirmed hijacking.  The report does not examine why standard procedure was not followed. It also claims there were no NORAD flights until after the pentagon strike.  Why not?      2.  Several of the "hijackers" are still alive and have been interviewed by the BBC claiming that their passports were stolen, and the report makes no mention of this fact.  3.  The book claims that the WTC towers had "a hollow steel shaft, in which elevators and stairwells were grouped".  This is outrageously false as the buildings had 47 massive steel central columns to support the building.  4.  World Trade Center Building 7 completely collapsed at virtually free fall speed and yet this building is not even mentioned anywhere in the report.  This building was the third in history to completely collapse due to fire in history.  The other two were the WTC twin towers which also collapsed near the speed of gravity.  Straight-down collapse at free fall speed is scientifically impossible unless controlled demolition is employed.  The fundamental law of physics "conservation of momentum" proves this fact.      5.  The report blatantly ignored prolific eyewitness testimony of multiple explosions in the WTC towers.  This includes an explosion in the North Tower basement before it was struck by a plane.  This event was tape recorded in a nearby office meeting along with dozens of eye witness reports.  The testimony to this fact was simply ignored and left out of the report by the commission.  See also the firefighter tapes that were blocked from being released to the public for years by the government as well as news footage from the day in question.  In the entire report the word "explosion" is not encountered one single time.  6.  The report also fails to mention that Marvin Bush (brother of the President), was in charge of security at not only the WTC complex, but Dulles international airport and United airlines.  The report fails to reveal who was involved in the massive insider trading just a few days before the attacks took place, only to claim that they had "nothing to do with Al Qaeda".    Philip Zelikow, the author of this report and executive director of the 9/11 commission is a member of the current administration, a close friend of Condoleezza Rice, and a co-author of the current terrorism policy "Catastrophic Terrorism: Elements of a National Policy".  Could there be a bigger conflict of interest here?  Need anything else be said?    In conclusion, it's not worth the paper it is printed on.   Anyone who still takes this report seriously should read: Dr. David Ray Griffin - "911 Commission Report: Omissions and Distortions"  Dr. Steven E. Jones - "Why indeed did the World trade center buildings completely collapse?"  Or watch these videos (currently available for free on Google video):  "Improbable Collapse: The Demolition of our Republic"  "9/11 Press for Truth"  "911 Mysteries - Demolitions 
 Considering the size of the book I was disappointed in the lack of information and meanings given. They are mostly one word meanings, if there is a meaning at all. Mostly it seems like it wants to take you in a big circle of reference from one name to the next never quite giving you what you are looking for. It wasn't helpful for me. I found "The Babyname Wizard" book A LOT more informative and helpful 
  Required reading for me as well and it was drivel. Pick anything but don't pick this book 
 I was raised in Virginia and never understood the details of the Battle of Yorktown. Now I see the big picture and how all the regional events in the glorious cause fit together. Immediately after finishing this book I returned to Yorktown with an entirely different understanding. I could relive the battle as if I had been there during the war. It was fascinating! I never learned this from history books.  Male Age 60 
 This novel is set in vaguely modern Britain (the precise date would be a spoiler) and deals with a charater who discovers that his upstairs neighbor believes himself to be the Man in the Iron Mask, both of history and of  Dumas' novel.  The action follows the character's increasing involvement in  and frequent resistence to this madman's fantasy world.  Likewise the  character is drawn into the madman's family life. Without getting specific,  the novel is about the "cantagiousness" of madness.  This is a  serious issue, but this is a modern novel and is mainly interested in the  question for "effect" and not in any philosophical way.  It is  well-written, and those who want no more from a novel than literary  in-jokes and surreal effects should find it thoroughly satisfactory. For my  tastes (and I do like the surrealism of Borges and Kafka, for example) the  book did not seem to be about real people; nor had it anything interesting  to say about Dumas; nor anything interesting to say about the historical  Iron Mask. I came away from this book feeling that it had been a pointless  exercise 
 I used this book in both my "introduction" to stochastic processes course as well as for a more advanced Markov chains class.  The book was VERY difficult to understand, and the notation does not aid in the explanation at all.  I found the material to be presented in an odd order and NOT AT ALL friendly for a beginner!  The material is very dense (I think that I covered perhaps 4 chapters during the course of my two semesters using this class), and does not reconcile intuition with the proofs.  The Markov chains portions of the book are more understandable than the stochastic processes portions (point processes, Poisson processes, etc).  I'd suggest both books by Sheldon Ross instead (the Introduction to Probability Models for beginners and the Stochastic Processes book for a beginning graduate student or beyond).  I now use my copy of this book for a doorstop 
 Admittedly, I am not a big fan of the mystery genre, but I do read them from time to time.  This book was my first foray into Christie, and will almost certainly be my last.  This book was highly recommended by a friend who, up until now, has been right on the mark in terms of suggested reading.  I mentioned to him that I preferred mysteries where there are enough clues throughout that the reader can try to figure out who the murderer is on his or her own.  My friend warned me that Christie is decidedly not like that; in fact, I think his wording was "she cheats: she'll introduce a crucial clue in the last few pages that the characters should have known all along."  However, he said that if I can get past that -- and I can -- the total was greater than the sum of the parts in that all other aspects of her books made up for this subjective stumbling point. With that, he told me her best book was "And Then There Were None," so I checked it out.  Like I said, this is the first bad call I've seen him make.   At no point did this book actually pique my interest, let alone hold it. Characters began dying, and I couldn't care less about them one way or another. The fact that the title tells you the book's pattern didn't help. Less than half way through, I was consciously aware that I was reading on just to finish it and get it over with.  That is NOT a good sign.     My major complaint, though, is her prose.  Very rushed, dry, sparse in description, and completely unengaging. Stylistically, she makes a number of remedial faux pas, which at first were mildly irritating but became more grating as the book trudged on.  The most egregious example is exclamation mark overkill: the first chapter alone averaged two or three a page. Just from that I would have guessed that this was one of her first books, as her style struck me as amateurish and unpolished, but to my surprise she wrote this well into her career.   Obviously, and for reasons currently beyond me, Christie has a large fan base.  I don't doubt they'd say that I'm either missing something or am an unenlightened philistine who "doesn't get it."  However, a prime sign of a *good* book is if a relative outsider like me can come in on it cold and go with it.  That obviously failed here, and I cannot recommend this book, except to Agatha fanboys or someone looking for a sick drinking game -- take a shot every time she uses an exclamation mark.  Be warned if you try that, though: you'll have cirrhosis of the liver 10 pages into it.  In all candor, the more I thought about this book, the more it annoyed me - I wouldn't have written such a harsh review otherwise 
 Tons of statistical data supporting the concept of low cost index funds.  I am invested in the Vanguard S&P 500 Index as well as other index funds, but this is a bit too much.  If you understand the concept of indexing, save some cash and skip this book 
 This might be the most painful Yes DVD yet just released last Month (03/07).   This is the classic Yes lineup back together since 2002. You wouldn't have known by the Evenings lackluster performance. What pressure they must be under to make a DVD. We should have got a new CD recording in 03.   You can see the stress on the Band. Jon Anderson who sounds like he is Sick, has his eyes shut or is squinting the entire night. The exception, when he glances over at his Lyrics Screen.   Rick Wakeman, tick free since he stopped drinking was ticking like a time bomb. He didn't tick in Concert in 2002 nor 2004. No smiles too. Looked great though!  Chris Squire was on fire, made the Show!.    Steve Howe. Something was wrong, yet he played strong all night long.   Alan White was there too. They all were just there, doing a Gig.   Don't waste Money on this new 2007 Release. I rented this online!.       
 This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative 
 One of the worst war movies and one of the worst Vietnam war movies ever. If you want to see a better one made at about the same time, see Burt Lancaster in "Go Tell the Spartans". If you ever wonder about how clueless some people can be about history and world events, this should pretty much explain it 
 Do not be tricked into buying an "easy" sharpener. They DO NOT work. Spend the same money (or less!) on a good stone set that has various angles (i.e. Lansky, w/ 17, 20, 25, and 30 degree angles, and 3-5 stones: use 20 degrees for your "slicing" and paring knives, and 25 degrees for you chefs). I opted for the stone set (I'm a bit of a purist), but I've heard good remarks about the diamond set, too; the 3 grit set is all you really need: coarse, medium, and fine - get the ultra fine if your sharpening razors and such.  With proper care, and light steel use (it's the re-aligning tool, not the sharpening device - be gentle), you'll probably only need to touch-up your edge once every year or two, depending on the work load you put on your knife. But, if you do seriously muck the edge up, you'll have a system that can repair your knife to "good as new" condition.  My chef fell onto the tile floor, point first, and I had a wonderfully sharpened instrument 30 minutes later. The normal touch-up takes less than 5 minutes per blade.  And, at thirty dollars to have 5 knives professionally sharpened, you'll be ahead of the game after the first use!  Hint: use a 5X+ magnifying glass/loupe to inspect your edge - by carefully rolling the knife to catch a bright light source, you'll be able to see shiny spots where the edge still needs to be sharpened. You can also take a look at your edge before using the steel, and see how bad you roll the edge while working with it, then see how it becomes magically aligned after the use of the steel. And, see chips and voids in your lower quality steel knives - I admit I have a couple, myself.  In short: get stoned, not taken 
 Be warned!  This book is not about science!  I don't know know who this Henry Miller fellow is but he doesn't know anything about geography.  Imagine my surprise when I purchased this book--expecting to read about the earth's different latitudal circles--and discovered it has nothing to do with the Tropic of Cancer or any other latitudal lines!  In fact, the so-called "author" can't even seem to WRITE in a linear fashion!  I've heard that this "author" has a book about the Tropic of Capricorn out but I'm willing to bet that that one has nothing to do with latitude either!  
 This book reads as though it was written by the staff from the television show, "The View".  Jez... 
 I bought this book at the recommendation of my favorite magazine...Good thing I used a gift certificate and didn't waste my own money.  I gave it 2 stars, but maybe it's worth 2.5 stars-just for the effort. It does have some good ideas, but for the people like me, who love to organize but just don't have the space, it's not that useful. I was expecting more ideas about how to use the space I have. Unfortunately, I usually have better and more creative ideas than the author. Another major "-" is that the book talks a lot about throwing stuff away; well, what I have to say to that is that I periodically do that anyway, and I still am space challenged. That's not the solution to every problem 
 I'm giving this book 2 stars because it did keep me entertained for a short while. Then, like many other reviewers, I began to get bored of all of her complaining and whining.  But the ending....horrible!!  I was left feeling bewildered & felt like perhaps my book had some pages left out of it.  The authors did a very poor job of tying up loose ends.  What happened to her and HH?   Also, she mentions that she needs to find a job using her degree, a whole section is even devoted to describing one interview.  Then, the only thing you ever here about her job hunting again is a one sentence reply during a dinner party???? What????  Did we miss something?  I was extremely disappointed and would encourage you to pass this one up 
 We already owned a different HoMedics sound machine and it's far better than this one.  The volume control doesn't work well at all on this machine; either far too low or way too loud and there was lots of static, no matter where we used the machine.  The product seemed very flimsy as well.  We ended up returning it and will spend more for a better machine 
 This is the first time I've read a book from the Cat in the Hat Learning Library, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But I wasn't expecting this.  The illustrations make it look like the kids and the cat are having an adventure in the rainforest. But they aren't. They're just on a field trip, I guess.  The book goes over the four levels of the rainforest and names the different types of animals, plants, and people you would find in a rainforest. The main focus of the book seems to be maintaining the rhyme scheme rather than giving detailed information. At times, clarity is even sacrificed in order to maintain the rhyme. For example, "Millions of acres of land every year are cut down..." Cutting down land is confusing to a child. Usually trees or plants are cut down.  One funny thing was that the cat in the hat says he will give you a prize if you find these six things. Well, he's talking to the kids he is traveling with, not "you" the reader. So my 5-year-old son jumped in and named the things, then said "Where's my prize?"  So after around 40 pages of naming and discussing rainforest plants, animals, and people, a bulldozer showed up on the second to last page and the animals are running for their lives. On the last page the cat in the hat says "Save these trees please!" The end. Well, I like the environmental theme, but I had an awful lot of explaining to do when the bulldozer showed up. I think the book should have begun where it ended, because that is where the real story is. I buy books for my kids in the hope that the author can explain and illustrate a topic better than I can.  My son only asked me to read this book once, then never picked it up again.   I gave the book two stars for the unusual format. The novelty might appeal to some kids. 
 I didn't have high expectations for this movie, yet it still managed to completely disappoint me.  I adore Robin Williams, and his performance was the best part of the movie.  But the script was abysmal and Sara, played by Marcia Gay Harden, was a completely one dimensional character.  The antics of the sidekick robot and the "flubber" itself were just plain embarrasing to watch.  Too bad, because the idea is great - but frankly, the original was pretty bad too. They really could have done so much with this story either the first OR the second time around 
 This was Rand's first work of nonfiction, and it is supposed to be an introduction to her philosophy of Objectivism. But it is certainly not the best place to start. The book consists of one rather lengthy essay, followed by excerpts from her four novels. As expected, more pages are devoted to excerpts from Atlas Shrugged than to any of the other novels - in fact, than to all of the others put together. Galt's seventy-plus page speech is included in its entirety.  Unfortunately, the excerpts aren't as interesting outside the context of the novels. Even worse, the title essay is probably the weakest Rand ever wrote. In it, Rand attempts to explain all of history in terms of the two types of men who have dominated it, Attila and the Witch Doctor. Attila represents those who have ruled men by force, whereas the Witch Doctor represents the irrational mystics who have controlled men's minds. The whole thing is just plain ridiculous.  If you want to know what Rand thought, you'd be better off starting with The Virtue of Selfishness, followed by Capitalism: the Unknown Ideal. 
 For a 270 page book that focuses on only one subject, "The Homocysteine Revolution" should have included much more iformation on what a person should DO in order to have favorable Homocysteine levels -- especially when it comes to diet and other lifestyle habits.    I bought this book for my father, and he and I were very dissapointed that the book for the most part negelcted this important matter, other than advising people to take B-12, B-6, and Folic Acid supplememnts.  
 I thought this would be funny or at least informative. All it is is stories about the author and other women about how they panicked over turning 30 and how their friends and families reacted to their choices. I found it difficult to finish 
 This year, 60% of college entries will be female.  Look at this spring's honor role listings.  Last year, 78% of honor role members in my community were female.  Schools are fails boys - not girls.  If you wish to waste your time on a politically correct diatribe that is full of anecdotal and subjective pap, then get this book.  If you want to really improve the quality of education, there are thousands of reads better than this 
 If the observed complexity of biological processes is an argument for an intelligent designer, then the designer must have been more complicated than the design.  So... who designed the designer?  Intelligent Design: R.I.P.  This problem of infinite regress is typical of the sloppy, pseudo-scientific worldview of the creationists (and make no mistake about it, that's what the I.D. people are).  In order to gain respectibility, they set up what appears to be a scientific axiom: everything must come from something.  But the power of an axiom is that it must be true in all cases, and the creationists then immediately add an exception: God didn't have to come from anything, he was always here.  This is certainly faith.  Just don't call it science, and don't call creationists scientists.  And don't try to use laughable arguments like these against the powerfully explanatory idea of evolution.  Virtually all of the arguments advanced by the enemies of Darwinism fall apart in the hands of people who actually understand what the modern theory of evolution actually says, and what the mechanisms of evolution actually are (the fact that someone like Behe believes that his "mousetrap" argument is convincing shows that he really does not understand evolutionary theory at all. 
 Hopelessly misguided.  Overwhelmingly biographical.  Smartly directed.  Al Gore's never ending struggle to prove that mankind is destroying the earth and that the solution is international governmental control and primitive living reared its ugly head on the silver screen earlier this year and is now available on DVD!  Beware, though - that DVD is made of plastic, which is derived from a number of chemical compounds including - (gasp!) - oil.  The recipe for the movie, however, is 1 part science, 3 parts personal anecdotes, and 4 parts slideshow fun!  Mr. Gore has taken the liberty of inventing a scientific consensus (this is, of course after he invented the internet) on which to start his new campaign for president.  His movie is almost entirely about his own life.  A fair amount is devoted to his current struggle to advance the environmental movement, and what is left over is a small amount of very misleading science.  It isn't, necessarily, bad science - it is just far from representational.  However, I won't waste this review debating the scientific ideas advanced by Mr. Gore - there are plenty of other scientists and resources for that.  What needs to be recognized about this movie is that it is a campaign video and not an educational documentary.  There are components of informative dialogue and presentations, but this is really all about Al Gore, not global warming.  There is more discussion of how his political opponents have got in his way and in the way of his message than there is of actual solutions to the "problem."  This is my big criticism.  The movie masquerades as a documentary to advance an environmental cause when it really intends to advance Al Gore's availability for political office.  Even in that light it still operates dishonestly.  Mr. Gore chastises the Bush administration for refusing to take action to stop global warming.  However, even when Gore was running the country with Bill Clinton, they did nothing.  In fact, Gore's proclamation in the movie that he tried diligently to get Kyoto passed but was stopped by the Republicans is bogus.  The Clinton administration found the protocol unworkable and challenged the fact that it only bound a few nations to action without timetables.  They never even submitted it to the Senate for ratification.  In this fashion, the movie continues with one dishonest claim after another.  In the end, the movie is full of misleading science and statistics, complete lies and fabrications, and it focuses more on the nobility of Gore than on any perceived global issue.  The only thing that makes me give it a second star is the fact that it was smartly directed and well edited.  The message that the movie intended to convey comes across loud and clear and with style - it's just not a message that anyone should hear or trust 
 These activities have many, many steps and feature directions such as this: "In the next step, students will transfer their tracings to the second sheet of drawing paper and place it scrap paper. Using the edge (not tip), press down and rub heavy solid lines behind the lines of the drawings or fill in the whole space. In effect, students will be creating their own carbon paper." Rub heavy lines on the back of the drawing paper (the back is never mentioned again), the tracing paper? the scrap paper? I don't know... It's extremely unclear. This book has some impressive looking activities but uses a lot of technical terms and seems way too complicated for the bottom of the 2-5 grade range that's on the cover. I would recommend this only for teachers with a very strong background in art working with grades 4-8. It also talks about how many "class periods" activities take, as if the author wrote it for middle school but the publishers just slapped grades 2-5 on the cover. Very disappointing... 
 There is a lot of traffic in Rome.  Especially on the "raccordo annulare", where accidents  are also frequent. The traffic is noisy and dirty, especially when it rains.  Romans swear when they drive and also when they don't.  There are many American tourists in Rome,  especially around the fountains in the piazzas,  where they cluster and sing American songs.  Italian men hit on women tourists, who resist their advances.    "Se vedi gente che lavora, allora non e` Roma".  Romans do not work. No, some of them do, and, in fact, morning till night.   But Rome is not what it used to be.  Everybody knew each other and was polite,  while now everybody is rushed and rude.  Besides, the free love of today has substituted  the brothels of yesterday.  Yes, some of the brothels were chic, while others less so.   Rome was bombed in the Second World War. In fact,  bombing would sometimes interrupt a theatrical  performance. The public then proceeded to the  shelter, where flirting and lovemaking would ensue.   The Roman aristocracy is close to the Papal Court.  They run parties together, even fashion shows.  Cardinals complain that outsiders try to teach the Pope  how to rule the Church.   And, yes! Motoryclists can and do go around the  Colosseum, providing a tasteless final sequence.   One leaves the cinema with a heavy sense of wasted time.   Does Fellini really have nothing at all to say  about the Eternal City? After all his years there? Nothing except the  standard collection of stereotypes  about Italians, stereotypes that occur in every  scurrilous joke, that are met on the pages of every trashy guide?    It is true that there are a few nice sequences, especially  the often mentioned one of the destruction of the frescoes.    And then, the great Anna Magnani appears for about 10 seconds to tell Fellini she won't talk to him.    That is perhaps also a scene worth watching.   But the rest is commercial cinema.   "Vai a dormi', Federico".    
 I am an eighth grader taking Geometry, so it is obviously advanced.  However, this book is not helpful AT ALL in learning.  It is so frustrating to not even have a glossary in the back to find definitions, and the book does a very bad job of explaining tough concepts.  If you are a teacher, please try a different book 
 Barber's analysis ignores important facts in order to prove his thesis about how the primary battle in the world being between the free market and religious fundamentalism. It works, somewhat, but fails to take into account numerous instances where this tension is called into question. Not every zealot in the world is an enemy of technology, as the War in Iraq has shown us. 
 Flowery. Verbose. Rambling. Compound sentence upon compound sentence. This book was unreadable for me. I quit 
 I liked this even less than the jingoistic, "glory of war" stuff.  I'm still looking for the serious study that views the world as a hard place, recognizes that for a large part of the Middle East, America is a symbol of evil, and criticizes American public policy from the perspective of the tensions of imperfect knowledge and dire threat 
 After reading the 1st book in the series and knowing "whodunit" throughout most of the book, I thought I would give this series another shot.  About 50 pages into the book I knew who the criminal was.  I never finished this series.  However, I have enjoyed other books by Terri Blackstock 
 I got this light before the LED lights started coming out in the retail channel.  Those lights tend to almost be too bright, but they have the advantage of running for ages on tiny batteries.  Unfortunately, this light uses 4 AA batteries which makes it fairly hefty.  It alternatively can operate on an AC adapter.  This makes it lighter, but it's still bulky because of the battery compartment.  The Good: The light is nicely bright with a natural quality that's easy on the eyes. It has a ratcheting arm so you can put it where you want and it stays there (better than most of the flexible arm ones) Includes an AC adapter slot (though no AC adapter) Can help weigh down lighter books to keep the pages from turning Nice large clamp for attaching to books. Lamp shade which allows you to throw the light where you want without blinding your vision. Decent quality plastic - Made in China  The Bad: No brightness adjustment. Heavy (can be a benefit in some cases) and makes holding up a book all the more tiring. Bulky - Makes it really hard for a book to sit properly in your hand. The ratcheting mades a loud click which can wake your wife in bed.  :-) The clip has very limited strength and seems to slip easily. Eats up batteries fairly quickly - I use rechargeables in it now.  I'm giving it an even 2 because it's a pain to use, really.  Hopefully I can find a light weight LED clip-on which has a brightness adjustment with a quiet arm that stays in place and most importantly - natural lighting.  If so, I'll review it on here - but most LEDs wash out the page making it hard to read.  The nice quality lamp is the only reason this one doesn't get 1.5 stars 
 This book was an enjoyable story, but it had many points that did not hold my attention. I also could not find much interest in the book due to the fact that it was a tedious story. Many points got boring and I would have trouble concentrating. This is just an average book. I would only reccomend it to a middle-school reader. 
 This movie suck...first the comedy is not even funny, they'll do anything to make you laugh. The acting is horrible, the fight scene suck, none of these actor know how to fight. Princess Phoenix is the most annoying person in the world. Avoid this movie at all cost 
 For people that had tryed many ways to lose weight, that book is useless because contain no new information about how to do it. The method is less food, low calories and more exercise, just it. It has a few informations that can help understand how the metabolism works. 
 This book is very wordy, the author tends to use French and Italian phrases without translation. The book's cryptic explanations and definitions must be tediously read and re-read, since they do not appear to follow any pattern. Hughes is a pretentious attention seeker. This book is not for anyone outside art students 
 If you wanna hear an alright guy, check out Todd Snider, who wrote the track and played it 100 times better (IMHO). I think it's bare-faced cheek of this guy not only to do a bad cover of Todd's song but also use the name as the album title. I do not think he is an alright guy (musically speaking). I think he's just one more of these guys who think if they wear a cowboy hat and play "radio-friendly" music (pap), they'll make it big. Unfortunately, he may be right. Garth Brooks anyone? Do me a favour! There is so much good stuff out there, why waste your money on this? Buy Todd Snider instead, or John Prine, or Steve Earle, or Guy Clark, or.. 
 With great anticipation, I purchased this CD but it came in some obscure "Super Audio CD" format by Sony. It is unplayable on my CD player and unreadable on my laptop. The Amazon product description does not designate this. Bummer. Now I have to go through some return/replace hassle 
 While I enjoyed "Unto the Sons", and may read Talese's other works, I only thought so-so of this endless tome on the sex industry in the USA. I like his style of writing non-fiction in an engrossing manner, like reading a novel. His section on Noyes and the Oneidan community was wonderful. Then there is Hugh Hefner, who has sexual relationships with countless women, but was hot and bothered when his wife had an affair. And Talese's nine-year commitment to the work is highly commendable. But the scope of such a work needed more/wider coverage. The selection of scenes were few, and overdone. Not much on Masters & Johnson, or Sheryl Hite (sp.?) or Alfred Kinsey. The material on judicial matters, while important was tedious. Sandstone Retreat was saturated with coverage as well. After "Unto the Sons", a wonderful work on Italo-Catholics, who, like me, have roots in southern Italy, this was a let down. Catholicism becomes a punching bag in this work. He might have set up a thesis - antithesis dialogue about the understanding behind Pope Paul VI's "Humanae Vitae", but didn't do that either. In the end he speaks of his italian Catholic background as a means to help him live in a licenteous, heathenistic manner, one that nearly rips his marriage apart. Very strange. 
 This one will help you go to sleep for sure. This is my second attempt at Ross MacDonald and I give up. Endings are a given, no surprises here 
 I'll be succinct.  Don't waste your money buying this book.  Don't waste your time reading it.  This is a smart-alec's attempt at humor.  It betrays his deep-ingrained English bigotry towards the Irish and Catholics 
 The repeller works fine at repelling, but when on the "rodent" setting it makes an audible chirping noise that's annoying so it can be used only in remote locations where people don't normally go.  The reason we bought this model was because it can run on batteries and we wanted it for an outer shed, but the manual says that it'll only run two or three days on battery power, making it absolutely worthless for this use 
 T. is my favourite composer but the interpretation on this CD is rather like a good effort in high shoo 
 If you like nude guys wrestling each other for 1 whole hour then this is your movie there is no after  scene like in a hot steamy shower. Just nude guys wrestling I thought it was boring 
 I have read many (probably too many) books on Jackie Kennedy Onassis, and while few of them have taught me anything new, I have never before been bored by the material. Well, there's a first time for everything. If you're an avid Jackie biography reader, there's no reason to peruse "What Jackie Taught Us." The writing is very simple, dull and SO repetitive. (Why did Flaherty feel the need to describe Jackie's parents' personalities the same way again and again?) If you just *have* to pick this one up, only read the last section of each chapter while enjoying a coffee in a book store. Save your money. I also have to ask... What in the world made Flaherty think she should write a Jackie biography? 
 God these poesurs couldn't be anyworse. Whats funny is that travis barker is getting a divorce!! He sucks!! 
 I've seen the phrase "slice of life" used many times to describe this movie, which makes me wonder - whose life is this a slice of? Certainly not mine, and not most people's. The Anniversary Party is a slice of the lives of a group of people who are extremely vain, self-absorbed, jaded and rich beyond most people's wildest fits of imagination. Worse, there isn't much of a hint that the filmmakers were aware that most people, or at least most people who are fun to be around, don't act the way these characters do.   Good films can be made about Hollywood - in "Mulholland Drive" it's kind of a dream world, both in the sense that it's hazy and ambiguous and in the sense that one of its characters dreams of being a bigger part of it; in "State and Main," the self-absorption of many of the characters is offered for our amusement. "The Anniversary Party" is presented as if most viewers will be sympathetic with the characters, but I can't imagine them elicting much sympathy from anyone who isn't also a bored rich prick. If this is truly a "slice of life" for the Hollywood set, it is no wonder that so many films produced in Hollywood are so cynical and shallow.  
 The book was informative, however it lacked a certain sophistication which left many questions unanswered. Not enough time dedicated to flowers 
 Eleanor Roosevelt is truly a fascinating character, but this book is absolutely painful to read.  Cook makes references to topics before addressing them, makes characters difficult to follow, and generally botches what could be a great subject.  Look elsewhere for Eleanor Roosevelt 
  The thesis of this book is that the 9-11-01 terrorist attacks wouldn't have happened if it weren't for Bill Clinton's mistakes. That is incorrect. The 9-11-01 terrorist attacks wouldn't have happened if it weren't for G.W. Bush's mistakes. 9-11 could have easily been prevented. The CIA and the FBI were giving Bush thorough warnings about how Bin Laden was a potential threat to the U.S. and the White House had documents that plainly stated "Bin Laden determined to attack in the U.S." Bush was on vacation the whole time that he could've been looking into that. Instead, he decided he would rather be out golfing and fishing than preventing an assault on American soil. Condoleeza Rice, the then national security advisor, now Secretary of State, committed perjury at the 9-11 Commission by saying under oath that the documents said that Bin Laden was not determined to attack in the U.S. When in fact the documents said the exact opposite.   I do not recommend this book.    
 Rodney Dangerfield is supposedly becoming mormon(Church of Jesus Christ)  but this movie didn't get any fact right.  the church is never mentioned by name for a reason.  polygamy.  look like Amish.  a collection plate?  this movie stinks and i'm very offended 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 The book jacket says that the book's DVD-ROM will work with Xpress DV 3.0 and higher. The .omf video files were compressed at 20:1 using Media Composer and Xpress DV 4.6 does not support the 20:1 resolution, meaning that the sample video files cannot be imported and used in Xpress DV 4.6. This is a shame, because it seems like a good book and this is not really a problem that the author could have foreseen. Unfortunately, most places won't let you return a book after the DVD has been opened, so let this be a warning, FYI. Hopefully the upcoming 3rd edition will fix this problem 
 This novel has some campy appeal since it introduces us to the famous Sam Spade, the morally ambiguous, hard drinking, but devastatingly attractive private eye.  The rest of the characters in this short novel don't amount to much, and as a result I didn't find the plot of much interest either.  I have to believe that this novel was voted onto the Radcliffe List at least partly on the strength of the movie that was based on it 
 Not good for larger houses. Ours picks up radio signals sometimes 
 Nice, fun, but superficial book which makes heroes of treasure hunters who destroyed half of the artifacts that they were digging for because of poor technique, put thousands of years old treasure around their wife's neck to take a picture, and secretly smuggled entire treasures out of the country where they were found (read: Schliemann).  Does not mention scholars who built their work on other scholars' work but took all the credit.  This would be a good book for a child under 12, but for anyone older than that, it is too much "popular" and not enough "science" and does make heroes out of antiheroes 
 I hated "Green Mars"! This book is easily one of the worst pieces of tripe I've ever read. "Red Mars" was a decent book and I had high hopes that "Green Mars" would be equally good or better, but boy-oh-boy was I wrong. Where to start? First it was boring and tedious. "Red Mars" at least kept a half-way decent pace, with imporant or interesting events happening every couple of chapters or so. I can scarely think of one in the whole of "Green Mars". Instead of focusing on the sorts of interesting happenings taking place on a planet in the process of being terraformed, Robinson instead used this book as a soap-box for enviromentalism and anti-capitalist crap. It consisted of people that were either anti-terraforming (that seems to be totally insane to me), communists (or socialists, or eco-socialists or whatever), or people with any other number of weird political stances. I got half-way through and simply threw my hands up in disgust. Never touch this book 
 Typical story of the woman who gets dumped by her husband for a more exciting woman.  This one bakes bread to "heal" and meets another guy and Yupee every thing is super again...  
 I bought and downloaded the eBook of this famous book for my research. It is NOT usable. Most of the text is missing. I have never seen such a bad scanning result. Unbelievable. 
 Not what I was looking for, small print and not easy shortcuts. I know how to do the math the long method.  I was looking for things you can do in your head for a rough estimate 
 If you want a greatest hits package from Reba McEntire, get her first or her second one.  This one contains mostly pop tripe from when she all but abandoned country music to "do what sells".  This collection is phony...just like the lady herself.  
 Through the book I felt that the author was not able to grab me with the emotional intensity that he was going for.  I never could quite buy into the whole "The Big Pharma's Are All Bad."  I did really like the end of the book.  I felt a real connection and love between him and his wife, even though she had passed away.  The author also let's us know what is going to happen:  he will be killed also.  Then he lets the protagonist Jason discover it for himself.  When he is closest to his wife, at the place she was killed, and closest to her cause.  Le Carre points an accusing finger at the US in his book and end notes, but provides little detail to support his accusations.  In fact, BIg Pharma is multinational.  Some of the largest like Bayer are German.  These are the companies that helped gas the Jews.  Looking for an atrocity?  Why not let us write about documented proven suffering without writing books about fictional conspiracy theories, which by his own admission at the end of the book do not exist.  I feel he has an axe to grind with these people.  My Opinion:  Big Pharma gets a bad rap.  I think I owe my life to a monoclonal antibody called rituxan:    Rituxan® (Rituximab) is a unique therapy that works by selectively depleting CD20+ B-cells. B-cells, and their role in Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and Rheumatoid Arthritis, have been an area of intensive research by scientists around the world, and at Genentech and Biogen Idec. Rituxan affects your immune system by selectively targeting CD20+ B-cells shown to play an important role in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and rheumatoid arthritis.  Side effects?  Oh it had side effects all right.  It cured my knee problems (which I assume to be arthritis) at the same time it cured my cancer.  The old treatment?  Well CHOP Chemotherapy which I also got killed my memory and without the synergistic effect of Rituxan I would probably have relapsed by now.  I just think Big Business gets a bad rap in general from the liberal communist crowd and it is just not that way.  You have to take the good and the bad with all systems.  What would LeCarre have us put in place?  A system where the Government does all the research?  No Thanks.  My belief is I would be dead.  Since I believe it, it's true.  I'll take my chances with Big Pharma.  Meanwhile the weak minded soak up LeCarre's stories like they are fact, then point the finger at the multinationals, when it is all taken so grossly out of proportion.  So in telling well crafted lies which he terms fiction, LeCarre makes his living and in his way bilks the reader and does a disservice to the patient's suffering.  That's one way of looking at it anyway.  What system does he propose?  Communism?  No thanks we have been there and done that haven't we?  Don't get me wrong I liked the book and really want to see the movie.  It brought out the tragic beauty of Africa and the beauty of the depth of some of the relationships.  But I think there was a large dose of propaganda thrown in to boot 
 I really liked this when it came ut on vinyl, but in retrospect, it was the cause, not the music. B. Raitt is grand, G Nash with an excellant Cathedral, J C Young, and the highlight to me We Almost Lost Detroit by the great Gil Scott-Heron. But the second disc is second rate. Edit the filler and it rates higher 
 It could be a really good book with lots of insights to provide; however, it failed to grap my attention with the draggy way of writing. It came on as boring as ever, I even tried to pick a few topics which I might be interested in to read, to no avail. It was too painstakingly boring and lengthy to go to a point, if there's even a point, I just couldn't sustain long enough to get there. I have no doubt that it is a great book in self-help, just not my kind 
 There is certain type of naivet that the women in JG novels tend to have that just doesn't work in a modern setting.  And though you could maybe say that an Alfa male is an alfa male in any era, she manages to make them predictably boring.  After a while it just seems like you're reading about the same saccharin sweet characters over and over and over again.  I was a huge fan of her historicals.  And though I have remained faithfull reader so far, I think this book marks the end of the road for me.  Unless, I'm terribly desperate for something to read.  :)  If JG completely refuses to go back to historicals, then maybe she could try Futuristic novels where the virgin planet gets invaded by maurauding males.  Just a thought.  : 
 Worst band to ever come out of the hardcore scene and pretty much the death knell of melodic-hardcore in the 90s. After these soft Weezer wannabe charlatans it was all downhill. It's baffling how Jade Tree went from releasing the Swiz discography to putting out these guys.  These guys are only notable for having a split 7" with the far superior Texas Is The Reason. Buy the self titled Texas Is The Reason ep on Revelation instead and live your life in hapiness knowing you have the one truely great release which came outta that whole sub-scene 
 To be sure, this album has some beautiful cuts. But that is overshadowed for me by the fact that while megastars Bartoli and Bocelli are featured so prominently on the cover, THEY ONLY SING ON 4 OUT OF 16 TRACKS. This kind  of misleading advertising is reprehensible. If I hadn't purchased this  while on vacation, I would have returned i 
 This is quite possibly the most poorly written book I have ever seen. Like others on this site I will never again read a DS book. Talk about repetitive -- it got so bad that I began to underline everytime the main love interest was referred to as a "wacky artist". Between Chapters 5 and 7 the term was used 15 times, three times on one page. To make it worse, the "wacky artist" is also characterized as extremely immature and childlike, making him very unappealing to me, anyway. In the space of 3 pages the following phrases appear -- "looked like a big kid", "she felt like his mother", "his childlike style" "he was very needy sometimes, and self-centered, as children are", "he acted like a bored schoolboy", "pouting", "acted out, more often than not, like a child". What a bore. Both the book and the people in it 
 The author makes the hypothesis that Edicaran fauna are distinct from other multicellular animals and that they underwent a different type of embryological development.  The book presents no real scientific test of  these ideas.  Instead appeals to over extended analogies and conjecture 
 If you can understand this book you are obviously incapable of living in  the real world. Sassen's dense, turgid writing style simply aims to  bewilder the reader into unquestioningly accepting her doomsday view of  socitey. Most depressing reading 
 Chose this guidebook over others as much to check out the Frommer's style as to get travel info. Normally I am a Lonely Planet guy, but since I was staying with friends didn't need a lot of in depth descriptions of logistics (lodging, travel etc.). Just looking for a description of some of the attractions.  I found the guide difficult to use. Although I didn't need much in the way of logistical support, there was really very little. There were only about 4 maps in the whole book and they were spaced out all over the place. Virtually no information on specifics for those arriving overland. Worse, the descriptions of the attractions any sense of enthusiasm. Normally when I read a guidebook, I get the sense that sites are over-hyped, but this book almost made me want to skip the city altogether.   I have found Frommers on-line a good source of info and reviews but won't be buying another of their guidebooks in the future 
 Ordinarily, I would not take the time to write a review, but if I could get my money and time back for having purchased and read this book, I would.  I love Terry Jones' work, along with the rest of the Pythons, and I was excited when the book arrived. I expected something entertaining, and at least insightful, but what I got was one rant, retold a dozen slightly different ways.  It's all based on one web site spelling out some possible right wing conspiracy, and the fact that one web site is cited again and again...and again makes me wonder what the publishers thought they had to work with? At the very least, *do not* pay full retail price for this turkey, buy it used or check it at the library 
 As a student I was excited to find so many new ideas in one place.  However, when faced with writing a review of the ideas in this book, I needed to review my finance and accounting texts.  If you want to be up on  the popular terminology read this book.  If you want to reinvent your  financial office look somewhere else 
 I must admit that I am a guy and that I bought this movie before seeing it. I was not shocked with the horrible acting, but was surprised with the hot stars. This movie had both hot guys and girls. The actor that caught my eye was Steven Albrecht "Freddy", he is so hot. We get see him completely nude showing off his hot body.  He did a great job in his breif scene. Josh Edwards "Trian" was okay to look at too. As for the actress...Venesa Taylor is also hot 
 There is a serious design flaw with this camera and it is even acknowledged on the FAQ section of the Sony website.  "If there are dust particles floating in the air, they can be illuminated by the strong light of the flash and sometimes appear in a recorded image as white, round glare spots.  This symptom tends to occur in low-light environments when using a compact digital camera due to the close proximity of the flash to the lens assembly.  However, this is not a malfunction."  READ:  your low-light pictures will have spots all over them!  Sony does not think this is a problem.  It is a design flaw. If you are only going to use this camera in full sun, then it is fantastic but seriously, there are many other cameras out there that do a much better job!   
 Crudely written. A negative hero deserves better and Wharton has written some fine books. Sadly, not this one. 
 Was a little hard putting it together.  You have to be very careful taking the cds out or it would fall apart.  I am not happy with this product 
 This a good book for those who have yet to venture in the zoo of the personal medical investigation.  However, for those hoping for more specific help in the MS specifics of identification MS, solutions, and who to see it --this book does fall short 
 Okay, I read this book end-to-end. Disappointing though. The contents are not close to what you find in the Project+ exam. The heading, subheading and paragraphs are not coherent and they do not tie together. It is hard to find out, in few paragraphs, what author is trying to tell. Chapter summaries are disorganized and sometime do not cover what is in the chapter. Some of the figures do not make sense (see figure 6-5 on page 189...do you really need to create a figure to tell Arguments take a project off schedule and increase costs) 
 If you're looking for ammunition to disprove popular conspiracy theories this is not the book you need.  This book is primarily concerned with Christian conspiracy theories based on speculation concerning Biblical end-time prophecies.  The author, apparently himself a devout Christian, comes out squarely against these theories, feeling they create much fear and hopelessness among believers and are therefore contrary to the teachings of Christ, if not his apostles.  As for the more generally known conspiracy theories such as the JFK assassination cover-up, the McVeigh as fall guy for a larger plot, the massacre at Waco, he says very little to put the issue to rest except to list these theories along with a group of other theories which he thinks very little of and therefore dismisses.  He does uncover a few facts I was unfamiliar with.  For example, Janet Reno was moved to okay the Waco attack out of an extreme concern for the children allegedly abused by Koresh.  Why it was better for them to be dead is not part of his treatise.  Altogether, the book was disappointing to me because I expected a worthy rebuttal of theories which have been bothering us for so long.  Instead, I learned a few interesting tidbits about how various Christian groups or sects have interpreted the apocalyptic messages of the Bible 
 I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers.  But this story is just way too slow.  Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again.  I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner.  About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel.  
 With five kids under the age of 9 and four Leapsters in the house, there is rarely a time when someone isn't playing one (if not all!) of them. We have about 10 of the cartridges, and this was the most disappointing (followed closely by Spiderman). There simply isn't enough for them to do with it. The beauty of the Leapster is the ability to interact with the games, and learn while they do it. Watching a video on a 2 inch screen just doesn't cut it. 
 If you got Elvis Presley and Dodie Marshall and put them in the same film you will have Easy Come Easy Go, an Elvis Presley that people who like boats or sailing or both will love. But anybody that hates boats or sailing and is an Elvis Presley fan will be un-happy. And Elvis' leading lady in this film is Dodie Marshall which I guess is a re-make of a film with the same name came out in 1947. And this is one of final films that Elvis sings the same song with somebody else, and the song is Yoga Is As Yoga Goes. He sings that with Elsa Lanchester who plays a not very nice yoga teacher. If you are an Elvis Presley fan, then buy or rent Jailhouse Rock on video or dvd 
 Before this misguided book was published, DDT was successfully reducing malaria deaths across the globe.  After it, and the subsequent ban on DDT, millions of people have suffered and died needlessly.  For example, in Sri Lanka in 1948, there were 2.8 million malaria cases and 7,300 malaria deaths. With widespread DDT use, malaria cases fell to 17 and no deaths in 1963. After DDT use was discontinued, Sri Lankan malaria cases rose to 2.5 million in the years 1968 and 1969, and the disease remains a killer in Sri Lanka today.  Carson' science is dodgy, her conclusions false and her prescriptions plain wrong.  Do not buy this boo 
 My main qualm with "Innocence" is that I thought I was going to be reading vampire fiction. It is not. I wouldn't even go so far as to say the writing contains good 'allegorical vampirism.' This isn't the author's fault but more so with the online library directories and book selling sites that push this book as vampire fiction (I don't think Amazon categorized it as this). The plot of the book is boring and unable to relate to. It's about a new girl at high school who lost her mom, classmates commiting suicide, becoming a woman, and the girl's dad's fiance is evil. The other problem I have with this book is the shoddy writing. For example, at the end of chapter 21, Mendelsohn describes the main character Beckett's thoughts on her boyfriend: "We lingered in this trippy, underwater paradise like a couple of dolphins at Sea World. I think, Am I crazy? Am I sane? What's real? What's fake? But the questions rise in bubbles from my head and drift away. I don't want to know the answers." Writing from the perspective of a depressed high school girl doesn't mean your entire book should sound like the contrived attempts at writing fiction from a 10th grade creative writing class. If you want beautiful, delusional fiction, read Hunter S. Thompson's "Fear and Loathing." If you want good vampire fiction, stick to Anne Rice. I'm just thankful I checked this out from a library and didn't pay to read it 
 Short choppy sentences with one page in color and the next in black and white left me wishing this book was done differently.  Loving nature, I wanted to really enjoy this story, but I didn't.  There were facts thrown in haphazardly with thoughts and there was absolutely no reason for the black and white harsh transition every other page into color.  I just didn't get the concept the illustrator was trying to portray.  I did like that the pages were made out of paper that felt like it was recycled just for this tree story.  And the introduction of, "Trees are very nice. They fill up the sky." was a nice way to start this book, and the ending of, "They wish they had one so they go home and plant a tree too." leaves you with a positive activity, but the rest of it was drab for me 
 Unless I want to live inside a bubble it seems that this book is telling me EVERYTHING causes IBS-C. I tried all the ideas, the probiotics and herbs. Changed my diet. Everything the book suggested and my condition in two months went from bad to worse. I am diagnosed with type A IBS-C after many test there is no mistaking my condition for anything else. This book is a joke unless you want to spend your hard earned money on herbs and potions and diets that will land you in a hospital with malnutrion. I think this book needs to be taken lightly and read between the lines and if you are severe IBS C or B case RUN RUN FAST DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! 
 When this book arrived, it had obviously been handled very poorly during the packaging process. There were smudges and rips all over the cover, detracting from the book's appeal as a coffee table book. I returned it to a local Borders and requested they order a replacement, but I'm still waiting for the new book to come in. This has been very frustratin 
 I read this book only because it was lent to me by an unfortunate person who was lumbered with it for Mothers Day. It was the only BTB book I've read since "Woman of Substance" and I fine it hard to believe that it was written by the same writer! The dialogue was unbelievably twee and some of it was out of a Victorian novel---the heroine calls her brother --Brother mine!!!!!Oh brother! I finished it because it was so bad that it was funny 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox! I will Update again - Feb. 10,200 
 Memorex changed the cases in this package, yet failed to reflect this on the packaging.  I purchased them at a local Office Depot.  It's the one with the patented hub that's supposed to protect your DVDs center.  Anyway, the two packages I got are no difference in comparison to regular cases I've gotten with sets I've bought.  I felt ripped off and will be returning these to the store for a refund 
 For all the talk Stossel makes about how he exposed all that he claims to hate, he grants himself a nice big fat deal of a job at ABC. The only reason Stossel switched from liberal to libertarian was his opportunistic behavior. For all that he claimed to expose, it was the ordinary folks doing it for him while he stole the credit. Stossel would be better off exposing fundamentalists in the Arab world if he cared to prove himself worth anything other than a pile of dirt talking dirt 
 This book is all fluff and very little real information.  The language is cloying and takes away from any recipe that I would consider making.  Rachel shoud stick to TV where it's fun to watch her, and forget books unless she's writing kiddie books.  I am an accomplished cook and was hoping to find some easy, quick recipes.  Instead, I was annoyed by all the Cute Stuff 
 This book, while providing very good information on nutrition recommendations during pregnancy, falls short on the recipes. I tried several of the recipes, and each one left out pertinent information. I would also say that I have read the same nutrition information in other pregnancy books, so it is not really worth buying, in my opinion 
 This movie depicts the said goings on of rich kids with too much time on their hand. Once again Larry Clark delivers a film which is nothing more than for him to see a bunch of teen kids naked. It's Kids but with a murder plo 
 I am interested every thing about Roof Garden for  example about soil  ,irregation,countaner,new system,all phd teses program,etc  
 This book was a huge dissapointment for me.  I am a stay at home Christian mother of 3.  It is the typical Christian "fluff" that so many publishers and authors are putting out.  I might as well have picked up an arts and crafts holiday book.  I am suprised that focus on the family affiliated themselves with this book 
 Good DVD, but I did not feel it is worth the selling price.  The DVD primarily concentrates on 12 basic striking movements starting from the seated position.  There is a bonus feature from one of his seminars.  This feature was helpful because he gives additional tips on the movements and points out common mistakes.  I would have preferred sections of his live seminar edited into the main instructional section.  One has to refer to both the seminar and the instructional section to gather all the information provided in the DVD. 
 I bought this book based on the blurbs, and the fact that I enjoy an occasional Steven Covey - type read.  This sure wasn't one of them.  I started the book once and put it down after reaching the third point, thinking that maybe this wasn't simplistic pap written in an incredibly juvenile fashion, but that maybe for whatever reason my head wasn't into it.  I took it on a recent vacation, thinking that with my mind unfettered, etc., perhaps I might be more open to what the book had to say.  Wrong.  This is a terribly written book, with a hokey, herky-jerky style by an author in need of some creative writing classes, spouting the most basic of tenants as if they are something new.  For Pete's sake, basically this fellow took Zig Ziglar and put in a clever twist of the 'Time Bandits' style confrontations with famous characters. I noted with amusement that all of the characters basically had the same sort of dialogue. When Anne Frank has the same speech patterns as Solomon and Harry Truman, I know I'm reading a really bad book.  Comparing this to Og Mandino is an insult to Og.   This book is to motivational literature what 'Bridges of Madison County' was to fiction 
 This book sat on my bookshelf for a couple of years, and I finally decided to get to it last week. I should have left it where it was. Although it gives you a decent overview of Chess and its artists, it reads like a dry listing of every recording session and every song that Chess ever did - most of which are of absolutely zero importance, and which nobody cares about. When it does mention a little tidbit that might be more interesting, it is usually given a sentence, maybe two if you're lucky. Furthermore, the author jumps all over the place for each topic; he goes back and forth between decades at the drop of a hat - and the company wasn't around that long. The writing is extremely sloppy, and uses odd punctuation and structure. I think that this may just be a British style of writing (the author is from London, according to the jacket). Whatever it is, it is really irritating for an American to read. If you've never read anything by a British writer, and you plan to read this book, prepare to be annoyed. The book would have been served better if it had been re-edited for publication in America. Also, I'll mention that the author puts WAY too much emphasis on how Chess did in Britain. I acknowledge that Britain played an important part in the revitalization of blues music in the 1960's, but really, does anybody care how The Dells sold in the UK? In general, by the writing and the content, it seems that the book was written by a British fan, one who likes the music, but doesn't have much of a clue of where it came from or why 
 today i have not received this book yet.could you inform me when this book would be delivered, please 
 I enjoyed this author's other "Outsmarting" book better, the one NOT about menopause.  This book comes across as whiney at times with a "woe-is-me" approach to midlife, despite her efforts to appear positive.  She condones eating things like French fries, potato chips, full-fat products, daily chocolate and has a minimum-necessary approach to fitness.  She clearly isn't a fitness fanatic.  She even mentions that larger women can have a commanding presence and lists Aretha Franklin as an example!  Hello, that woman epitomizes over-indulgence.  Also, if you are very active, you will have to get more food into you than she says.  I tried to only eat the smallest meals only when I was hungry, and probably because I am fit and exercise regularly, I needed quite a few more calories than she suggested.  I suggest women look to a life full of activity as an antidote to depression and aging, and I would not suggest, as the author does, that the fat we need in our diet come from junk foods like potato chips.  There are so many more ways to get fat into your diet that don't involve saturated fats.  Avoiding bad foods does not qualify as a "diet."  It's good sense 
 I bought one of these and was quite disappointed.  I have two small kids who get fingerprints on all of there DVDs.  I sprayed one, dropped it in the machine, watched it spin around and then...  When I pulled the disc out, there were still fingerprints all over it.  Using my shirt, I gently wiped on one and it came right off.  How can the cleaning pad NOT work, but my shirt work just fine?  I took it back to the store 
 The Civ name has been tarnished.  Analogously, one thing I have been learning is that just because Sid Meier's name is on a product, it doesn't mean the product is good.  In the case of CivCity: Rome, unfortunately, it doesn't just come in at "modestly good" - it comes in at "dismally poor."  I've tried hard not to let this influence my beliefs about Civilization in general, but after Civ4 came out, I am starting to believe that Firaxis Games and Sid Meier are on their way out.  And now this...  I regret to inform that the great Civ titles were made a long time ago.  The offerings of today have a simple pattern: the production was rushed and the title came out with major bugs; the games add unnecessary features designed to justify the overall cost; and the consumers are often abused with ridiculous expansion packs containing features that should OBVIOUSLY have been included in the original release - they take advantage of our love for the franchise.  This pattern is so evident that the whole Sid Meier and Civ franchise is degenerating.  It almost seems, especially with the release of CivCity: Rome, that we are once again expected to simply drop cash for new products based on our love for the old.  But the developers are not living up to our expectations for producing great games!  Stay away from CivCity: Rome.  Besides the obvious blunders associated with all the bugs, you will see that even the best patch cannot make the graphics look good, the narration and sound effects better, or the interface to work properly.  The game is a dismal failure, and I am sorry to report that.  It seems like Firefly Studios had an idea and got the license from Firaxis, but they just cheesed it.  Watching what Maxis (The Sims and SimCity franchises) and Firaxis (Civilization franchise) are doing to their most loyal fans is like watching your dad get drunk 
 Even when this book was published, the information it gave was terribly out of date on the subject of interstitial cystitis. Don't get any info on the subject from this textbook 
 I found the same problem that other users of this product experienced.  Particularly the issue of the shutter release being at the bottom of the camera when composing a portrait oriented shot.  I found a stroboframe flash bracket that rotates the camera counter clockwise within the flash bracket instead of flipping the flash.  This leaves the shutter release at the top of the camera and also alleviated the other problem of speed light hot shoe breakage from repeated "flipping" of the flash that some other users have reported.  The item is manufactured by Stroboframe and can be found at an ebay store called "Gadget Infinity" under the listing title of "Flash Bracket with 90 degrees Camera Rotate feature".  Buy it now price is $29.99.  I just bought one and it arrived yesterday and I could not be happier.  Pass the word of this ingenious new product that will solve the issues that have plagued photographers for the past several years 
 Here are some subtle questions in "Catcher in the Rye" which are not mentioned in Cliffs Notes:  --Holden flunks oral expression class because he couldn't refrain from digressing.  Could that have to with his tendency to digress in this novel?  --Holden repeatedly wonders where the ducks go when the pond freezes over.  Could this be because he wonders where students go when they flunk out of school?  --Two boys ask Holden for directions to the mummy exhibit.  Could this have to do with the death motif?  --According to one reviewer, Holden watches Phoebe going around on the merry-go-round because he wants to keep her frozen in childhood.  --On page 141, Holden expresses willingness not to kill but to be killed.  On page 188, a teacher delivers a quote which favors living for a great cause over dying for a great cause.  How do these two connect?  --Holden repeatedly lies about his age and repeatedly orders alcohol.  What is he trying to accomplish?  --Holden criticizes almost everyone but his sister.  What would a Transactional Analyst say about his "I'm OK, you're not OK" stance?  --Upon virtually every mishap, Holden makes a generalization.  How would this be interepreted in light of "Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy" by David D. Burns?  Under each chapter heading, there is a Summary heading and a Commentary heading.  Most of what Kaplan calls Commentary is really more summary.  I had a professor who gave C+'s to students who can only deliver plot summaries.  My professor might give Kaplan a C+ 
 You narcs complain the world is against you, you won't shower, cut your hair or lose the clothes.  The truth is that a newly-sober alcoholic named William Griffith Wilson -- a down-on-his-luck former Wall Street hustler who put on airs of having once been a prosperous stock broker -- just sat down, in December of 1938, and wrote up twelve commandments for the new religious group that he and fellow alcoholic Doctor Robert Smith had started. Those commandments were simply a repackaged version of the practices of a cult religion that was popular at that time, something called "The Oxford Group", or "The Oxford Group Movement", and later, "Moral Re-Armament" -- a religious cult that was created by a deceitful fascist renegade Lutheran minister named Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman -- a nut-case who actually praised Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler.   Bill Wilson described the writing of the Twelve Steps this way:   Well, we finally got to the point where we really had to say what this book was all about and how this deal works. As I told you this had been a six-step program then.   The idea came to me, well, we need a definite statement of concrete principles that these drunks can't wiggle out of. There can't be any wiggling out of this deal at all and this six-step program had two big gaps which people wiggled out of.   Notice how Bill Wilson considered his fellow alcoholics to be a bunch of cheaters who will "wiggle out of this deal" if they can get away with it -- which Bill won't allow.   And note how Bill Wilson made himself the leader who was entitled to dictate the concrete terms of other people's recovery programs.  Also notice how Bill Wilson considered 'spiritual development' to be a business deal, with a contract that you can't wiggle out of, something like selling your soul in trade for sobriety.   Nowhere in the Twelve Steps does it say that you should quit drinking, or help anyone else to quit drinking, either. Nowhere do the words "sobriety", "recovery", "abstinence", "health", "happiness", "joy", "love", or "love", appear in the Twelve Steps. The word "alcohol" was only mentioned once, where it was patched into the first step as a substitute for the word "sin" -- Bill Wilson wrote,  "we are powerless over alcohol and our lives have become unmanageable",  instead of the Oxford Group slogan,  "we are powerless over sin and have been defeated by it".  And then the phrase "especially alcoholics" was patched into the 12th step as a suggested target for further recruiting efforts:  "...we tried to carry this message to others, especially alcoholics"...  (But regular non-alcoholic people were still fair game for recruiting into Bill's "spiritual fellowship"...)   The Twelve Steps are not a formula for curing or treating alcoholism, and they never were.  The Twelve Steps are not "spiritual principles" and they never were.  The Twelve Steps are cult practices that work to convert people into confirmed true believers in a proselytizing cult religion, just like Frank Buchman's so-called "spiritual principles" did.   1. The Twelve Steps do not work as a program of recovery from drug or alcohol problems.  The A.A. failure rate ranges from 95% to 100%. Sometimes, the A.A. success rate is actually less than zero, which means that A.A. indoctrination is positively harmful to people, and prevents recovery. Some tests have shown that even receiving no treatment at all for alcoholism is much better than receiving A.A. treatment:  One of the most enthusiastic boosters of Alcoholics Anonymous, Professor George Vaillant of Harvard University, who is also a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (AAWS), showed by his own 8 years of testing of A.A. that A.A. was worse than useless -- that it didn't help the alcoholics any more than no treatment at all, and it had the highest death rate of any treatment program tested -- a death rate that Professor Vaillant himself described as "appalling". While trying to prove that A.A. treatment works, Professor Vaillant actually proved that A.A. kills. After 8 years of A.A. treatment, the score with Dr. Vaillant's first 100 alcoholic patients was: 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.  (Nevertheless, Vaillant is still a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous, and he still wants to send all alcoholics to A.A. anyway, to "get an attitude change by confessing their sins to a high-status healer." That is cult religion, not a treatment program for alcoholism.)  The A.A. dropout rate is terrible. Most people who come to A.A. looking for help in quitting drinking are appalled by the narrow-minded atmosphere of fundamentalist religion and faith-healing. The A.A. meeting room has a revolving door. The therapists, judges, and parole officers (many of whom are themselves hidden members of A.A. or N.A.) continually send new people to A.A., but those newcomers vote with their feet once they see what A.A. really is. Even A.A.'s own triennial surveys, conducted by the A.A. headquarters (the GSO), say that:  81% of the newcomers are gone within 30 days,  90% are gone in 3 months, and  95% are gone at the end of a year.  That automatically gives A.A. a failure rate of at least 95%. But the GSO does not count all of those people who only attend a few meetings before quitting -- they don't qualify as "members". (That amounts to "cherry-picking".) If we included them, then the numbers would be much worse.   First there is the propaganda technique of "everybody's doing it": "AA or a similar Twelve-Step program is an integral part of almost all successful recoveries".  That is a complete falsehood. The vast majority of the successful people recover without A.A. or any "support group". It's what "everybody" is doing.  Then they use the propaganda techniques of use of the passive voice and vague suggestions: "It is widely believed that not including a Twelve-Step program in a treatment plan can put a recovering addict on the road to relapse."  It is widely believed by whom? And what do those unnamed people know? What are their qualifications? Are they doctors? Medical school professors? Or salesmen for a 12-Step treatment center? Why should we care what some unnamed invisible fools allegedly believe, anyway?  The authors also use the propaganda technique of fear-mongering: you will be "on the road to relapse" -- you will probably die -- unless you practice Bill Wilson's Twelve Step cult religion.  And then the fluff-headed Pollyanna attitude is outrageous: Just going to the wonderful A.A. meetings is supposedly all that is needed to fix some alcoholics.  But since A.A. has a zero-percent success rate above and beyond the normal rate of spontaneous remission, that cannot possibly be tru 
 This book is quite a simple (and sometimes unusefull) introduction to design/build Speaker System. Design principles are old and it does not cover new trends such as implementation of spice models and simulation. Maybe only source code (written in BASIC for DOS!) can be interesting for an absolute beginner, ... eventhough it's cheap, save your money 
 This is Microsoft's most stable OS yet, but ridiculously over- priced.  I'll admit, I'm no fan of Microsoft, but I've very few problems with my desktop once I upgraded from Windows me 
 The end of this book was terrible. The end of a series should be catacalismic for someone, but in this book everyone, even the bad guys, get what they want. I would not recommend this book to anyone 
  I purchased this book to read on a scuba diving trip in eastern Indonesia over Christmas and was very disappointed (I should have read the online reviews before I did).  While the subject matter is fascinating, and a large part of the narrative engaging, much too much time is spent by the author digressing into his often unrelated personal experiences during his travels around the world, name dropping those in his profession, inserting strained literary references and generally telling the reader endless amounts of useless information.  Admittedly, in Chapter 1 the Author tells the readers that "where my own experiences with people or places will serve to bring the process of investigation alive then I shall make diversions, the better to illuminate the way forward."  This sounds great in theory and a valid alternative to dry, impersonal prose.  The problem is that these many, many diversions provide no illumination at all on the subject matter (or the way forward), and they make much of the book read like a bad travelogue, with the author telling us he's in London or Oman or China or somewhere else and how fascinating or wonderful his trip is, such as a conference in Wales where we are told during a dinner he "sat next to a jolly professor of Celtic languages who explained the bardic tradition to me."  How does this possibly illuminate anything remotely related to natural history?  A few such diversions are tolerable or even folksy, but unfortunately they are never ending in this book.  In addition, the work suffers from an appalling lack of tables, maps, charts, diagrams and similar visual information that would help the reader better understand the subject matter.  Instead, the book contains pictures of such things as (and I'm not making this up) a row of slot machines in a Las Vegas casino and the tablecloth used during teatime by Lady Smith Woodward.  If you want a good book on the natural history of the Earth, keep shopping. 
 	Sally Denton's Faith and Betrayal is a disappointing book. It promised all the elements of an exceptionally dramatic (and true) story: love and loss, wealth and poverty, dedication and disillusionment, an epic journey, a peculiar religion, polygamy, theocracy, a massacre, and perhaps betrayal. But Denton's account is so replete with inaccuracies and confusion of facts that it destroys all credibility. Listing her errors would take nearly as many pages as the book itself. In addition she failed to use the richest repository of primary sources of Mormon history-the LDS Church Historical Department Archives. Presumably this is because she assumed she would not be welcome, she believed the records there had been selectively censored, or she thought they would have little relevance.  	As a non-Mormon historian working on the stories of disillusioned converts in the same period of the mid-nineteenth century, I can assure her that for the past decade I have never been refused generous help in the Church Archives and have found the records there amazingly rich, especially the correspondence of Brigham Young and the diaries of contemporaries of those who left the church.  	Denton makes Jean Rio's piano a pivotal issue, which she says was brought to Utah in 1851, though Jean Rio never mentions it in her trip diary nor does the captain of the company she traveled with in his (which is in the Church Archives). Denton fails to give a source for her account of it. It is quite possible Jean Rio ordered the piano later after her arrival in Salt Lake and had it shipped from the East. As for the tar-covered crate (p. 165), if that is in a museum in California, could not have Denton done the research to find where it is?  	Was Jean Rio's piano taken by the church leaders through "consecration"-a rule of stewardship (pp. xvii, 129)? Did Denton bother to inquire in the Church Archives what the consecration records show? Not all records survived, but many did. It is unlikely the church purged them of information about the piano. Likewise, did Denton ever ask the staff at the Museum of Church History and Art about the provenance of the piano? One Jean Rio descendent believes it was gifted to the museum by a Mormon descendant. Here again Denton confuses her facts: She states (p. 130) that the piano is in the "Church Temple Museum"; there is no such institution.  	Denton claims the piano ended up in the "Amelia Palace, the home of Young's favorite wife, a beautiful Englishwoman named Ann Eliza Webb Dee Young Denning..." (p. 129). Here Denton has all too typically confused Young's so-called "favorite" wife Harriet Amelia Folsom with a later wife, Ann Eliza. Neither were English. The Gardo House, the so-called "Amelia's Palace," was not finished until after Brigham Young's death; Amelia lived in it a short period to establish her claim in Young's will, while Ann Eliza never lived there.  	Denton quotes from one of my papers (pp. 153-54), and although the quote is correct, she misinterprets my account, stating "The flow of Mormon defectors had become the largest emigration to that point, far surpassing even the California gold rush." No records can support that idea. Likewise, she claims that "U.S. Army escorts oversaw a burgeoning traffic of disaffected Mormons fleeing Zion." There was only one such escort from Salt Lake of approximately forty families.  	Although a beautifully produced little book, publisher Alfred A. Knopf should be embarrassed at having accepted and published such a consistently unreliable "history." I'm sorry to advise potential readers not to waste their money 
 First of all I am a big fan of this band.  However, this CD left me greatly disappointed.  It is not immediate or catchy except for a few songs - that unfortunately, after a few listens, emerge as false hope - for they also leave a lot to be desired.  Even after repeated listens on my part in an effort to give it a chance to grow on me, it never did.  Maybe for comparison purposes you could say this album is of a similar vein to the self-titled 1992 effort King's X ... but not even in the ballpark.  Try Gretchen, Out of the Silent Planet, Dogman, or King's X for their best.  I even liked Bulbous and Manic Moonlight, but this one is summed up in one word ... DUL 
 Bill, when will you just die?  if you read this feel free to email me evan.fett@gmail.co 
 I really thought the author had a terrific idea in writing a send up of our modern world plotted around a sensational killing. All the elements were there, the media, hollywood, gays, etc. However, he missed the opportunity to paint the characters and the plot in broad satirical brush strokes. Often you could almost take these characters seriously. The dialogue, which is probably typical for Dunne, is too clever by half. This book certainly did not make me want to read any more of his writings 
 I expected this book to be an account of the author's being born again as a Christian.  Unfortunately the book contains very little material on this subject.  Rather it is a pedestrian account of a rather boring boyhood and adolescence.  His only slightly veiled anti-Semitic remarks contribute to a very uncomplimentary self-portrait 
 This is the most dumbest story I've ever seen.  It does not make sense and waste of my time to watch it. 
 I hate this CD. I have most of the other Chieftan CD's, and their collaboration with other artists has always worked in the past. This collection runs the gamut from mediocre to ludicrous. To paraphrase a line from Spinal Tap:"There's a fine line between clever and stupid." This one's over the line.  "Tears of Stone" is my current fave 
 It is well known that the Chomskyans don't listen to criticism, however well taken.  The result is the 1995 Chomsky essays, in which relatively well known and primitive problems of English syntax are clothed in practically unreadable technical language, to lead to highly artificial pretentious solutions which are as counterintuitive as you please. Not as if simpler solutions weren't possible.  In the meanwhile, the entire ivory tower of MIT linguistics has become an impregnable fortress of sectarians who will only deal with the problem of the most perfect formal presentations of well known linguistic problems in their own narrow theoretical framework, regardless of new research in the facts of language, as discovered daily by the language statisticians and the sociolinguists for example.   One cannot enter the fortress because they have made it inaccessible. But it is not uncomfortable to have the fortress in one's back, because nobody will come out, either, to meet criticism or to face new empirical evidence about language 
 I have read several of Hiaasen's books and loved them.  They were very funny.  This one is not.  It is an endless description of naked strippers.  I found the main character, Erin, to be very unappealing.  She is just so stupid.  Her problems are all of her own creation.  And she is not funny.  I think you have to be a man to like this book.  I, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring.  I kept waiting for it to get funny.  It never did 
 the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book.  the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were.  this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. dont waste your time reading it 
 I din't love these at all.  The flavor combinations struck me as off, there was no improvement in the pistachio taste by adding harissa. Also the texture was unpleasant, somewhat soggy.  I like the healthy aspect, but if you aren't enjoying the experience why eat at all 
 Into The Woods is one of my Sondheim favorites.  Having seen the PBS presentation of this, I am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this DVD is edited.  Rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction, this DVD uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close-ups.  This especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play; the staging.  By forcing the viewer's perspective, this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath.  I am hoping that somebody releases a version that does not presume to edit out the director's vision 
 Cool idea BUT, this isn't really worth it.  I bought it for myself but would never use it.  On a positive note my 14 yr old liked it.  I wouldn't recommend it for an adult.  
 This product does not come with a screen cover.  Sure, it doesn't say it has one in the description, but what's the point of having an iPod case if it doesn't protect the screen 
 This product was nothing like how I expected it to be. The quality is terrible, do not waste your money on this item  
 Mens, wat zingt deze sufgeneukte parkiet vals. Negeren!  Probeer eens echte muziek 
 Layla is one of the most overrated songs of all time. Cream is one of the most boring bands in history. Why not do yourself a favour and buy enjoyable bands like Dire Straits, and Metallica who rock.  PS.This Clapton compilation has no good songs so please don't buy it at all 
 This disc was simply a waste of my time...very mediocre songs, heavy emphasis on sex instead of talent...Corey's voice is below average....I get the feeling that Corey Clark is IMITATING a good singer with a VIABLE career, and not doing it very well....clearly 'fake it till you make it' isn't working here.  The songs all sound the same, I kept waiting for something to get me grooving, but it just didn't happen.    I think his ego is much larger than his actual musical potential...he either needs voice lessons, a little humility, and some professional grooming (and I don't mean clothing).   
 This may be a bit of spoiler but I was completly dissappointed in the end of this book/trilogy.  I could not understand how she was going to wrap up so many story lines in last few pages of the book and then I learned.  I felt I was reading the end of a story witten by a parent trying to rush their children to bed.  After three books I had invested a great deal of time into these characters and story lines.  To wrap them up so hasty, with such outragouse coincidence and neatness did not do justice to what otherwise was a very thoughtful series of books.   
 ?The Storm Upon Us ? everything seems new and strange ? nothing seems certain ? masses of people are tangibly deprived of their claims to self-sufficiency ? this revolution is steadily creating the predicate for its own collapse ? the prospect of an economic or political cataclysm of unknown dimension ? .? These and similar claims are found on just the first two pages of the book. To be fair, Mr. Greider also references the ?great fortunes? thrown off by globalization and the fact that millions escape poverty, but right from the start you get the feeling that he is working backwards from his conclusions and choosing his rhetoric and his examples to sell his point of view. It?s almost as if Mr. Greider is suggesting that, now that the West has gone through the very sort of radical transformation he describes with shock and dismay, the rest of humanity should just stay where they are at while we in the industrialized world figure out if and how they should reach for the security and the lifestyle that we take for granted. If you are looking to validate an anti-globalization bias you already hold then this may be the book for you, but I think it?s fair to say that most readers would like to benefit from Mr. Greider?s considerable experience and expertise without having to interpret his selective or overly cynical presentation. In a nutshell, my problem with the book is not that it argues against globalization and is wrong, but that it is as committed to persuasion as it is to education. I chose not to finish the book and will look for a more neutral resource 
 Usually Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is my 3 year-old daughter's FAVORITE show, but NOT this episode. This episode is extremely frightening for her to watch, because of Pete's malicious plan and the scary giant. I'm not sure why the folks at Disney thought this was a good plot premise for a show aimed at pre-schoolers? They had a great opportunity to do a cute Spring-themed show here and all they could come up with is this? The other episode on the disc (Donald's Hiccups) is amusing and she'll ask for that repeatedly. I'd say this DVD is for older Mickey fans (5 yrs +). For the younger fans, wait for the hiccup episode to show on Playhouse Disney and watch it there...save your money. 
 I realize what this movie was trying to do. It was trying to be a James Bond kind of film for the X or Extreme generation that is into adrenaline pumping sports that usually cause them pain from trauma to the testicle region or have highlights that make you go, "holy cow! That had to hurt!" over and over. But the thing that they screwed up was making the extreme stuff look to unrealistic and stupid. I liked Vin Diesels character of Xander Cage and I think he has a distinct cool look, charisma and voice that gets him over. His love interest who I will refer to as 'heroin chic' because of her big dark circles under her eyes is kind of hot but also kind of looks like she might need some methadone and a few months in a detox. I also liked the style and wardrobe that was used when they were in Russian including Xanders big furry coat and the villians apparel. And to the heels or villian? I liked them all. They were all big hairy eastern European badasses and I thought XXX was a interesting contrast to them.   But I must say, this movie pretty much sucked. I have watched it since the first time and like it a bit more than the first time because I am seeing it now for what it really is which is just action shlock. It isn't meant to be taken serious and if you watch it just sit back, make fun of the stupid stuff and enjoy the good and bad. And check out racoon eyes at the end in her bikini and her large tattoo around the nether regions. Still can't say if I am attracted to her or not. Its possible that I just want to give her a hot bowl of soup and a couple of sliced cucumbers to put on those dark circles under her eyes. 
 THIS IS A GOOD CD, AS ELLIS IS ALWAYS GOOD.BUT TO GET THE REAL STORY, YOU MUST CHECK OUT 12'S IT. THE MUSIC ON 12'S IT WAS RECORDED BY A TRUE BAND THAT HAD BEEN PLAYING TOGETHER FOR SIX YEARS, AND IT SHOWS 
 It was difficult to stay "tuned-in" to this book.  A few good ideas, but nothing new or different.  It is not a book that I would recommend, however, I might try to listen again -- just to see if I missed the point.  I certainly would NOT give this book as a gift 
 "In democracies, the...arbitrary denial of opportunities is experienced as most painful.  The fact that violence tends to get acted out among family members, acquaintances and neighbors rather than against the rich and powerful does not challenge this argument.  Rather, it suggests that people close at hand are simply "convenient targets" for pent-up anger".  Get the point?  "...arbitrary denial of opportunities"?  If you've got eyes to see it, you can find it anywhere.  This book constitutes yet another liberal's whinning about the same old crap.  I know, I know, capitalism's responsible for everything.  People murder because of income gaps...and on, and on 
 John Dean is older version of Joe Wilson.  Media hacks who will do or say anything if it will get them invited to the next Washington Post cocktail party.  It is just so hard to take this guy seriously.  He is not a serious thinker, his book is laced with presumptions and ethics projections to the point that it sounds like a conservative wrote it trying to make fun of a liberal 
 Dear Oh Dear... Another paganistic and beastly concoction disguised as spiritual awakening. Obviously influenced by the likes of A A Bailey, H P Blavatsky, Aleister Crowley and other Beastly doers of deception. Notice the 666 slightly camouflaged but still blatantly obvious on the front cover? I urge you to read this but to be analytical and on your guard as many of the buzzwords and phrases have alternative meanings. Good people DO NOT be fooled by this ungodly attempt at corrupting the hearts and minds of vulnerable people. May the true God (not some spirit of the earth or a LSD-trip) bless you all 
 After reading this book, I can now see why Washington State's OSPI is in such a terrible state.  Could someone please set Washington's educational system free from its New Age Mentality?  
 This gun broke in the first few used.   When I called for service, they inisted on waiting for the tech, and then the return was going to cost almost what the gun  cost.  Overall...  this was a writeoff 
 a la Conan O'Brien (in the year two thou-sand)  I used this book. Read all the books in the class, a ton of poetry analyzed, what did it get me? A 3. Didn't even get credit at my U for it.  This book (7 edition) is worthless. Just make sure the morning anouncements aren't blaring during exam time, like they were when I took it, and you should get &#62; 3.  Also, get sleep the night b4, and stay really sharp during the reading of the passages for the multiple choice. If you can't understand the passage, move on to the next one fast and come back to the one you skipped after you've built some confidence with the others.  good luc 
 The author's barely concealed condescention towards her Provencal neighbors is annoying enough, but her lack of any charm or distinction relaying her experiences is really a bore.  Read Peter Mayle instead --or ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER,and save your money.  You wouldn't want to live next door to this writer, in Provence or in Bel Air California -- her other home.  Not exactly your average tourist!  And oh my,the recipes!  At the end of each chapter is a recipe of food vaguely mentioned in the text.  Tasteless, trite recipes bound to fail since they lack any semblance of detail, even, sometimes, the baking temperature.  Obviously the lady was trying to cover all bases.  Too bad she struck out on all of them 
 Thank God. I checked this book out at the library. It would have been a waste of money to buy it. I found it to be boring so I pressed on reading up to chapter 15 but it didn't get any better so the book went back unfinished. I think the controversy around this book was mainly for publicity to get people to buy it. It's so sad that most were disappointed 
 Bad plot, bad acting, bad filming.  The surprise ending was a surprise because I had nearly terminated this boring, stupid film long before.  The actress playing the little girl was especially poor 
 Their music is amazing as always.  The video? Are you joking? It is completely unnecessary. I'm glad I had never gone to any of their shows 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 Don't waste your money on this book unless you already have, and want to use, FrontPage Express - a program that I could not find anywhere to download. Note that the date the book was published is 1999, which makes it 6 or 7 years old - exceedingly old in cyber terms!  I don't know why they are ordering more to sell.  No one appears to have anything to say about the book since 2000.  Get something newer 
 The whining drunk shows his true colors.  Should have been off the air at least 10 years before they finally showed him the door.  What a low-life ... if you're broke, it's your fault.  And, if you lost the Masters vs. Arnie, it's because you didn't play well enough to win 
  This particular Sudoku handheld was not as expected. It has only basic functions and the person I purchased for said it is easier just to do Sudoku on line or in the newspaper or in a puzzle book. Really inconvenient functions. May be good for young children, but not adults 
 James Glassman should apologize for his stupidity, his arrogance, and this book, which lured in a whole lot of amateur investors just as the stock market was about to go bust.  
 Ah Nickelback, they're back again, and they've lowered the standard once more (if that was possible). The gem on this album has to be the tune "Rockstar." Chad Kroeger singing about being a rockstar is like Mother Theresa bragging about her criminal record 
 Clive Cussler made his reputation writing books with plots that are barely believable using characters that are totally unbelievable saving the world over and over again from his perch in an unknown but extremely powerful U.S. government agency. After many successful books, Clive perfected the formula and is now sharing it with Paul Kemprecos who co-writes an analogous series which uses the same agency, plots, and characters. Oh, this series does change some things, the main character is Kurt not Dirk and his sidekick is Mexican and not Italian. Also, there is a second pack of characters (Paul and Gamay Trout) who allow the plot to develop through a second set of eyes.  None of which takes away from the formulaic tone of this series and this book in particular. In typical fashion, the first chapter is a historical look that "sets the stage." In this case it is an aerial combat over the Alps in 1914 between an industrialist and six (6!!) combat pilots. Needless to say, the industrialist holds his own and manages to down four of his foes before he himself is shot down and killed. The next chapter comes to the present time and takes off a second thread - this time it is a "survivor"-type of reality show which is interrupted by an attack of some mutated beings. The third chapter starts pulling all these disparate threads together and off we go.  Unfortunately, this book is too formulaic. It does not take the reader long to realize who the threat is, nor does it take us long to see the connections between the various threads. The only real complication is a completely preposterous connection between the bad guy's attempt to take over the world and an infestation of some new kind of sea weed that tries to take over the oceans.  As is usual in these novels, there are high speed car chases, underwater action, aerial acrobatics (in world war 1 vintage planes no less!), underwater escapades and explosion galore. throughout them all, the hero gets a bit bruised but the thugs all manage to get killed (Even though they are supposedly highly trained special forces types) and the world is rescued by the effort of one man - Kurt Austin. There is a love interest (why a different one in each book? Doesn't he ever get to enjoy some time with his rescued conquest?) who is French, and side visits to Scotland and Massachusetts.  The only unique thing about this book was that it was the first time that I was exposed to the "Premium" format which is a slightly longer/taller book with more space between the lines. The book cover states that this format is "Specially designed for comfortable reading" but I cannot say that it improved things for me that much.  To summarize, as a Clive Cussler fan, I had to read this book to make sure I keep up with the adventures, but this one is not in the top two-thirds of his efforts. I am sure that Kurt Austin will reappear soon and hope that the next one will be more interesting and fun to read 
 I was very disappointed in this book because I felt like the title itself is very misleading. The title of the book is called "FREE MONEY From the Federal Governement for SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS" By  Laurie Blum. The book description clearly states that there are hundreds of  millions of dollars available FREE!  to small business and entrepreneurs,  when in fact the only thing that I found in this book pertaining to small  businesses were LOANS and ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, and the last time I checked  LOANS are not free. This book description needs to be more clear as to what  kinds of grants are available and the title "FREE MONEY" should  not be used when this book is filled with mostly loan options. From reading  the book description I was under the impression that this was a book filled  with nothing but grant information!  I was very disappointed and  unsatisfied with this book. If I'm wrong or misunderstood this book please  fill free to correct me and direct me to the pages where the business  grants are supposed to be located 
 The content is good, but these aren't actually flash cards. It's a bound book with very thin pages and two words to each page. Studying with flashcards is best done by testing one's self with cards, slipping failures back into the deck for near-term review, and setting repeated successes aside. This isn't possible with a book. 
 This book is a boring waste of time.  The author doesn't include her letters, so the inmates' letters are sometimes difficult to follow.  She probably chose to omit her correspondence because she hasn't always been truthful regarding her identity or her motives for writing and receiving the letters.  The author could benefit from an ethics course at her local college.  In the end, the reader has learned no more about these inmates than what is available about them elsewhere in much more interesting and better written books and articles.  Do yourself a favor and waste your time with a less painfully boring endeavor 
 There are few books out there that cover using Flash as traditional animation medium, and even fewer that are any good. The Art of Flash Animation is another book in the "not so good" column.  The fact that this book came from a small publisher like Wordware means you don't get a lot of the frills you'd expect in an animation book. The illustrations are a bit sparse and in black & white. There's no CD of examples or finished files. A lot of the projects he mentions can be found on his website, which I wasn't particularly impressed with; especially the audio on his personal cartoons.  Even though the book spends a lot of time talking about animation and Flash, not a lot of usable information comes out of it. A few tidbits of animation knowledge come out, but still the best advice this book gives is to read The Animator's Survival Kit. I don't need a $23 book to tell me to buy a $20 book.   The Flash instruction is also rather lacking. If you've never touched Flash before in your life, you might learn something. If you already have a working knowledge of the program, you won't learn a thing.   All in all, it's quite a bit of money to spend on such a small amount of learning 
 I hope "Duets: The Final Chapter" is the last thing released by BIG. Puffy/Diddy needs to stop trying to make money off of Biggie's old material and let him rest in peace. "Duets: The Final Chapter" just contains old Biggie material remixed and re-worked into new songs. The only release I want to see of Biggie is to have "Ready to Die" back into print and a 10th anniversary of "Life after death" in 2007 wouldn't bother me too much. Buy Puffy/Diddy needs to stop trying to make new Biggie material by re-working his old material. And acording to Amazon's editorial reviews of tis product, There will be a limited edition CD/DVD which includes never before seen performance footage, celebrity interviews and vintage Biggie videos. That dvd needs it own release. This cd is not good at all. The only decent tracks on this cd are the ones with his other and kids. And That is where I tunes come in handy. I wouldn't be surpised if Bad Boy released their own version of Queen Latifah's "Dana Ownes Album" entitled "The Christopher Wallace Album" 
 I did find the book helpful for some types of wood, however, I also found that some of the discriptions were verbatum to another book that I had.  I am not sure who copied who.  This book did not list all the common names of some of the more available species where it went overboard on some very obscure species.  I also found it lacking in the number of species that it covered.  I have many species in my shop that are not mentioned anywhere and they are readily available commecialy 
 The title of this book made it sound really promising.  But I didn't think the book was convicing - just a lot of platitudes.  The only good nuggets of info: Don't compare yourself to others.  You are just where you are supposed to be.  Don't waste time envying people whom you would not want to be.  It gets better.  The passage of time enhances your life.   
 I wanted to like this book, but I guess I'm not down and depressed enough to relate to it. It was just so much of the same miserable life page after page after page.  Oh wait-- there's good reason: she was never hugged as a child, therefore can and will be a depressed alcoholic loser for her entire life.  I don't mind some "loser-lit" but there has to be an evolution or an awakening or some kind of lightbulb to keep me interested, otherwise I lose sympathy and figure, well, if that's your attitude, you deserve what you get.  I can relate to the "hard times-hard life" theme-- everyone's faced some dark moments-- but I can't feel much empathy when it becomes a choice, a lifestyle, an escape, and just a jerky way of behaving.  Normally I'd give this a higher rating because the "writing" was  more or less technically correct, but I, for one, am getting tired of "I Suck" books that ramble on without a point, without a story, without any real skill in creative storytelling.   I did not find "a character who is endearing because of her flaws."  She was a jerk.  I didn't think they were "some endearingly horrific blunders at work."  She was stupid. I didn't find it "enlivened with refreshingly unsentimental humor." It was pathetic.  There was nothing "charmingly original." Charmingly??? If this is an example of an author who "manages to keep the tone hopeful" - I'd hate to read something really depressing 
 I don't know why I do it to myself anymore.  Goodkind brought a real gem into the world of fantasy novels when he wrote Wizard's First Rule.  Unfortunately, as with most novel series I have read, it was all downhill from there.  The most common complaint in the reviews I have read seems to be that Goodkind's novels have become thinly-veiled philosophy essays, and I concur with that.  I'd also add that the story is predictable, the characters behave foolishly, and (how can I put this in a way that won't spoil the ending?) things just seem to work out a little too conveniently.  After this one, I don't think I'll continue to torture myself with any more of Goodkind's work.  I no longer care what happens to Richard and Kahlan, and as much as I liked them in the first book, that's pretty depressing 
 I usually don't review books I didn't finish reading or movies I didn't finish watching, but this was just way too boring to justify wasting more of my time on, even though I listened to it as an audiobook so I could do other things while "reading". I turned it off after six chapters and I'm not likely to finish it. This is my first Nora Roberts book and if they're all like this I really don't have any clue why she's so popular. I'll try one of her mystery novels before judging her, however.   Stay away from this one. 
 I did not like this book too much because the sugar substitute that she uses sometimes, like rice syrup is very difficult to find. I do not recomend this book 
 Mr. Hicks has done a wonderful job in compling equations, however, he has missed the practical applications in compressed air and vacuum systems.  I initially used his theoritcal position on calculating pressure drop in pipe for compressed air.  His position seems reasonable and logical until you compare the results with practical applications.  Ingresoll-Rand, the air compressor manufacturer, published tables of pressure drop verses pipe sizes, delivery pressures and ACFM.  Futher ASPE has published a data book which leads the engineer into an empirical equation for calculating pressure loss in compressed air piping.  The results with both Ingresoll-Rand and ASPE agree.  Using Mr. Hicks' therotical approach drives the pipe size much larger than needed and therefore the cost of the project.  My suggestion is that Mr. Hicks contact I-R and ASPE to incorporate their empirical approach to sizing pipe for compressed air and vacuum systems 
 While overall I found this book enjoyable enough to read, I must agree with the aforelisted reviewer Mr. Sam King that Reid does not do a good job in getting his facts straight. I too found glaring errors in his history of rock in the late sixties. His writing style is OK, but I think it's irresponsible to do such a lame research job in such a high-profile publication. Most people probably don't know, won't care, or won't notice, but I was pretty appalled 
 Here a book by a liberal Jew who is a renowned Prof. in the US. The book is proudly Zionist, having many passage that make you feel very proud of being a Jew and of our value and achievement. Also poetry, etc. spoke to the heart of my Jewish soul. However Cantor is a liberal who does not believe in our blessed fathers Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, etc. nor in our slavery and suffering in Egypt, etc. Well, then he can't say that we are God's only chosen people, God's elects. Instead of seeing us as a holy race set apart, Cantor has to ground his Zionism in the superiority of the Jewish race, using the fact of the superior Jewish Intelligence. This is clearly liberal Zionism and not orthodox. orst of all, he shows total disrespect to our Holy religion by everywhere using different names for G-D, and I dare not count these innumerable blasphemies. This is not a book for orthodox Jews. Not that I cannot read painful literature - I go through and mark out the antisemitic literature, yet to see a Zionist, proud Jew like Cantor who has in fact lost the essence of the Jewish soul and even defiles our Fathers, our religion and the Name... Sorry but I can only warn my orthodox brothers not to buy this book, it will hurt them, if not defile them 
 I was expected a study guide geared for a university level, not elementary/highschool 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 After waiting so long to see some of these great films in widescreen DVD, it is a major disappointment to see the quality of the transfers in this collection. As another reviewer has noted, Naked Spur is not good and Cheyenne Social Club looks like the entire film was transferred out of focus. Low bit rate to make two features fit on the (two sided) DVD? Who knows. Hard to believe the source material is marred in this way. I bought the collection; Cheyenne and Firecreek are available on their own as a two-disc set that may or may not be better. I've seen Warner features 30 years older that look much better. Shame on you Time Warner 
 I'm sure that this would be a wonderful book for anyone interested in the history of the fantasy genre - including movies and television shows, characters and certain authors.  However, if you are looking for a book that contains information of the fantasy world itself (ie. mythical beasts, worlds, spells, etc...), like I was, this is definately the wrong book for you.  I am a fantasy writer and was looking for information that would help in my writing.  This book, now that I have had a good look at it, will sit on my shelf and collect dust until I can find someone to give or sell it to.  If you are looking for information on movies, this is a book for you... If not, then don't waste your time and money on this book.  It is not worth it 
 After reading other reviews, I expected an erudite, flowing novel which would connect multiple worlds.  What I discovered was a complicated plot that does not make it easy for the reader to understand.  I do believe that if writing is too difficult to comprehend, then is not clear writing, and I wonder if the author really knows if she is presenting a ghost or love story of both.  If it is both, it is confusing to me.  The action is wrapped around two cousins, one successul and the victim of a childhood prank of the other loser adult cousin.  We are transported to a castle near Prague where we imagine the successful cousin will finally have retribution, Egan spins a tale of blood lore based on family pride.  From this narrative, she shifts to a maximum security prison where the characters are similar to the castle folk.  The creative writing teacher, Holly, becomes a main character, who has her own demons and finds a commonaility with a prisoner who is the same, we are to believe, as the loser cousin.  She does prove that escape is impossible, and I wish I could have found some sanctuary if I understood what she really wanted to tell us 
 I bought this as a birthday present for my mom because she used to have the It's A wonderful Life in color on VHS.I recored over this VHS about 5 years ago, and i have felt terrible ever since. AMazon said that this edition was in color, so i decided that this was a perfect gift for my mom. I received the DVD today, and i am so dissapointed that it is not color? Why did they tell us it wasn't 
 Only problem is, that it is only worth 19.00, which is the TRUE list price 
 This is an extremely poor translation of Beowulf for anyone who wants more than just a narrative summary.  Wright has, by his own admission, eliminated most of the poetic language from the original poem.  The poetic, metaphor-like kennings seemed to him puzzles and word games which barred the reader from the real meanings of the narrative.  The appositives used in place of actual names and pronouns he found "long-winded," and the poetic descriptions pretentious.  Wright, apparently believing readers not intelligent enough to understand creative language, has given us a translation of Beowulf in the form of highly simplified prose, with few poetic descriptions or language that will "distract the reader" from the narrative. What remains is a clumsy, awkwardly worded translation which offers little to replace the poetry Wright has hacked out of it.  Any lover of language will be deeply disappointed by this translation 
 Investment Banker with a conscience, Ben Hartman, and special agent Anna Navaro's plot lines and bodies soon become intertwined in their quest for the secrets of Sigma, an elite cabal with roots in Nazi Germany that is bent on world domination. What starts out as reasonable and entrancing enough genre pulp becomes sheer Bond by the end, but there's no denying Ludlum has a gift for keeping the heat turned up from page to page.  If you are new to espionage fiction and have even slightly literary sensibilities, run don't walk to writers like Alan Furst, Graham Greene, or even John Le Carré. But if strong characters aren't a necessity, you are able to suspend your disbelief, and you are lusting for pure literary sugar, you probably won't be disappointed.  Ludlum is a great author for those who typically spend hours in front of the television and tremble in anticipation at the release of the next Hollywood blockbuster, because he provides essentially the same experience in written form.  He is a master of the wildly oscillating plot line, but barely approaches apprentice status in any other literary area.  I found myself cringing in embarrassment for the author at many points, but to his credit I was compelled to continue turning the pages until I had reached the end.  It's like candy, you can't stop eating it but feel ill once it's gone.  If you are a die hard Ludlumite I admit this is my first foray.  Please point me to a better example of his work if one exists, otherwise I'll invest my time elsewhere and catch up on Mr. Ludlum by proxy when the next "Bourne" film comes out 
 it seemed like a great idea at the time,but it does not work at all.... simply the grass isn't growing,it only made the water in the fountain dirt 
 Old fan as I am, this one (and quite a few of the later ones) was a huge disappointment. Badly written, obvious plot, even more cartoonish characters than usual. Time for Cussler to retire methinks.... 
 These so-called modernization theorists talk about billions of non-white peoples as if we are a homogenous group of barbarians on the outskirts of White City.  Gee, some of them know next to nothing about my experiences and yet they label themselves as "regional specialists?"  Please, they're acting like teenagers saying, "I'm a so-and-so."   Next issue: these writers talk about "black poverty" as something that has nothing to do with "white wealth."  Hello?  Modern European nations were built on (and are maintained with) the blood and toil of peoples in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  One might ask: where did Europeans find land and money for education/infrastructure/social developments, changes important to modern nation building, in the past 300 years? It came from killing, slaving, stealing, and using racism to rationalize economic joint ventures with corrupt dictators in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, AND EUROPE (the ethically questionable multinational CEOs), who all have been selling people out for profits.  One only needs to look around the world today to see the evidence SCREAMING.  What groups are doing most of the work and which groups are mostly kicking back?  Sounds too unbearably ugly?  The book asks: why do many peoples in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are not motivated to participate in modern life?  Duh!  They got no money to go to the "voting booth" because somebody took their "bus fare!"  Being responsible for colonialism does not mean producing racist scholarship to justify Eurocentric condescension, race-based sweatshops, and inane "civilizing crusades."  Well-intentioned Westerners can help a lot simply by seeing themselves as more than a `white person' and recognize the consequences of racism in the modern era 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 I still like the book, but new teachers should be careful when reading it.  Several people have written that Esquith has left out some important details.  For instance, what kind of population is this really?  There are no African-Americans on the cover, or I don't know if they are even directly mentioned in the book.  I don't believe race has any direct bearing on how well a student will do, but a white male compared to a black female teaching African-Americans in a "jungle" will have quite a different experience than a white male like Rafe teaching immigrants or Americans of immigrant families.  Also, are most of these students from single-parent households?  And when immigrants come to the U.S., don't many of them already have somewhat of a work ethic instilled in them due to their history and culture?  Otherwise, I think it is a good book and I enjoyed it very much 
 I was forced to read this book in English class and it is terrible! If you want a book that will put you to sleep at night, this is the one. I dissliked this book because it seems that it is not even supposed to be entertaining! 
 I recently bought 3 items from this brand - Lumiscope. Actually this is the only item that works among them. Though I am kind of suspicious about it's inconsistent readings from time to time.   I think Braun IRT452 is a much better product, which I bought one for my parents in China. During SARS epidemic it never failed and provided consistent readings. 
 Victoria McKernan's book is a disappointing read.  I have already enjoyed Jennifer Armstrong's Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World : The Extraordinary True Story of Shackleton and the Endurance and found it a much better telling of this extraordinary tale.  McKernan's writing did not flesh out the characters and her choppy pacing did not convince this reader to finish the story 
 I would have never personally bought this CD, just because I would never financially contribute to a product that makes money off of putting down a culture (I happen to be Sicilian American and proud of it). A well-meaning friend gave me the CD for my birthday, since I am getting married next year. I can't believe he paid so much for this compilation of a bunch of old Italian songs you could find anywhere, and for so much less (try the library!) I can't believe people are still paying top dollar for a bunch of crappy songs, just because Mob is in the title and the Sopranos are back on HBO. Come on people. Don't you see you are being ripped off? 
 This book is ridiculous. Its extremly biased and racist. Total garbage. Its being tossed in the bonfire after this class is over. I have taken two sociology classes, one used "A down to earth approach" I hardly had as bad a taste in my mouth after reading that one than I do with this propaganda 
 This was a really great story told in a really cool way but with this last book it almost all gose down hill. What was mistrious is now sappy a qultia. This is the down fall of the a great story 
 I really loved the first two books in Fforde's Thursday Next series.  Therefore, I was extremely disappointed in "The Well of Lost Plots."  I literally could not finish it.  I always have a pile of books by my bed and the call of another author was just too great.  I abandoned this book on about page 150.  I was mired in cleverness and inside book jokes.  Other reviewers have noted that this book takes place almost entirely inside the world of books.  I think that may be the problem. There's no connection to the characters in the Outland or the previous storylines.  Also, I began this book within a day of finishing "Lost in a Good Book"; maybe I just needed a break.  Thursday Next is my hero and I wanted to read more about her.  I just couldn't maintain my interest in the plot -- or lack thereof. I'm going to try the fourth book in the series, upon the recommendation of one of the reviewers, but I found this book to be considerably less satisfying than the first two. Be forewarned.  
 It's just that simple.  There is NO credible clinical evidence that chelation therapists do anything for patients except lighten their bank accounts.  If any chelation therapist wants to sue me for writing this, BRING IT ON!  
 This product would be great - if it worked.  I bought this product and it worked great... as advertised... I loved it. Audio, video, IR (remote) worked and were clear. One morning, about 45 days after I bought it, it just stopped working. Assuming the problem was environmental, I had the unit extensively tested by an A/V pro. It was clearly the unit. So I contacted the manufacturer and sent it back. I had high hopes that I just got a lemon, and the next unit would be fine.  The second unit failed within two days (different type of failures). Again I had it checked out, and had the setup and placement checked thoroughly - I mean, what are the odds that two units would fail? Once again, defective equipment, and once again I sent it back.  Third unit lasted a couple of weeks - then failed.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I have extensive A/V experience and love the idea of this product. Don't buy a product that will fail in a couple of days or months. Find another solution 
 I LOVE the series. Have read every book. I am disappointed that they started out in paperback and when it became popular they switched to Hardcover. Tacky in my opinion. But anyhow. I love EVE, Roarke and all of them. In my opinion this one is lame and boring. I actually felt that I eithe wanted to skip pages ( but you never can because right then and there you might miss something ) or just was very eager to read about anything the friends and buttler had to offer. It was okay to find out about another piece of Eve's past. But she goes on and on and on... and yes it is important, and in every book it is mentioned, this time it was written in a very lame and boring style. Very sad. The entire story had no umpf to it. It is as if Nora Roberts wrote it with half her brain already dreaming of her next vacation or she was bored with this as well and couldn't quite get it right. That happens. Doesn't make it bad or the series bad. I LOVE it. But this one, what a drag it was. Blah. I could tell from the beginnig who it was. Now we just had to wait and find out the details that usually EVe puzzles together. It was as Eve was just tired. And the story just didn't move on. No umpf and fire behind it. Just listing of situations, ideas and people's problems. Boring. I recommend this series to anyone interested, but of course hope you will start with the first one. To fully understand the relationship between all of them. And why now do we have to be cross with Mira? It not just sad but stupid as well. Doesn't fit. Never got the point in the last book, why it ticked EVe off so much. So her friend had a bit of a hard time accepting that this icone of hers wasn't all he seemed. Not as if Eve never had her moments of meltdown. Yes she always did her job right but so did Mira, she delivered in the end. I love the relatinoship between Mira and Eve and really didn't need to read that they were not doing well together. And the make up was, okay but not thrilling.  Okay. Enjoy this book, I am sure it will thrill many but for me it was a boring book.  
 If you're looking for a quick mystery read, then this was the way to go.  Frankly, I was disappointed.  After my book club read "Ain't Nobody's Business" we were eager to try one of Wilson Wesley's mysteries.  However, the group's general consensus was that the book was too short, too predictable, and the storyline was not all that original.  I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading her mainstream novels, though 
 I loved these sheets when I first received them and would have written a glowing review then.  However, now that I have washed them twice there is no sheen to them and every single inch on them is pilled.  They look terrible but I haven't slept on them yet since they pilled so I don't know how that will feel.  Hopefully it won't be noticeable.  No one sees these sheets other than me and my husband, but I am very disappointed with these considering I've had cheaper sheet sets for 8 years that haven't reacted this way.  By the way, I ordered the set in chocolate and it is a nice color if brown is what you want.  Maybe it's possible that certain colors pill and some don't?  I have read other reviews that people said their sheets pilled also 
  For the first two thirds of this book is basically an antidotal cultural history of the Basque.  The light style and treatment of the subject are engaging.   However, slowly and by degrees the book spawns a naive ETA apologist essay of sorts  that smoothly threads its way through the continuing cultural discussions of the Basque.  The author blames the victims of ETA for the violence by implying that Spain is bringing ETA violence down on itself by insisting that total independence for the Basque regions of Spain is not negotiable and insisting ETA renounce violence.  The author indulges in hand wringing and whining about anti-terrorist Spanish legislation that allows the authorities to hold a terrorist suspect ten days incommunicado without charges.  The book was written pre 9/11 (and pre 3/11) and consequently the author's arguments come across as rather limp in view of current events.  He also believes that if Spain negotiates or grants more autonomy that ETA will simply "disappear."  I can't tell whether the author is a dupe or just unbelievably naive.  Since this book was written in 1999 Spain has granted more autonomy and guess what?  ETA hasn't gone anywhere and is still murdering people.  This author also talks about ETA and the Catalonia aspirations for more autonomy in the same breath.  Gee I don't remember the Catalans murdering 800+ people.  He also implies that the 40 odd Basques killed are somehow no more reprehensible than the 800+ Spaniards murdered by ETA.  If you follow his logic you arrive at moral equations like 1 ETA terrorist killed in a gunfight = 20 civilians killed with a car bomb.  He also adroitly avoids pesky topics like-   Who exactly are the ETA terrorists?    If they share the same aspiration as the Catalans why did they plant a bomb in a supermarket in Catalonia and kill Catalan women and children?  What about ETA internal violence?  ETA has purged some of his own over the years.  Why avoid that potentially interesting topic?  How is ETA financed?   Is it extortion you think?  Why detail alleged police abuse of ETA suspects and not the ETA war tax?  Why do successful Basques in the Basque provinces avoid any outward show of wealth?  They are afraid of being kidnapped for ransom or having their war tax increased that's why.  The author apparently didn't deign to talk to any of these people or any of the family members of Basque entrepreneurs who were brutalized for not paying their war tax.  Following a line of inquiry like this might force the author to examine inconvenient questions like, what is ETA's overall economic impact on the region?  With so many capable motivated and well educated workers, is ETA why international investors and companies avoid the Basque provinces like the plague?   The author talks at length about the Guggenheim in Bilbo, how it was paid for, it's relative architectural value, the local support it had, etc. without mentioning that ETA tried to bomb it when it opened and shot and killed a policeman near the entrance.  How did this further the goals of ETA?  No wonder no one in Spain or anywhere else is crazy to visit it.  Why talk about GAL's mercenary nature and international component and not about ETA's international operations and links?  Like the seamy links with the IRA and the old un-rehabilitated Gadaffii.  And what about the contract hit they did (unsuccessfully) for the Sandinistas on Eden Pastora?  What about the huge ETA arsenal that accidentally blew up in Panama?    An ETA operative there had acquired the largest arsenal in non-governmental hands ever discovered according to press reports.    Has the author nothing to say about the worldwide network of ETA (often using a Basque restaurant as a front) that funnels arms and money back to their compatriots in Spain?  With an international organization and extensive infrastructure like this it seems to me like they are planning to hang around awhile and have no more intention of "disappearing" than Al Qaeda.  So what is the future of ETA if you reach the wild conclusion that they may not just simply "disappear"?  In the unlikely event an independent Basque country came about might ETA try to install themselves in power by force?  The author admits they are Marxist in nature and only a small minority of Basques support their actions, so it seems contrived that this topic is never broached.  These topics, despite their interesting nature and many sides, might make ETA appear less noble and more like a greedy band of blood thirsty thugs so the author simply ignores them.  Anyone who has even a cursory knowledge of ETA knows that they are about as altruistic as the mafia.  The author takes great care in contorting his little history to hide this fact.  To me, this is totally unacceptable reporting.  I will not buy another of his books. 
 ok for cornbread but NOT at all for scone 
 I understand the reason why it is written in such short form, but I hated it. It was way too much. Way over the top.  It makes for such a difficult read.  The book was pretty dull anyway. Not much happens here 
 Hillary Duff is a cute girl in this movie. Is it just me but is the plot always the same in these movies. A girl's mother dies and she wants to live her dream to honor her mother by going to a school for performing arts. She gets teased by her roommate and by pretty much everyone else. She finds a cute boy and they fall in love. The day of the huge residle, Concert, ECT comes and Her father is stuck in a meeting. And she is very sad. (THAT'S VERY SAD, I MEAN REALLY SAD) No it's just pathetic. Hillary, listen if you don't get into some serious rolls your always gonna be typecast as Lizzie Mcguire. You have to do some acting sister. The movie lacks a plot, the acting is god awful. Comeone do some dramatic roll 
 The original CSI series is FANTASTIC because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence.  This series uses the CSI name without the investigating that makes the original so good.  It is mainly a mellow-drama surrounding the lives of the characters.  Some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor, but there's no mystery 
 Sat down and saw this one on televion.  Only good service was that now I know buying the DVD would be a waste of money.  What was actually achieved by the British is portrayed as an American achievement. Slanders the U-boat men portraying them as heartless marauders. Other than allied Propoganda pieces, There are no incidents of U-boats machinegunning people in lifeboats.   The movie itself I have little respect. Basicly Plotless and  unrealistic. Action scenes unbelievable. Characters Two Dimensional.   This film Awful. 
 I enjoyed the first section of the book with a nice historical overview of clocks.  From there it was disappointing.  If you are a complete beginner with no creativity you may find this helpful, but as an intermediate woodworker I felt most of these could be re-created from a simple photo without a need for critical dimensions.  As well, most of these "clock" plans were simple wood sculptures...with a hole for a $10 clock insert. I think there is only one tall clock in the book and one Shaker style wall clock. If you're a complete beginner, take a look.  If you're looking for more ideas to improve your basic or intermediate skills, keep looking 
 I don't know about anyone else, but this book was the one that made me completely lose interest in this whole series.  This is the most boring one of them all in my opinion, and, well, how many times can the same story be told?  Bad guy wears horribly obvious costume to try to get children, children figure it out, but all the grown ups in the world are too horribly idiotic to see anything, even when it's pointed out to them.  6,000 times.   
 After a semester using the text i have come to the conclusion that the authors, Brehm, Kassin, and Fein, leave more questions then answers and that their sub-par sense of humor is more then just a waste of money.  After reading certain sections i get the feeling that the authors do not clearly understand the issue at hand, but rather throw 15 different research studies at the topic covering their uncertainty and topping it off with a dire attempt at a joke leaving the reader completely ambiguous 
 We know Rita Mae can write.  I remember one Thanksgiving years ago reading parts of one of her books aloud to my sisters and all of laughing so hard we cried.  She had captured reality and presenting it wondrously.  This book however shows none of that talent.  Most of the dialog comes across as extremely stilted and unrealistic 
 After its disturbing and frighteningly chaotic opening sequence, this film swiftly degenerates into another typically stupid, arrogant AMERICAN war film.  Spielberg is a great director, and deserved praise for the opening sequence alone, but what could he do with a screenplay that is little more than a boring melodrama with stereotypical characters who all die in increasingly gruesome ways.  Without the massive buckets of blood, why would we want to watch?  This film is NOT reality, and the fact that it pretends to be reality is offensive to me.  Hollywood's God-complex is its undoing.  Okay lets all pat ourselves on the back one last time for being "brave" enough to revel in the glorious bloody pulp of war.  In my opinion, this film is like a horror film with a bad plot.  Imagine having to fight, bleed, and die all kinds of horrific ways for the honor of saving Matt freakin' Damon.  Just thinking about it makes me want to go watch the ending of The Departed again.  There's a movie with an ending that will leave you smiling 
 I didn't like this book.  Truth be told, I still haven't finished it, and I bought it over six months ago.  The characters are boring; the situation (while ripe with potential) drags; and the recipes don't even sound good.  I am supremely disappointed, as I usually love what Nora Ephron does.  Bummer 
 As tempted as I am to give this book 3 stars, 2 stars is closer to rating the whole.  First, this book is for the novice. If you're more than a little familiar with medieval European history, you'll find nothing new here except Cahill's sometimes quirky interpretations of people and events. For some, these interpretations alone will be enough to revisit Hildegard, Abelard, and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Those who've read full length biographies of the main "characters" or the Durants' Story of Civilization or even Freeman's Closing of the Western Mind may want to skip this volume.  The point of Cahill's Hinges of History series seems to be "if you think history isn't fun and relevant, think again." I have a soft spot for such ventures so Cahill starts out in the plus column with me. I enjoyed "How the Irish Saved Civilization" for what is was, pop history meant to whet but not satisfy the appetite. Approach this volume with that in mind and you will likely enjoy it. I found numerous points of disagreement with his "theories" - the rise of feminism, for instance, hardly began with Eleanor!  Unfortunately, Cahill goes off the rails in the introduction and in the conclusion. In the Intro Cahill praises Italy's anti-death penalty stance and then detours to tell us about his "friend" who was on Texas's death row for a crime "he probably didn't commit", was a great guy and was ultimately executed and isn't modern day America wrong wrong wrong about the death penalty. This left me asking two questions: 1) huh? and 2) why doesn't Cahill write a book and tell his friend's story instead of shoehorning it into the Middle Ages?  When Cahill rants about the pedophile scandals in the US Catholic Church while sadly ignoring similar scandals in Ireland and in the Anglican Church in Australia it feels like what it is - a rant, not a commentary on history or current events. When he then makes veiled comparisons between Philip the Fair of France - who is barely mentioned in the main text - and a certain American President (who he doesn't name so I guess I won't either), Cahill's take on Philip the Fair is so wrong-headed and lame, on top of being entirely unaddressed in the previous pages that I couldn't help feeling more than a little tricked. Again, why doesn't Cahill take his strongly held views about current events and write about them on their own? As it is, Cahill risks making the entire book look like a scam - he's not really interested in the Middle Ages, just scoring a few points. I don't believe that is the case but Cahill's antics damage his credibility even as a popular historian. Hence the 2 stars. I hope Cahill's editors exercise a bit more restraint for the next volume of Hinges 
 Overall, it's disappointing. The book merely scratches the surface on a wide range of topics and therefore is only slightly useful for someone who already knows what processes are or can build a kernel. Still haven't found a replacement for O'reilly's Understanding the Linux Kernel, which has detailed coverage of such topics as processes, scheduling, and memory management. 
 Rancid, arguably the greatest punk rock band of our generation had completed their trilogy of masterpieces with "Life Won't Wait", and now what follows is the big disappointment. this is not a bad record, but it is a bad rancid record. Rancid are great for making that no 2 of their albums sound the same, and this album is no exception, except what we get with this release sounds contrived and forced. they have been known for their brand of catchy, sing along anthemic punk rock, and this is what made them so great, and now they are offering their stab at hardcore in the vein of Anti-Nowhere League or The Exploited. There are a few stand out tracks such as "Let Me Go", "Rwanda" and "Radio Havana" but the rest of the cd i find myself skipping through. anybody who is not already endeared to rancid and is a fan of hardcore 70's/80's era punk then you may enjoy this album but to anyone who grew onto rancid by way of "Let's Go" and the masterpiece "...And Out Come The Wolves", might be disappointed like i was 
 The idea behind this toy was a cute one, but it stops there.  Within five minutes of playing with this toy, it broke.  The dog halter broke off the wire leash and could not be repaired.  The whole thing ended up in the trash on Christmas Day! 
 i have my number.how about myself number 
 that I even read this book!  Even knowing it's a re-release doesn't help! My sister-in-law and I are avid Plum fans and I guess it will have to suffice to say that we will simply stick to the Plum titles and leave the rest behind.  This book was SO light, I'm surprised it didn't just float away.  I think successful writers should not be so money-hungry that reprinting of old titles becomes the name of the game... JMHO     
 Although the Classical pieces are some of the best, the fact that the short video footage has been looped for what feels like 3 dozen times makes the whole package a visual rip-off. I didn't buy it for the Classical Music. I bought it for HD Space-to-Earth footage. At the end of the video, there's a message that claims this is all the footage that exists from the Shuttle program. I saw a lot more of it on one of the HD channels on Comcast. Actually, I thought this BluRay would give me the rest of that footage (not covered on Comcast) My disappointment was proportional to my excitement! Don't buy 
 Not only this book is poorly written but in fact its also written in a very confusing manner. Dr. Kreinin does not provide us with adequate examples for the topic he discusses and furthermore there is not glossary in the textbook, which is crucial for the students to get some quick facts without memorizing the entire terminology used in the book. I was surprised to find this book as part of the required readings for classes at Michigan State University and Northern Michigan University. I recommend that this bok may not be used as part of the curriculum for the students. It is not helpful and its over-priced relative to its limited use 
 First of all, who says George had "sad eyes"? I received this book as a gift from my Mom, who knows I love the Beatles, but knows next to nothing about the Beatles themselves. Still, she probably knows more than the author of this awful book, which was obviously written for no other reason than to exploit. Save your money. You can learn more about George Harrison by simply listening to his music and reading his lyrics 
 We bought the 'Amazing Allysen' doll for our 7 year old.  Unfortunately, Allysen is more aggravating than amazing.  She's a pretty doll, but we had a lot of difficulty "programming" her.  You have to squeeze her hand to set the date, time, etc.  No problem, right?  Wrong.  Her hand was so hard to squeeze, my daughter couldn't do it, so I tried to help her.  Long before Allysen was fully programmed, I had to hand her to my husband.  He was a little more sucessful and we now have her programmed.  The other complaint I have is difficulty in communicating answers to Allysen.  She doesn't seem to hear well--I know she's a doll, but the commercials showed a far more advanced Allysen than we received.  She'll ask my daughter what she wants to do next and give her 2 or 3 choices--but she doesn't always understand the answer, even if it's repeated several times CLEARLY.  My daughter has played with her maybe 3 times since Christmas.  She says it's just too irritating.  That's why I'm giving 'Aggravating Allysen' 2 stars.  
 Based on the novel The Big Arm by Clark Howard with a screenplay by Robert Roy Pool, this drama directed by Ben Bolt feels like an adaptation of a large canvas novel with all the detail left in, so that everything reads as subsidiary. Set in the Chicago of the 1950's, Matt Dillon stars as a dice player from Indiana seeking the big time. However, when you're juggling at least 4 plots it's only natural that not all of them will come together for a satisfying conclusion. The most promising one concerns Dillon's Hustler-like competition with Tommy Lee Jones as the owner of a strip club, with Jones having the same spot between the eyebrows as Dillon. The problem with filming dice is that the actual game is monotonous, so the best Bolt could do is create tension by delaying the next roll or the raising of financial stakes, though he does provide an early montage of Dillon with David Marshall Grant on a winning spree and falling dice and money to the sounds of Shake, Rattle and Roll on the soundtrack. The only other visual trick is the sparks of an overhead train on it's tracks as Dillon and Diane Lane as Jones' stripper wife kiss to Fever. The best of the screenplay is a laugh line of sarcasm and forboding given to Meg Hogarth as Dillon's mother re his dice mentor's funeral "I nearly got crushed in the crowd", and Cherry Jones as a Patsy Cline-like singer who sneaks up behind Dillon, covering his eyes with a guess who? Dillon says her perfume gives her away and she replies " Aint nobody gonna give me away but my daddy". This use of eyes and the eyes of the dice are also parallel with Bruce Dern as the husband of Lee Grant, Dillon's employer. Dern is a former dice champ who has been blinded, but unfortunately this plot point gets no payoff. Dillon is also given two romantic partners in Lane and Suzy Amis as a mother of a child out of wedlock. The madonna/whore dichotomy is rather obvious, and the symbolism worse, with Amis' child scoring points for her and the way Lane is presented so unflatteringly scores points against her. Lane's fan dance doesn't help, since the focus on the scen is more Dillon's twisted attraction/repulsion. The 1950's period works for Dillon's razor etched beauty, the perfect locale for his photographer Bruce Weber appeal, and he even gives a Method touch to the way he hits his own face with a restaurant menu. Watch for Lolita Davidovich as another of Jones' strip club entertainers 
 I tried really hard to like this book, but I found it just a poor rehash of information already put forward by William Sutherland D.O, the father of Cranial Osteopathy and John E. Upledger, D.O., O.M.M., the developer of CranioSacral Therapy.  For a true Visionary approach to "CranioSacral" work, you should consult the works of Sutherland and Upledger 
 I got this for my son and he did have fun with it, but I spent a lot of time trying to unjam the coins from the mechanism. As an actual coin sorter it stinks. The number of coins (or even the types of coins) that end up in each roll is fairly inconsistent. Also, it comes with a top to keep little fingers out of it, but there is no way to keep the top on, so my son got his finger caught by the rotating coin sorter once and was pretty scared until I could pry his finger out of it.  I wouldn't reccomend it 
 I bought this book, thinking the same as another reviewer, that it would be about DETAILS, not basic stuff.  I was extremely disappointed.  This is good for high school students or a high school guidance office, but it's not useful for someone who is starting out of college with a professional career.  A MUCH better choice would be The New Women's Dress For Success, by Molloy.  This book was extremely thin, 64 pages, and overpriced.  I paid much less for a different book that was MUCH more informative and helpful 
 It amazes me that in this day and age, a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book, and which uses an African-American maid and a Korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast, which uses time travel merely as a conceit, with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships: it obviously doesn't have any impact on the eternally horny Henry and Claire, can be taken seriously. This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a "love makes the family" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film 
 This timer arrived in two pieces  -  top half and bottom half.  They could be reconnected, but would never stay connected.  This is a piece of junk that I have thrown away.  Made in China 
 Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me.  When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon.  The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded.  Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem.  The plot was good, but moved slowly.  I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much.  I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store.  I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it 
 This 600+ page endeavor in tedium has quite a few clever and witty observations about the current state of media, technology, etc., but is undone by the author's endless tone of self-congratulation and his complete inability to MOVE THE STORY ALONG. The plight of George and Lizzie is secondary to all of Andersen's cheeky observations and endless descriptive dreck. There's no sense rehashing the plot because there really isn't one. For a story intending to portray life in the modern fast lane, so little seems to actually happen, and it's hard to care about any of the characters since they serve mainly as props and time-killers in between the author's next clever zinger. Most of the time, the author's supposedly keen insight into the 21st century is no more than well-dressed but thinly-veiled cliches (this is particularly prevalent - and annoying - when the author shifts the setting out of New York City to the West Coast and shows his complete ignorance of anything outside the 212 area code), and you get the distinct impression that the author is writing just to hear himself talk. Fresh and invigorated at the start, it doesn't take long for Turn of the Century to wear thin and dwindle to a boring, lethargic crawl. All in all, a very disappointing read, since I was always a fan of his work in Spy Magazine. This is precisely the kind of "hip, cutting edge" fiction - with it's media barbs and heavy handed approach to social satire - which would fool critics into thinking the author really had something to say 
 Terry Silber deserves credit for making her move to Maine work. It should  be noted that farming is not the reason for her success, retail would be  more accurate. Throughout the book there is the feeling that she feels  herself above her new neighborhood. I would be curious to see how her new  homestate views her.  A finacial success; she has achieved.  Beyond that 
 This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down.  It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest.  There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime.   There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.  I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction.  Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead. 
 I wasn't too into this one. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck's fiction, but this memoir is rather dull. I was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of America at the time he wrote it. But as an older man (as he even admits) he isn't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths. The ones that he does write  about come across as a bit uninspired. Nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he doesn't have too much to say.   The one highlight was the last couple of chapters, when he goes to the South (New Orleans) and witnesses all the slimy, seperatists as they scream and holler, with pure craven hatred at the first little black children to be integrated into public schools. He is disillusioned and angry and when he tells the tale of what he saw it is absolutely heartbreaking.   As much as a mediocre work as it was, I did take an interest in it because I am a fan of Steinbeck. It was cool to hear him write a memoir. Other Steinbeck fans make get something out of it as well and for them I recommend it, just on that basis. As long as you take into account the stuff I said above. If you haven't read Steinbeck, please...start with "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Tortilla Flat." Those are much better works and will give you something to go on if you try to read this 
 		Although the premise of this book is brilliant, perceptive and absolutely vital to the next few years;  Reich sadly presents an incisive example of the economic thinking and progress that made Democrats relevant in the 1930s.  	It's years ahead of the Bush ideologues, who act and think as if the 20th Century never happened.  Reich is progressive enough to adopt the policies of the 1930s, and he does exceptionally well.  He knows how to blow an eloquent "toot" on the whistle of a charming old steam locomotive;  like many other politicians of nostalgia, he thinks it gives him the right to fly the Space Shuttle.  	The world is changing.  As an example, Wal-Mart can forecast with 5 percent accuracy how many copies of a new video disc it will sell, and it has that figure within four hours of the disc going on sale.  That's where the brains of Wal-Mart is located, and it's why the company needs only $10-an-hour clerks for the check-out counter and to stuff the shelves.  	When check-out counters were complicated, it made sense to hire $20-an-hour clerks.  Now the job involves holding a bar code in front of a laser scanner, it has become another job where many companies could use "los barratos illegales".  	No one has a "right" to a specific job;  work must be earned by those who acquire the necessary skills.  Fifty years ago, it made sense that American auto workers were the best paid in the world, their assembly work required skill.  Today, truly skilled jobs are done by robots;  assembly workers do low skill work that is too menial to be automated.  	Success today depends on the desire to learn technical and personal skills needed for a specific job. Sadly, too many people have VW "Bug" skills and Escalade attitudes.  Sorry, life isn't like that any more.  	Let's do some numbers:  there are about 190 million Americans in the labour force, plus 10 million unemployed;  at least 10 million illegal aliens have jobs here.  If Reich is right, then how can millions of illegal migrants with about a Grade 3 formal education get jobs that Americans with high school diplomas can't hold?  Instead, every illegal migrant with a job is another proof that Reich is outdated.  	Reich completely ignores this issue;  instead, he offers Depression-era solutions for the future knowledge economy.  There's a good business reason why there are millions of illegal migrants in America, and why no administration will take action against them.  Reich, as a former Secretary of Labour, should address that issue.  	The future is ahead.  Americans deserve a better than going back to the 1930s with Reich's liberal allies,  or back to the 1890s with Bush's conservatives of greed, cronyism, graft and war.  This book shows Reich would have been a great Labour secretary for Franklin Roosevelt, but he was merely a seat warmer in the 1990s.  	Please, we're all going to live in the future.  So, let's think about the future, instead of resurrecting colorful but antiquated policies of the past.  Reich should do much better, or else we'll all be Bushwhacked by the sultans of greedy-nomics.  
 She routinely misrepresents evidence and publishes hearsay along with her own distorted theories.  She generally doesn't understand the first thing about computing technology, security or the voting process.  Sadly, I agree that electronic voting is a serious problem and there are terrible security implications with how it is being conducted.  However, Bev Harris is NOT the person to get answers from.  Her conclusions are wrong and she ends up trashing the very people struggling to help the problem.  And yes, I have had the displeasure of watching her distort the facts in front of my very eyes.  She's part of the problem, not the solution 
 Had this book been written in the mid 80's it may have been vaguely cutting edge.  As a first edition published in 2004, it is sadly behind the times.  It gives me the small town "Waiting for Guffman" feel, and NOT in a good way.  The commentary in this book is not helpful and should be eliminated almost in its entirety.  I also did not find any of the games listed as new material.  These games were either old games that had been re-named or fragmented versions of other games.  One google search on the internet would have brought me closer to a new game than the entirety of this book.      Many of the scene examples in the book break the iron clad laws of Improv:  1) Yes, and 2) Don't ask questions and 3) No real time I.S.C. (Improv Stage Combat).  As a teaching tool, especially for young children (is the target market for this book middle school children?) this book missed the mark.  If a teacher wants to teach children to be polished and clever Improvisers, (s)he needs to make sure the children have a strong basic understanding of the Improv rules, especially for short form games.  The author of this book needs to read the Pearls of Wisdom from "Truth in Comedy" by Charna Halpern, Del Close, Kim Johnson.  (The rest of this book involves a lot of name dropping and shoulder patting, but the bulleted pearls are helpful for beginners).  She should then read anything by Viola Spolin, "Theater Games for the Classroom: A Teacher's Handbook" or "Improvisation for the Theater".  She should also read "Group Improvisation: The Manual of Ensemble Improv Games" by Peter Gwinn.  I teach high school Improv and am currently putting together an Improv book list of items that will be added to the school library.  Unfortunately, this book is nowhere on that list. 
 The year was 1990, the sound was "new jack swing"...R&B laced with hip-hop..the group was Bell, Biv, Devoe..3 former members (Ronnie Bivins, Ricky Bell, Mike Devoe) split off from New Edition, the hugely successful R&B "boy band" of the 80s. The band racked up a quick 6 Top 100 Billboard hits and then disappeared from the charts.  HIGHLIGHTS: The title track is far and away the best song here and the only hit that still sounds pretty fresh. The group moves from strength to strength with sharp hip-hop beats, occasional harmony, and a really funky break (after "Blow!"). Outside of that, the album track "Ain't Nuttin' Changed" is a nice slice of old school hip-hop with a Sly and the Family Stone sample to boot.   LOWS: "Do Me!" was a big hit back when, but the junior high locker room ideas about sex are pretty boring to me in my 30s (it's no "Let's Get it On"). "Word to the Mutha" and "I Do Need You" don't really go anywhere musically.  BOTTOM LINE: This band was definitely a singles act, you don't really need the album unless you're a diehard fan who wants the extended remix of the title track and album track "Ain't Nuttin' Changed" which is also pretty tough. Outside of that, all the hits can be found on the "20th Century Masters:Millennium Edition" (ASIN B000066F0S) or if you really only want "Poison","B.B.D.", and "Do Me!" you might go for New Edition's "All the Number Ones" (ASIN B00004T0EB) which gives you those 3 tracks plus several big 80s hits from their old band 
 These shakers really don't dispense salt and pepper very well.  They're cute and small, but my guests have to shake for an extended period of time to get anything out of them (and I was using regular table salt and pepper -- nothing fancy). They're really not functional -- what more can I say?  Skip these, there are better sets out there 
 I have found that this book was a weak and uncreative attempt to brand "BLUR" as a modern innovation of conducting business when it has simply re-spun and devalued traditional business practices into a dot com unsustainable ideal. This book preaches that there is little need for the tangible bottom line for the intangibles of business out weigh the value of the actual assets. That may be partially true; however, what actually happens when that model is embraced is uncontrollable corruption in the market. If you are a beginner in the business world and have trouble reading, you will find a few good business ideas and examples within the double spaced, trivially written text. However, as it was published in 1999 most of the ideas are now a BLUR of the past. There are better books out there. Don't waste your time 
 Could have been condensed into a much shorter book. Filled with trivial details... it was boring 
 I could see how lame this book was going to be after the initial couple of chapters. I could also predict the ending with more precision than any other Patterson novel I've read. Not that there weren't some nice twists and turns in the middle, but the book was just plain nauseating. I lost track of how many times Suzanne mentioned how happy and perfect everything was in her life.   This certainly isn't your normal Patterson novel, so proceed with caution. 
 These plays were okay, I'm glad I rented them before buying them.  The props and things were very nice, the actors didn't gel well with each other or connect with their characters and the singing was mediocre ( definitely no Tyler Perry quality on that note) but the messages were good just seemed a little unrealistic and too drawn out.  I thought Alexander O'Neal sang in one of them but he didn't 
 I really like Levine's book Ella Enchanted. But I would not recommend The Wish for adults, let alone children. It is too vulgar 
 If you like neurotic self-involved women who never know how to gain control of their lives, this book is for you.  If not, just pass this by. I know she won all kinds of awards from her other books, but this is full of whining and self-pitty. In fact it feels so thin it feels like the notes she took for the article she wrote for a magazine. I couldn't even get past the first section and I'm a huge reader 
 Well, I read through about 60 five and four star reviews before I gave up on trying to find somebody who was willing to tackle the problematic ending of this novel. Let me start off by saying that I was loving this book all the way through Part 5. The cliffhangers were great, I loved the authentic Southern voice King breathed into each of the characters. He had crafted something so good. And then he didn't treat it with the care it deserved. Part 6 was weak, seeming inconsistent with the characters and the tone of the book.  The problem is you have characters that have displayed heroism in every other circumstance suddenly choose cowardice. Paul, Brutal, Harry, Dean and even good John Coffey all decide there is nothing left to do but go through with the motions. Is it their failure in this decision that leads to Paul's unhappiness, his "damnation" as he states?  This book starts with a message of tremendous hope. There are miracles. God works through the most unlikely of instruments. But the book concludes with near despair, that God permits all the bad things to happen and responds that "He doesn't care." What a careless way to conclude-completely sapping out of us the hope that the rest of the book has enfused us with! It is affronting to a spritual mind. Obviously God does care, pouring out grace and miracles so often that we've labeled them commonplace, and commissioning messengers that mankind kills. Paul Edgecomb is such a great heroic character throughout the book, King treats him so poorly in the denoument. It pains me to say it, because I feel like I am chastising a wise old friend. Yet he need not look to the heavens for the cause of so much suffering, but deep inside for his own shortcomings in saving an innocent life 
 I had polished off all the Anne Rice books (actually read them through several times), several non-fiction books about the real Count Vlad, and was looking for other vampire-themed material when I stumbled across this book.  First of all, let me say on a positive note that there were several interesting subjects that the author brought out in her book.  For example, the point she made that St.-Germain (our leading vampire) was, when alive, considered average height, even tall.  But now, on account of his preternatural inability to change, is below average height, with small hands and feet.  Interesting point, since it is well documented that humans, as a whole, are indeed increasing in average height over the centuries.  There are several other examples of interesting tid-bits that are woven into the story.  Bravo to the author for some good research and application.  Unfortunately, however, these spots of interest were few and far between.  On the whole I found the book's characters to be flat and unentertaining and the plot ludicrous (even for a vampire novel).  The story line revolves around a cult of devil worshipers who are intent on sacrificing St.-Germain's beloved, Madelaine, in order to imbue themselves with power.  While the descriptions of their debauchery is certainly colorful, it's also completely unbelievable.  And despite the graphic picture we are painted of their rapes, murders and collusions, the cult never really gives off a believable air of menace.  They are third-rate bullies who should have been killed off in the first chapter.  Instead they are allowed to rampage through the entire book - mostly because the main character and vampire-not-so-extraordinaire, St.-Germain, is a complete "woose", with no backbone, and no menace.   The folklore image of the vampire is partially defined by his menace, his otherworldly power, his edge of danger and, yes, to some degree evil - even if that evil is tempered and restrained.  That is part of what makes the vampire lore so magnetic - he, the vampire, is a creature beyond human limitations, morality or restraints.  But author Yarbro seems to have taken the exact opposite approach.  She has produced a vampire character who is more limited, less powerful, less menacing...more human.  But the attempt is not carried off with any success.  Instead you find yourself sighing, rolling your eyes and wishing St.-Germain would act like the vampire he is supposed to be.  Let me put it this way...Lestat would have eaten these so called cultists in the first paragraph then gone on to bigger and more interesting things.  St.-Germain procrastinates, hides, hesitates and all but allows them to kill both him and Madelaine.  He is a pathetic excuse for a vampire who is, in the end, only worthy of a yawn. 
 As many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction, however midway it turns into a romance novel.  I give it 3 stars for holding my attention.  A good beach read that can get you thinking (a little) about a time past.  The one star is a mistake and I cannot seem to change it.   3 ***  stars 
 Only to be used if you want to learn to converse a bit in Japanese. I used this for couple weeks- and I found that "Japanese Step by Step : An Innovative Approach to Speaking and Reading Japanese " is a better option. 
 It is not easy to fathom what exactly is wrong with this novel.  Some reviewers complained about the constant pop culture references, unintelligible unless you have watched a lot of TV, but this is just a minor point: people who do not watch television often may miss the full edge of the puns, but they will still understand that they are faced with a pun. Other reviewers seem to be complaining about the explicit slash content, the main character, Tony, being explicitly gay. To those I can only say:"Grow up!" Nobody has to agree perforce to homosexuality in the fiction one reads, but if one does not, it would be best to simply say so, not making excuses. After all gay readers, up to a couple of years ago, had to relate perforce to straight characters only. I make a point of always saying if a book I read has gay content so that those unwilling to face it can skip it.  Back to the book.  Characters are likeable, a little sketchy, but this being an entertainment series one supposes they will get more depth along the way. One supposes, but still a little more depth... more attention to Tony's heartaches for example, to Henry's scruples?  The TV setting is allright, full of possibilities and potential.  In my opinion it is the script which sucks (hey, read a couple of Tony's lines and you will slang yourself silly before you realise it). Whole paragraphs at a time are unfinished, clumsy. This makes the reading more difficult, less enjoyable, slow. You do not want slow when reading fantasy, unless it is gorgeous writing. There being many other paragraphs perfectly good one has to suppose a lack of concentration, hurry or both.  Ms Huff is a successful writer. How many children -if any of course- does she have to send to college that she cannot take more time to spend on reviewing? 
 Liked this magazine enough to order it but it gets one star for wasting my money. Thought it'd be simple enough to order it from amazon like i do everything else. But instead i've paid and never received it. I haven't been able to log a compaint with amazon cause every time i do it links me somewhere else, so this is the first chance i've had to even say i've been ripped off. They may eventually send it but it's not likely at this point, it's been a couple months now 
 The premise was great. The storytelling, very awkward. The technological information could have been interesting, but it read like an instruction manual. I give one star for the final cat-and-mouse and another for the funny way Mr. Clancy portrayed the Soviet apparatchiks 
 Overall, not an entertaining book.  I struggled to stay interested in the story despite my track record of loving books having to do with any Hollywood subject matter.  I found the characters lacked depth and the end was incredibly cliche.  There was very little creativity at all 
  Mad cow disease finally gets its own horror flick with this latest offering from Fangoria and the Irish Film Board. In this case, this ultra-violent strain of mad cow disease can be passed on to humans, turning them into zombies. It's hard to think of this set-up as being anything but a rip-off of 28 DAYS LATER with cows instead of monkeys being the initial carrier of the infection.  So this bovine infection starts causing people to attack each other in rural Ireland. Maybe I'm just getting numbed by all the zombie movies, but this one seemed like a weak attempt to capitalize on the zombie craze. Unfortunately, I think that the expiration date on zombie movies may be coming soon, if it's not already passed.  There's one pretty good moment where this girl sucks out a guy's eye with a vacuum cleaner, but otherwise this is a pretty standard zombie flick. You just can't make the same old zombie movie and expect people to be scared. You have to find a way to make it unique. Look at poor George Romero, who returned to the genre that he helped create, only to find mediocre box office success. As much as I hate to admit it, it might be time for filmmakers to take a little break from zombie movies, at least until they can find a fresh approach.   This dead meat is not fresh or very nutritional. It's more like meat loaf. When you've got meat that's about to go bad, sometimes the only thing you can do is mix it up with other ingredients and make it into meat loaf. 
 I read Diana Palmer for a easy no brains love story this was not it. To many plots and relationships going on and not enough on the main couple. I give it 2 stars because its Diana Palmer 
 Compiling two specials made for TNT, and Chuck Jones' 1941 "Horton Hatches The Egg" (From his early Disney-like peroid) to boot, it's nothing more than a thrownaway! Get the DVD of "How The Grinch Stole Christmas" and "Horton Hears A Who" instead 
 I'm not a fan of mysteries to begin with.  However, my public library has a limited selection of audio books, so I take what I can get.  I am a voracious reader, and I listen to audios to get more "reading" in, as you can listen and do other things.  I much prefer the Lillian Jackson Braun "cat" books, at least there is some humor, and I like the "mystery" part of these books better than Deaver's.  Sorry to all the Deaver fan's out there...I HAVE enjoyed a few of his books, but I get tired of the "same ole-same ole" 
 Maybe I'm daft, but I can't make a decent espresso with these pods in my machine. I've tried tamping them, which doesn't work well and I've tried just placing them in the filter. In both cases I get watery dribble but no espresso.  As with other European products (think IKEA) there are no printed instructions in English, just line art drawings. Perhaps I'm just doing something wrong.  I like the concept of pods, but I'll stick to beans instead 
 This is an okay read - nothing more, nothing less. The overall plot is very interesting and the story is well told up to a point. The real flaw though is the rushed, and in my opinion, corny, ending to this book. It really was substandard, straight-to-video, B-movie type of stuff (and yes, I am reviewing the book). I won't give too much away, but why at the very end would the chief baddie be the one to carry out 'the deed', and not one of his followers? And why was it the 'good' guy who tracked him down and stopped him carrying out 'the deed' - surely the police / FBI would have got him?   As with John Case's previous book, The Genesis Code, the initial plot will have you hooked, but as the story drags on it does become a little silly and rushed.   
 This book is another addition to the unsuccessful but well-funded attempt to give credibility to the allegations of a genocide and blaming Turks as perpetrators. If the wartime dead of Armenians is considered a genocide,  then there was a Turkish Genocide perpetrated by Armenians during which 2.5  million Turks were killed. Why to honor Armenian dead during World War I as  "genocide" victims, but to blame 2.5 million Turks who died  during the same war as perpetrators of a genocide  
 Extremely difficult to dig through the excessive examples in order to find the relevant theorems and results. Because of this, the problems at the end of each chapter become exercises in tedium, as more time is spent searching for the necessary theorems in the text than in actually working out the solution.   I do not recommend 
 I loved the first Santa Clause, so I was excited  to see this one.  but it's so lame!  it's like they decided at the last minute to hurry and make this in time for christmas. the storyline is far from solid,  the lines in this one that are supposed to be funny are just flat, and it really doesn't have the warm & cozy 'feel good' that the first one had.  I don't think I'll be seeing #3, after how disappointing this one was.   : 
 Without a doubt, Understanding The Bible, 6th Edition, is a "hatchet job" on the Bible and, as a result, will test the faith of Jews and Christians alike.  But fear not!  Those who are even moderately confident in their religion will see through the author's relentlessly atheistic opinions and view it as an untapped gold mine for the Christian apologetics crowd.  When Mr. Harris (in his chapter bibliographies) recommends, among others, the works of those false witnesses over at the "Jesus Seminar", R.Funk, et al, and their New Thought babblings, then I came to understand the real truth about this book and the author's deceptive intentions.  I have only one thought for those unbelievers who think the Bible and Christ's teachings are wrong and pure folly.  If it is so; if Christianity is wrong, then there can be only ONE FOLLY that replaces it:  the folly of trying to pretend that there is some meaningful reason for life on this earth.     I feel truly sorry for Mr. Harris and those frantic souls similarly aligned; they have nothing but death in a void as their final reward.  This is why they are so angry, pessimistic and cynical in their religious criticism.  As Thomas à Kempis said in My Imitation of Christ (early 1400's) , "All carnal joys enter pleasantly, but in the end bring remorse and death."  As a result, "There is no peace in the heart of a carnal man."  May God bless and keep you all.  Amen. 
 This book is a part of the Yale Intellectual History of the West series, edited by J. W. Burrow, William Bouwsma, and Frank M. Turner. I bought this book in search of a contemporary synthesis for the period in question: 1848-1914. I wanted to learn more about the influence of such individuals as Darwin, Freud, Nietzsche, and Marx.  What I discovered, contrary to the alluring blurbs on the back of the book, was nearly impenetrable. I could not identify an argument from page to page, let alone a thesis for entire chapters. The author occasionally makes interesting pairings of individuals to discuss (Bakunin and Wagner, for instance) or statements about this or that, but the overall effect is frustratingly fragmentary and at times superficial. The latter is particularly in evidence in the author's coverage of Darwin and evolution. Having just read Gertrude Himmelfarb's Darwin and the Darwinian Revolution (a masterwork of intellectual history), I wanted to place those particular ideas in a wider context. But Burrow gives them short shrift, devoting only a few pages to them.  I could forgive this shortcoming if it were limited to Darwin, but other heavyweights of the period receive the same abbreviated treatment. Although the author imparts a great deal of knowledge about lesser figures of the period, he seems unwilling to devote more attention to certain key individuals. I did not detect that this choice was dictated by some post-modern egalitarianism or equivalency, but I could not detect any coherence in the narrative, either.  It could be that I am not the intended reader for this book. The reviewer in the Times Literary Supplement concluded that the book was "for people who know about Taine and Renan, have heard of Virchow and Helmholtz, but have no idea that Johann Muller's laboratory in Berlin was 'an intellectual power-house of the mid-century.'" That description excludes me (a zero score), but if this book turns off an avid reader of the TLS (and an admirer of intellectual historians such as Crane Brinton and Arthur Lovejoy), it may only be appropriate for academic historians.  Those who are undeterred or unintimidated will still undoubtedly benefit from the book's decent index 
 Despite the fact that CliffsNotes has helped me through one too many an English Lit quiz, I believe that this is taking it a little too far. Catcher in the Rye is, by far, one of my favorite books of all time, and to create CliffsNotes for it requires something less than academic foresight. Talk about not being able to see the forest for the trees. The entire point of J.D. Salinger's one and only published novel is that though we do need to carry out our schooling, education isn't there to cloak the mind into believing that regurgitating facts onto meaningless scraps of wood pulp. It's there to take the free thought that we have and expand it, so that we can better express ourselves, and not bury who we are behind a pile of textbooks. The specifics of the life of Holden Caulfield are not important. The generalities of the life of Holden Caulfield are not important. What is important is the ideals expressed in the book--not where Holden went to school, not how many times he mentions the hunting hat, not where the ducks do actually go. Both teachers and students of today must learn that teaching others and yourselves that this is all that's important is like building a wall around yourself. So read the book. It'll bring you to something closer to happiness than an A ever will. And hell, if you actually read the thing, you might ace it anyway 
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 How do you spell 'sucks'? Easy - A-L-E-X-A-N-D-E-R!  I loved Stone's JFK, but this... Words fail me, but I'll try to find a few. Okay, the pros? Angelina Jolie. I've never been a big fan of hers, but, boy, was she the hottest woman alive in this movie! More pros? Hmmm. Certainly not the action sequences which were muddled and hard to follow. Certainly not the weird Irish accents the lead characters adopted. Certainly not the story.  This is just one of those films you believe can be so bad and that something cool is gonna happen the instant you hit the off button, so it stays your finger. My advice? HIT THAT BUTTON!  And I won't even mention the blonde wig! 
 This is a very readable mystery with several cute twists.  If you live in or near the central coast of California you will love the way she works in many points of interest.  The story is filled with love of man-woman, mankind and dog.  You'll love it 
 Don't buy the directors cut.  Badder Santa is absolutely hysterical.  For some strange reason the director decided to make a "director's cut" that is a neutered version of "badder santa".  I bought it yesterday when it came out and the internal dialogue from Billy Bob in the first scene was missing.  The celebration in the bar after the first mall "heist", where Billy Bob proclaims he's giving up drinking, was missing.  The next scene where Billy Bob was stealing drinks from the bar on the beach and fights with the bartender was missing.  That was enough for me.  I immediately shut it off and Best Buy agreed to let me swap it for "Badder Santa" due to the false impression of a "longer and fuller" cut than it's predecessor, as is the industry standard.    I was duped.  Please buy "Badder Santa" instead.    This is a watered down/Walmart version of a classic, not an extended cut 
 I bought this book but I did not really read carefully, this book has knitting, and more knit than crochet and the crocheted scarve are nothing worth looking at, yarn they use not as nice as the knit.  More to beginner crocheters.. They could of been bette 
 wallbangin' first off is badly in need of editing.  constructions like, "remarkably successfully", make this text even more difficult to read.  gang writing is one aspect of gang culture, whereas for graffiti writers, writing, for fame, style, etc. is the focal point of the culture. the constant blurring of these facts makes it difficult to discern the actual arguement. this book is all over the place and leaves us with a poor, undetailed account into two separate cultures, simply because they use public space for unintended purposes 
 Wow, what a disappointment. Great actors with a god-awful script from a fantastic book. I loved the book so much, I just couldn't wait to see the movie and I missed it theaters so I watched it this weekend from Netflix. What can I say? It's BORING! I'm not a huge fan of Tom Hanks, especially with this mullet-esque hair (it's ok to hate me), but I love Iam McCellan and Jean Reno, but these great actors just couldn't save this movie. And Sofie Neveau was SO much more interesting in the book. Don't waste your time on this one 
 	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a story of love and compassion, which takes place during the beginnings of the French Revolution. Despite the fact that many aspects of the revolution are portrayed well in the novel, the book is still a tiring read and requires a strong liking for Dickens' writing style.  	Throughout the novel, Dickens bogs the story down with excessive descriptions and meaningless scenes. The language is relatively simple and easy to comprehend, but the extra descriptions make the novel difficult to fully understand. Most of the characters in the novel are completely unrealistic, which makes it difficult for the reader to relate to what is going on. The character of Lucie Manette, is portrayed as the perfect women with absolutely no flaws. Her character is the supposed epitome for women, but in truth, is highly improbable. Throughout the novel, Dickens' does a great job at keeping the story dry and unentertaining, giving little to no excitement to cause the reader to want to continue. Despite these countless imperfections, Dickens' does manage to be partially successful in his quest to portray the revolution.  	The book, with all its shortcomings, did reveal to the reader, the atrocities that occurred during the French Revolution, and the events that led to it. The abuse of the nobles, and the radical ideas of the revolutionists are all shown in many parts of the novel. The one other aspect that Dickens got right in his novel was the character of Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton is the only character in the story that many readers can relate too and understand a variation of what Carton feels. Carton is a lawyer who feels that everything he has done in his life has been wrong and believes that he can do no good in life. This characteristic is common among people, and Dickens manages to capture that aspect of humanity precisely.   	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, is a slow moving book with numerous flaws that cause the reader to lose interest fairly often. Dickens' overuse of description and unrealistic characters add to the book's dryness. However, Dickens does capture a time in history with great accuracy. This is a book for a reader who likes Dickens' overzealous descriptions and enjoys slow moving stories. 
 I am a wife who was cheated on. How pathetic that there is a book out there to help the other woman. Don't waste money on this book as I will give you advice for free. Ready? Don't date married men you slimeballs 
 If your children play hard with toys......this definitely isn't the toy for them..   It broke the very 1st day! Threw in the garbage 
 I bought this book before a family trip to the Grand Canyon. I thought I had looked around enough at different guide books but I was wrong. This book is fine if your Canyon trip is 100% hiking. Otherwise it is a bit thin and very dry. Not too helpful over all.  There must be something better.  
 Choose your attitude, Play, Make their day and be present.  There I saved you the 2 hours it takes to read this book 
 writes author and "renowned analyst of East Africa, the Horn, Sudan, and the Great Lakes of Africa," Gérard Prunier in his explanation (Pp 155, 156) of why he believes that the situation in Darfur does not qualify as genocide - (because there was not an attempt to "destroy a racially, religiously, or politically predefined group in its entirety,") although he admits that it actually makes no difference how exactly it is defined. His explanation of this one point is clear; however, the rest of the book is extremely difficult to follow due to its concise, complex, research paper-like style. In the first paragraph, he states that the introductory chapter, "...aims at giving...an overview to enable the non-specialist reader to grasp the context in which the crisis developed." That may be the case, but this reader felt only minimally enlightened on the subject of Darfur after having read Chapter 1 (twice), and the remaining five, even having taken notes along the way. Prunier's attempt to explain the situation in Darfur to everyman types is no better than that of Julie Flint and Alex de Waal in their Darfur: A Short History of a Long War - an equally tough read. 
 I bought this book after seeing Mr Florida talk on CSPAN-2. He does have some interesting things to say about creativity, but...  I found it very difficult to finish.  Mr Florida claims to be politically independent, but he doesn't even hesitate to engage in the sort of casual Bush bashing one see's only in the extreme left, and along with this he repeats almost every silly platitude of same, including the ridiculous "pentagon holding a bake sale to buy a bomber" bit.  If he's politically independent, then I'm the King of Siam.  And his solution? right out of the leftists playbook, we have to spend more, lots more, way more than we ever have, "several orders of magnitude more" on "education", "culture" and "the arts."  Anyone interested in buying a used book? Only read once.. 
 BE doesn't live up to the hype?  Whoever wrote that editorial needs to be punished. The court jester doesn't deserve to live.  Not only does BE live up to the hype; BE is the hype.  Common and Kanye reminiscent of Quincy and Michael, the early years.  When Michael was still black and male.  Simply stated, BE flows.  If BE were any tighter we couldn't afford it.  No need to skip or go back. Just enuff songs to make you listen to it again.  Great work of art.  Common and Kanye - damn!!!! 
 To correct a comment in a review on this site - the brilliant, talented Olivia Manning was not a friend of the thoroughly unlikable, secretive Elizabeth David.  Read the book to find out why.  As for David herself, a graphologist summed her up when she was 17 - "she does not shine, she absorbs".  A taker, not a giver in other words, and this book certainly does not contain any examples of her alleged charm 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 I ordered this book, hoping for the correct listed size (19.5 x 12.8 x 2.0 inches). What I got was the SMALLER, nearly one third the price, version! When I sent it back for a replacement, stating that is was the incorrect size, they sent me the EXACT SAME book, in return. I did't very much enjoy having to send this incorrectly sized book back to them, not once, but TWICE! I would suggest that anyone wishing to purchase this great book, do so with caution. If you do, measure it to be sure it is the correct size. Oterwise, you can order the LESS expensive, smaller verion, and get the same exact same book while saving money. Good luck, and I hope this review helps you 
 Take advice from somebody who is able to easily win over others easily.  The advice and beliefs shown in this book are just wrong.  If you want to do really well.  Do what others that are doing well are doing.  Adopt the beliefs, mannerisms, attitude,  techniques, ideas  of who you wish to be like  and you'll get the same results.  in other words.  Don't copy John Gray.  
 The Professional Edition appears to be missing any information on at least 2 new Photoshop CS2 features; Smart Sharpening and Reduce Noise. It has sections on Sharpening and Noise BUT does not cover the new CS2 commands. I have not been through the whole book but this situation took me by surprise 
 Music doesn't get any nastier than CRUNK JUICE. One of the most unusual tracks, a Rick Rubin collaboration, samples Slayer instrumentals with Jon and his East Side Boyz (who are never actually identified on the CD) screaming over them to create what may be the first-ever crunk/blues/metal hybrid in the history of rock & roll. Other songs interweave middle-eastern rhythms, soulful vocal arrangements, vivid call-and-response energy, ADD-poster-child screeching, and occasional delicate strings over Miami bass lines, electronica, and punk-rock ambiance. Chris Rock provides filthy-but-funny spoken-word cameos; Usher, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, R. Kelly, and Lil John protï¿½gï¿½ Lil Scrappy comprise only a partial list of featured helpers.  It's a testament to CRUNK JUICE'S musical integrity that the album holds up despite lyrics that, in addition to being extremely vulgar, are not especially brilliant--or even funny. What seems like it ought to sound like an immature mish-mosh of styles and performers holds together instrumentally as a terrific dance record. If only the lyrics were in a language no one could understand, we'd really have something wonderful here.   I really don't see what people get out of someone screaming the same words over and over again. Is this really what rap music has become today? Come on! 
 This bible is not the true GOD'S Word. It has been changed too much. I believe that the KJV is the true Bible. God died for our sins. He shed his blood so that we might have everlasting life - but, ONLY if we belive. This bible is written to make you feel good about yourself. All we are sinners destined for hell and damnation. God was not brought into this world just to make us feel good about ourselves but to make us feel a need to repent from our sin. We cannot get to heaven in eternity unless we believe in the LORD JESUS CHRIST 
 My mother got me books every Christmas when I was growing up to encourage me to read more. She got me this novel 1 year because of the title (I'm the baby of our family) but I just didn't get it? The story was just odd but to each its own. 
 Essentially this book, with its large fonts and generous helpings of superfluous pictures, contained scant information about the modeling industry.  The pages are just filled with very shallow and unsubstantiated statements such as, "Your agent will navigate your career, setting in motion a business and promotional plan geared to market fully your unique looks and talent", with no further elaboration.  Take for example its chapter on "Ethinic Modeling".  It glazes over the subject on how its such a promising area of the industry and tops it off with two short interviews with 2 female black models - 7 pages in all, with plenty of pictures might I add.  The interviews themselves were just as disappointing with superficial statements of little substance that only glamorizes the modelling industry. Above all, the author insults the reader's intelligence by shamelessly pitching the Wilhelmina modeling agency almost every other page.  In fact, the entire book's message boils down to - try to sign up with an model agency (no less the Wilhelmina) and expect a 20% commission rate.  Those who have rated this book 5 stars are obviously the author or Wilhemlmina employees 
 If I were editing the book I would have told the author I want it to look like this: 10 pages on the idea of the weather channel and how it got to cable, 5 page pictoral of hot weather channel chicks, 12 pages on big storms the network has covered, 2 pages on how much of a weeny Paul Goodloe is and 230 pages on Jim Cantore. Folks, Jim Cantore IS the weather channel. He is on the edge of your seat entertainment that dares weather to take him on. Whether he is chasing after ann F-5 tornado with a paddle to stop it, surfing the waves of a cat 5 hurricane or reporting from a blizzard in a speedo, Cantore takes the worst mother nature has to offer and laughs at it. Yes, there are some other strong anchors at TWC like Sharon Resultan, Dr. Paul Kocin and Dr. Steve Lyons, but they are cluttered up by goofs like Goodloe and Bob Stokes. Stephanie Abrams is pretty hot. Cantore needs to pull a Sting and just leave the weather channel. If there were a cable channel just called Cantore that featured Jim going to places with the most horrible weather in the world, I would watch 24/7. I do realize Cantore can't do 24 hours worth of shows, but he would have to give his approval for any show on the network. If it gets Cantore approval, it's must see TV. This book missed out on a chance to tell the legend's story, but it does mention him so it's a good read 
 Having heard so much about how this woman was the queen of conservatives I decided to give her books a try. However after reading this, I will say, if this is how conservatives are then I feel ashamed to call myself one. She touts on and on in the book about money, and how its every mans right to it yet no mention of how greed is one of the seven deadly sins. she goes on and on about how ALL liberals lie and how they insult each other. A many conservatives and liberals alike have lied however I see her being hypocritical (As well as childish) as she throws petty insults around in this book non stop.  she speaks of how horrible people who choose abortion are and yet when people seeking an abortion see conservatives they see people trowing bombs at doctors and protesters yelling insults, not a gentle person to turn to for support and alternatives. No wonder they don't look our way for help! All the souls I have encountered and helped in this area are not people "just looking for birth control" but people who are confused, made a mistake (though jesus forgives our sins most cannot forgive themselves) and are in need of some guidance.  Whats worse is she puts everything as a generalization of the whole entire section. ALL liberals, EVERYONE. No type of people are ALL the same, no matter what term you may group them under, and this just shows more of her predjuidcice to spread hate. ALL liberals are not the same and good thing ALL conservativies are not the same as her.  Sharing your wealth and helping the poor is just as important as personal behavior. To turn  your back on the hungry is just as much a sin as anything you might do.  Luke 12:33. "Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves purses which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, nor moth destroys."  What ever happened to "thou shalt not kill"  Jesus chose non-violence, even as people threw stones at him he did not lash back, he did not return the stones, or attack others. Jesus said "love thy neighbor" he did not say for oyu to judge and hate your neighbor, God will do that as each soul reaches the pearly gates.  I don't know where this woman gets her blind sighted views but they seem more damaging then helpful. This woman is only spouting hate and making a bad name for us, I'm sure God will judge her fairly and she won't like where she is going. Until then I suggest you save your money on a better book. 
 Yea I agree, these are the artists that give hiphop a bad name, if you could even call these guys artists. This album is strictly made for clubs, and for BET and MTV watchers and mainstream listeners. This is radio music, and stuff you would hear in the clubs. Thats all this music is good for. It has no creativity. The production on this album isnt bad, but lyrics, come on, you cant call these lyrics. I suggest you pass this album up unless your a mainstream listener. No top 5 for this album 
 I really wanted to like this book, but it was so long-winded and unfocused.  I felt that I was being pulled through the dark forest of the author's mind rather than the concrete experience of other people's pain.  If she had written this as a journal it would have made more sense-maybe 
 I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.  I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away 
 "A skepticism towards all meta-narratives" according to... Jacques Derrida, I think...  This is about all the elaboration that is done on the subject of what post-modernism IS.  With regards to what a meta-narrative is, it apparently refers to a fully general philosophical theory, concerning (e.g.) all knowledge-claims; all justificatory strategies; all moral values, rights, and obligations; all instances of injustice;      Apparently this 'theory' differs from nihilism, but if that is what defines it, I don't see how.             If you actually want to learn about post-modernism, this is not a book I could recommend; internet resources have been much more useful.  The section on modern art history and the crisis of expression was interesting, as well as some other random factoids that apparently relate to post-modernism.  On the whole though, I'd say this is a work totally devoid of substance, and and as I learn more I'm inclined to assign the same description to post-modernism itself.  For a similar, comical, and much more scathing review, see the one below entitled "Trash" by 'a reader' 
 I've never seen a book start off so great and end so poorly.  The first half of this book was excellent, especially the way he captured being a 20-something in New York City.  Once he went to Ecuador, however, it was worse than the fiction of a middle schooler writing a class assignment.  To me it felt like the part in New York was non-fiction based on the authors' actual life; when he went to Ecuador, however, it was obvious it was stricly fiction and the author's imagination was not up to par with his experience.  The twist was absolutely predictable, the ending pointless.  The only point seemed to be that the answer to life lays in psychodelic drugs, but to me its as if the author took so many drugs he convinced himself he had something important to say.  Or maybe this does capture our generation - baked and talentless 
 I find this book very hard to read. All of this information is available at the Apple web site. I bought this book hoping that it will easier than what I found online. But this is pretty much a hard-copy of the unfriendly  online version. Apple *REALLY* needs to work on creating usable  documentation if they want developers to use their software. The software  on the CD-ROM is worthless. In short - dont waste your money. Hopefully  somebody will write a more-readable text. I wish I could return this book  for a full-refund :-(( 
 Do not purchase this ebook!  You can't print it.  AND it uses some sort .NET internet validation that stopped working on the laptop I downloaded it on.  So, I CAN'T print it and I CAN'T read it.  For GOD'S SAKE SOMEBODY TELL ME  - WHAT GOOD IS THIS LOAD OF E-BOOK!  Unreal.  Absolutely unreal 
 James Lee was a student of Bruce Lee, therefore the errors in his forms are understandable. If you want to get a rough idea of what Wing Chun looks like, then get this, but I wouldn't recommend that you learn from it. Wing Chun cannot be learned from books

 Before I get started with my review i must say one thing. Im not just a mindless hater, trying to bash a fanatical fanbase of the legendary superman franchise. I liked the original movies, with the real superman christopher reeves and the real lex luthor gene hackman. with that being said here is why i really didn't like this movie.  i felt it was too long and drawn out. Too much time was spent on Lousi lane crying and complaining about superman not saying goodbye before he left. she whined to her reporter friend, she whined to her husband, she whined to clark kent, she whined to her boss, and finally she whined to superman in another overly long melopdramitic flying scene. essentially making this movie a quasi chick flick/comic flick. and although the soundtrack was stunning at times, too much time was past just showing different scenery and background environments while letting the music play. yes atmoshere is great in movies but enough is enough.  basically im saying this movie was 90% melodrama and atmoshperic mumbo and 10% action.   and although the action scenes where pretty cool, it is nothing we haven't seen before in a superman flick, or any other super hero flick.   acting wise, i think the guy playing superman did a pretty good job, nothing compaired to reeves, but im not going to complain about that too much, he was servicable. and noone can complain about kevin spacey, he is just awesome, although i dont think he had the charisma that hackman has as lex. did not like louis lane. too whiney.  story wise, this movie didnt really make much sense. it was way too out there. i mean yeah its a fantasy story and you have to use your imagination but i mean come on. lex luthor is going to basically destroy over half of the worlds population by creating the new continent and people are just going to go "yeah lets move there" and lex is going to make lots of money. not likely. i mean it would take years among years to make that crytallic and dark damp place to be somewhat livable. i dont think that lex would really be the type to want to put years of planning and prep to make this work. i mean most criminals want their power NOW, instant gratification. maybe im being overly harsh on a fantasy storyline, i just think they could have thought of something better, and more feasable.  this movie was alright, it would have been helped a lot if they trimed about 30 minutes of melodrama away. and no i am not saying more action and less character development in movies, cause character developement is one of the most important aspects in the success of a truly great movie. however whiny crying does not constitute as strong character development in my book 
 a very bad cd where the the new music of the stooges I believe I am back in 1969 Nothing new Only bad stuff from the first till the last number The can do better,  Why did they noet do it? There is more than 90 years of music with these 3 guys Regards, John Grootema 
 I dont take neither stance on Religion nor Science with these comments.  I have read the book and I have to admit that it was marketed and was presented brilliantly. It has one goal... Sell, sell, sell.  If you are after useful, quality, informative, knowledge to gain... well you wont find it here. Im so shocked to even see that when you check the back cover of the book it actually says "non-fiction".  The author is a talented story teller...... add a few statistics here and there, a dash of scientific key figures, mix it with life's controversial unsolved mysteries, a few more dash of historic events and famous people, add and link a few references here and there, and WALA!!!! you have a best seller.  Isnt that ironic! it is a "New York Times number 1 best seller"  It was an interesting read though. 
 I like travel books that have a sense of adventure, and where one identifies with the writer. This failed on both acounts, and after struggling through half of it a I threw it away. 
 Don't get me wrong, I'm all for music that is a departure from mainstream junk. Crispy Ambulance employs basic chords and driving beats that have the potential for being good songs but they just dont have the ability to pull it off. The most obvious downside is the horrible vocals. Let's be serious folks, if you're out of key 90% of the time, your music is going to sound like crap. This is one garage band that should have stayed in the garage 
 I had a winter baby and I can't begin to imagine what I would have done without this item.  I have personally inspired 2 other new moms to purchase this already as well.  The absolute best thing is that you never have to put a coat on the child.  And what a time-saver that is if you are a woman on-the-go like myself.     I was excited that right before I had my baby girl they came out with the new Limited version.  I have the Diva color for my little and I get a lot of compliments on the look and ease of use.  I disagree with others who thought it was difficult to adjust the item around the harness straps and that it was cheaply made.  I installed the sack and made the adjustment one-time.  The material allows weather and some liquids to just roll right off the fabric.      I would consider this a must for any first-time moms (as I was) on their registry.  The price definitely a lot higher than I would like to see it, but still a must if you can afford to make the purchase.  
 I'm surprised this travesty is still in print.  "Not in McLuhan's style" is a kind understatement; Powers demonstrates flagrant misunderstanding and confusion of basic McLuhanesque ideas.  Try 'Laws of  Media' or 'Understanding Electric Language' instead 
 I began this book expecting to agree with much of it but was very disappointed.  The author is ranting instead of calmly stating a realistic argument.  If I understood correctly, she believes that the Wedding Industrial Complex (with some vague notions of society and government) CAUSES women to desire marriage, view themselves as princesses and then spend as much money as possible on the wedding. Although her argument is far-reaching her facts are extremely narrow- (she spends a chunk of the book repeating herself with magazine advertising statistics). If her point was to let us know that many business owners within the wedding industry do not operate out of good will but are in fact out to make as much money as possible, point taken.  But I knew that before I read the book 
 This Was Joe Walsh in his Prime, when he was really Rockin' If your A james Gang fan, and you like live music, you really should own this "CD"!  (Joe at some of his best!!!) 
 As a graduate student Of Montessori education at Xavier University, I have had to read MANY books by and about Maria Montessori. Lillard's book is the worst of them. It oversimplifies the Montessori Method and is incorrect in its information. Her books are so inaccurate, we are not to use them as a reference in any paper we write. Many people like to use her books to get an understanding of the Montessori Method because they are so easy to read. However, if you want accurate information, read a book by Maria Montessori. True, her books are difficult to read, but it is worth it for anyone who wants to REALLY learn about her method 
 I normally do not want to say anything negative about an opinionated book, because, to me, it is okey for a book to be biased with conservative political agendas. But it is entirely unacceptable when a book intentionally distorts facts and smears the reputation of many leading academics. David Horowitz's book falls into the latter category. Let me use just one example. While Horowitz is ranting against zoologist David Barash (Univ. of Washington), who, Horowitz claims, has no credential to write a book about peace. One has to ask: What is the credential to write such a book? Must peace be studied only by certain professionals narrowly trained in political science? Remember, when the United States and the Soviet Union were locked in the all-out nuclear arms race, mathematicians such as John von Neumann made a great strategic contribution to prevent the doomsday scenario from becoming reality for Americans. If Barash is discredited for being a zoologist originally, can we discredit Newton as a mathematician just because he was a physicist? Can we discredit Goethe as a biologist just because he was a poet? Can we discredit Da Vinci as an achieved scientist/inventor because he was a painter? There have been just too many learned people who are successful in several disciplines. Barash, as an expert in zoology, has been working on cooperation from an evolutionary perspective. His personal dedication to world peace by seeking a new solution from the angle of game theory is particularly admirable. His new book about game theory is a solid piece of evidence demonstrating that he is more than qualified to write a book about peace. If such a person is considered to be dangerous, who is safe? Horowitz simply does not have an open mind. 
 I agree with many reviewers here that the book is great, but poorly organized and put too much on statistical methods. I have read through it from cover to cover for my exams.  Nevertheless, the first part discussion is very good, but you need to read other books before reading Rothman's book. Acutally, I really hate Greenland's writing, it is too obscure. I would not recommend this book to students 
 This book has been the most difficult book I have every used.  I have found more useful information from atlas.asp.net then in this book.  Almost every example that I used has had either old syntax errors or just plain syntax errors.  In spending so much time finding the errors, I feel the book should be called "Where's Atlas" 
 Ok, first things first, FALL OUT BOY IS NOT PUNK! Fall out boy is emo. Not punk. Punk Is black flag, agent orange...but NOT fall out boy! Their songs are bad, mostly about how their girlfriends wont sleep with them and they can not play their instroments at all. Listen to the bassist!  Think twice about buying this horrible CD!  Thank you for your time 
 Q (Larry Cohen, 1982)  I have very fond memories of seeing this as a teen, and rented it for the purpose of giving it another look though older eyes. Unfortunately, to say Q hasn't aged well is being quite kind.  Quetzalcoatl, the title character, is a very large bird/serpent who's flying around New York eating people who find themselves in high places. At least, he might be Quetzalcoatl (an Aztec god). Or he might just be a big mutant. No one knows. More to the point, no one seems to be overly surprised that there is a large flying serpent picking off New Yorkers. The cops assigned to the case, Shepard (David Carradine) and Powell (Richard Roundtree), certainly take things in stride. The Commissioner (Malachy McCourt, Frank's brother) is the only one who expresses any sort of normal reaction to the events-- disbelief.  While the big bird and the cops are the meat of the story, its actual core is Jimmy Quinn (a young Michael Moriarty), a small-time crook who's run afoul of some tough characters through no real fault of his own. Jimmy's odd relationship with the monster could have turned this into a wonderful psychological thriller, and there are glimmers of that sort of thing, but the script never follows through. Q has more the feel of a quickie monster flick-- none of the storylines is explored much beyond the surface, the special effects are alarmingly (and hysterically) low-budget, and the characters, were they to stand still, could often substitute for props.   But, hey, it's got a big flying lizard. That's something. * 
 A very nice read, with much feeling for the atmosphere of the period. However, Stephen Koch has written a book halfway between fiction and non-fiction, and it is too often unclear where fact ends and fantasy begins. In many cases historical facts are presented incorrect. This is especially problematic where negative qualifications of (at the time) living persons are given without a shade of proof. A small example, is his qualification of Joris Ivens's Dutch cameraman John Fernhout (in the USA known as filmmaker John Ferno) as a 'Comintern-apparatchik' (page 62). On the basis of the available archive material in the Netherlands and the USA there is no reason whatsoever to assume that Fernhout had anything to do with the Comintern. Never in any research about Dutch persons and their connections with the Comintern or Soviet-services did Fernhouts name turn up. He is mainly remembered as, well, Ivens's cameraman, and as the filmmaker in the household of Crownprinces Juliana of Holland during her exile in Canada in Woldwar II. In Stephen Kochs book, Fernhout is just one of many people who are called Comintern agents rather rashly.  The main matter I would like to adress is Stephen Kochs verdict on Dutch filmmaker Joris Ivens, who is one of the main characters in his book. The author says Ivens was a 'Comintern agent' and 'Comintern apparatchik'. It is fair to admit that Ivens's position was a lot more complicated than that of others. Stephen Koch writes himself that his judgement on Ivens is based on my book 'Living Dangerously. A Biography of Joris Ivens'. But I never used the term 'Comintern agent'.  There is no doubt about the fact that Ivens was a member of the Dutch communist party at the time, and that in the thirties he was in almost permanent contact about his filmwork with communist and Comintern organisations. Unfortunately Stephen Koch does not define what a Comintern agent is, but I would suggest that such an agent was at least 1) Not free to do what he liked. Defecting or disobedient agents were liquidated or called back to Moscow and never heard of again.  2) He would have some serious secret mission.  I have called Ivens a freelance communist. In my view he was one even as a partymember. He was completely loyal to party politics, but nevertheless remained largely independent at an organisational level. The relationship between Ivens and Comintern organisations was one of consultation between two parties rather than one of giving or receiving orders. An obvious exception was his work at Meshrabpom Studios in Moscow - a studio that was part of the Comintern apparatus - where he was an employee before he went to the United States.  As for the secrets, in Spain Ernest Hemingway was fully aware of the fact that Ivens was a card carrying communist. John Dos Passos knew that he was an unconditional admirer of the Soviet Union well before they departed for Europe (Ivens's views were apparent even from his public speeches in the USA). It was clear from the beginning that Joris Ivens would be the director of their film 'Spanish Earth' and would thus have a decisive say.   The secret mission from Moscow that Stephen Koch suggests is: Ivens came to destroy the literary avant-garde of which John Dos Passos was considered the main representative in the US. For this reason Ivens was supposed to stir up contradictions between Hemingway and Dos Passos. This theory is a red line through Stephen Kochs book, but in my view this is mere speculation and hardly realistic. Such a plot would have been contrary to communist policies of the time: every Western artist, modern or old-fashioned, was hailed by the communists as long as he or she sympathized with practical communist policy. In general I don't believe in, and see no proof for, the suggestion that Ivens's doings connected to Hemingway and Dos Passos were concocted on forehand since 1936 or even earlier.           
 I respect the message of "The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce" but it seems rather odd to call the ramifications of divorce "unexpected."  Those of us who have been through the hell of divorce know full well the problems our children face as a result.  Staying together for the children is one of the most damaging concepts of all times.  The author knows this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a little bit. I know many people who have divorced and not one was due to not being ecstatically happy all the time.  They fell apart due to abuse, infidelity, and just plain incompatibility.  What I feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and cared for by their parents.  When you have two parents who both love and share in the lives of the kids, most hardly notice whether or not they live in the same house. When you have a parent who refuses to makes the children a priority, who constantly disappoints, hurts, and replaces the kids, there will be damage, no getting away from it.  However, is it better for this type of parent to have daily access to the kids, seemingly with the other parent's approval?  I hardly think so and will challenge anyone who differs in opinion. It is impossible for any of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been better had their parents stayed married.  This is  a major flaw in  the research.  I didn't see any statistics for custody or parental involvement which makes a huge difference. I don't think divorce is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens, you have a responsibility to make your children a priority and alleviate their fears.  When you put your own personal interests ahead of the kid's, whether it's divorce or starting a new life afterward, kids will suffer. I don't like 'studies' like this, they're misleading and potentially damaging. 
 This is a BAD album DO NOT BUY IT. THIS IS NOT REAL MUSIC. Wolf Eyes does not have any real fans; simply a group of followers who like the novelty of it. People who like to show off the fact that they listen to bands like this so people think they are cool. This album has no real tempo or notes just noise, ugly noise, that is not enjoyable to listen to in any way. DO NOT listen to this album. Thank you 
 This should be called the "John Ford tiny collection", as most of his major films are not included. Even "John Ford the early years" would at least alert customers to the fact that this is only a small sampling of Ford's work.  Shame on Amazon for their collaboration in this matter, and for advertising the John Wayne/John Ford collection so closely that it is easy to mistake one for the other. 
 Great premise, great disappointment. Formulaic, improbable, confusing. Ludlam is clearly honing his skills in this early work. He ended a different book than he started. Bottom line: keep shopping 
 This may be a bit of spoiler but I was completly dissappointed in the end of this book/trilogy.  I could not understand how she was going to wrap up so many story lines in last few pages of the book and then I learned.  I felt I was reading the end of a story witten by a parent trying to rush their children to bed.  After three books I had invested a great deal of time into these characters and story lines.  To wrap them up so hasty, with such outragouse coincidence and neatness did not do justice to what otherwise was a very thoughtful series of books.   
 Well as an EQ coach, and someone who studies nonverbal communication, it's interesting - and very illuminating -- that you can take one of the best scripts ever written, and leave the words as is, and come off (in this case) with a decidedly inferior product.  What's fascinating is this is like the undrebelly, the in side, of history.  What it was like for a family.  One thing that's good about the video is the outake and discussion at the end.  But this review is going to be all about - what WERE they thinking?  Who could follow O'Toole and Hepburn.  That's really the bottom line.  I can't imagine anyone present-day doing a better job than Glen Close, but she can't quite, and King Henri doesn't make the cut either. They have no power - as characters or as people.  I agree the sets aren't as good either.  They manage to make some of the lines even sound silly.  The one thing that's marvelous in this version -- FAR better -- is the King of France.  What a fantastic job Jonathan Rhys-Meyers did, and what a gorgeous young man.  Save your money.  See the original.  There's no, NO comparison.  
 I registered for the entire Locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it. I love the theme, but the mobile was a big disappointment. It didn't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available, he just couldn't attach it safely and we ended up returning it. Also, although the mobile matches the theme, I found that the colors weren't very stimulating.  We bought the Tiny Love Symphony In Motion Mobile instead and although the colors didn't match, our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it. 
 This is the first Grafton book I've read, but I'm pretty sure it will be my last.  Simply put, this is the worst book I've read in the past year.  The plot is ridiculous: it centers around the murder of woman who is prostitute/porn star/water treatment plant worker.  The characters only exist as canned responses to the investigator's questions.  Critical clue are revealed in predictable fashion to achieve an utterly anti-climactic ending devoid of any epiphanies or suspense.  
 This book contains an interesting, but never really captivating story. All concepts that make this book worth reading are already present in the first third of the book. Subsequent developments are in line with the story, but I felt little value was added for most of the middle part of the book. Only in the very end, the pace picks up again into a dramatic conclusion.  If the book had been one third the size, I would have enjoyed reading it to the end. Now it just felt like a burden to complete it 
 If you have read other books by this author, you will be sorely disappointed by this one.  The book starts off in good form, and appears to be the beginning of a very interesting adventure.  Unfortunately, after the first 75 pages the story degrades into an all too predictable soap opera of the love story between an older man and a younger woman.    If you want 300 pages of "touchy-feely" romance between a 55 year old dirty minded, extremely horny old geezer and an 18 year old "beautiful, and extremely hot farmers daughter" with lots of: "I love you, do you love me?", "it won't work", "it must work", "we will make it work", "it has not worked before", plus family and friends share "why it will or won't work", etc., then this is the book for you.    There is one fairly exciting part where the old geezer teaches the farmers daughter new uses for her tongue (unfortunately all of the really good details are left out)?  How about having the old geezer assault the local bullies with some bees?  Now that is real excitement!  Do yourself a favor and skip this book and its sequel. 
 I first saw this item on amazon.com but I didn't know what it was then I bought it for halloween. When I was online looking at stuff I read the discription more carfuly and iI figured out that this was my coustume now I'm going to scare the the pants off my little sitters friend. She HATES Darth Vader and I also have the voice changer and she HATES that also. Tonight is halloween and I will scare little kids. My friend is also Darth Vader, and my other friend is the grim reaper. But back to the subject. I really do like this toy it's alot of fun and it's so cool 
 The book, as the title suggests, purports to explain some factors influencing health in terms of chemical principles, such as acid/base balance. However, there are serious errors in the book on the chemical facts that are fundamental. For example, the authors state that oxygen is beneficial because oxygen is alkaline. Outright wrong because molecular oxygen is by no means basic (a better term for ¡°alkaline¡±), or alkaline, in any sense of the acid-base definitions. In other parts of the book they claim ozone is good for health. The fact is that ozone in the breathing air is very harmful to our pulmonary system. Ozone is chemically active and generates radicals to the extent of being toxic in the low concentrations. It is almost criminal to advocate use of ozone generators in the living environment 
 I bought these for my younger than three month old son, he didn't even move around alot and in the morning the fabric that the snaps are attached to would be ripped off from the shirt.  I ended up having to throw them all away or keep sewing them back together.  I do not suggest that anyone buy these 
 This book is written relatively well.  But, as other reviewers points out, if you really want to understand the arguments, then you had better realize Eugenie Scott is a staunch defender evolution and always has been.  In other words, there is no way she could have, and did not, write a balanced treatment of the debate at all.  It's balanced for evolutionists, to be sure, not for anyone else and obviously not for me.  I am still waiting for anyone, anyone at all, to go into enough detail about the fossil record (there are a number of possibilities here) to actually prove that there are enough fossils, that the dating of them was accurate, there was no 'fudging', and many more details about the fossils themselves and the techniques used to analyze them - to show that evolution is a fact.  If, for example, we somehow fossilized 100 different birds that are alive today, some related and some not, I have a feeling that evolution would still be prescribed as the cause for the different species, that different dates would be assigned for each species based on what type of rock it was found (even though it has nothing to do with anything in this case), etc.  The negative reviews of those who critize this book are based purely on emotion.  None of them involve science, which is supposedly what evolution is based on.  If anyone can tell me how specific traits of evolution are testable, such as the 'fact' that life began from inanimate matter, or that species evolved into separate species, I would love to hear it.  Please be specific and let me know how you know based on your five senses, and not that there's a magical theory that explains it, because just as creationism explains everything - so does evolution.  Both are not true.  I am truly amazed that Amazon.com doesn't delete most of the 'reviews' because they are nothing but a bunch of cheap shots at the other side 
 If you know how to read, you're too smart for this book.  Marcy Blum's approach is 1) condescending and 2) geared toward a big-budget crowd.  The CD-ROM is difficult to use and the anecdotes in the text are tired.  I'd suggest buying another dozen roses and saving your money 
 My son was very disappointed when he received this item.  It looks nothing like the picture.  The picture shows a whole container of viewers and you receive one baby blue view with a swirly sticker instead of the eye as in the picture.  I believe this is false advertising, and everyone should be aware of this.  I wanted to give it half a star, but it was not available 
 This movie has been terribly hyped-up, for reasons unbeknownst to me, perhaps politically, I presume, in the usual Hollywood fashion.  It has got to be one of the most slow-moving, boring, uninteresting movies I have had the pain of having to waste my time on ~ while attempting to sit through it.  However, the one and only good thing about it is that Ralph Fiennes is in it ~ but that is all.  Don't waste your money and time on this dud, as I'm sorry I did 
 This is a good book with lots of great information about the incestuous relationship between the Bush family and the Saudi royal family.  The relationship is repugnant, especially in view of the fact that fifteen of the nineteen 9/11/2001 hijackers were Saudi nationals; in light of the apparent White House managed flights that helped some 140 bin Laden and Saudi royals to escape the U.S. only days after the murderous attacks on American soil.     Quite honestly, I wonder why an otherwise intelligent man like Craig Unger would receive and prominently display an endorsement from an extremist-bigot like Michael Moore on the front cover of his book.  Why not include on the cover other luminary Jew-haters and Israel-haters such as Jimmy Carter, Kofi Annan, Cindy Sheehan, John Dingell and Cynthia McKinney?  Unger indicates no personal Jew-hatred or anti-Semitic tendencies in his book.  Why then did he resort to a bigot like Michael Moore for an endorsement 
 This is a yuppie magazine for people with endless bank accounts and nothing to do with their money.  What's more is I didn't see a thing that had anything to do with actual gardens! 
 In 1964 when this movie came out in the theaters the reviews it got were not good.  I was 14 at the time and remember my mother reading about it in the newspaper, and the headline for this movie was "Paris When It Fizzles."  There was little chemistry between Hepburn and Holden.  When I finally saw the movie.  They were right.  I simply like both actors, mainly because I liked them in "Sabrina" but, like the critics said; it fizzled 
 For a thorough understanding of the Mid-East and the Bible, read "Whose Land? Whose Promise?" by Gary Burge, PhD, professor of New Testament at Wheaton College.  Forget the hype and disinformation and find out the facts 
       The Italian-American author John Fante, who was raised in Colorado, wrote novels such as Ask the Dust (recently made into a film) that chronicled the discrimination he felt in the Anglo world, and how he externalized his self-consciousness by assailing the next convenient target--who in Dust happened to be a Mexican barmaid. Tom Tancredo, an  Italian-American congressman from Colorado, also externalizes his self-consciousness in an Anglo world--except that for him conscience does not get in the way of out-bigoting the bigot.  It is easy to imagine Trancredo thinking "We were discriminated against--now it's our turn to discriminate."     Then again, the rabid right-winger Tancredo may only be cognizant of the times when he discriminated against blacks and Hispanics. It may come as a surprise to him, but this country has a long and sordid history when comes to immigration policy--particularly in regard to of "inferior races" that need not discount the notion of race even within the white one.  During World War I, army recruits were given tests that allegedly measured intelligence. These tests were suspect for many reasons even then, since the results suggested a mental age in the top range as 13. That did not stop these tests from influencing public policy, however. The scores of so-called "Alpines" and "Mediterraneans" scores placed them in the main in the "moron" category. Although Italian,  Slavic and Semitic immigrants were largely recent arrivals whose grasp of the English language and American cultural idiosyncrasies was of a lesser quality than native born citizens,  researchers who examined these results chose to champion "innate inferiority" theories in line with their prejudices.     This "innate inferiority" was the principle variable in the backlash against "racially inferior" immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and cutting to a dribble immigration over the next 20 years--that included the years of Holocaust. But there was still the  assumption that "inferior" Mediteraneans (like Tancredo) already here were so mentally incompetent that it was unlikely that they could ever successfully assimilate or contribute anything positive to the body politic. This of course has been proved false by time (although it is difficult to tell if Tancredo is the standard). As we now see, many in this country are even less inclined to give "Mexicans" and "Third World" immigrants the same "benefit" of the doubt.      Illegal immigration should be curtailed, but for Tancredo, like all nativists, the dynamics of cross-border migration in tandem with the need for migratory labor in this country is vastly more complex than he is intellectually (as opposed to politically) capable of discerning. The only thing Tancredo and his conspirators in hate contribute to the discussion is racism and ignorance, as the Southern Poverty Law Center recently revealed.  Tancredo's recently addressed  an outfit called the League of the South, a thinly disguised white supremacist organization; he appeared to be "confused" when serenaded with "Dixie" and surrounded by various Confederate trappings. His utter cluelessness as to the company he was attracting was further demonstrated by his lack of knowledge of the import of the pamphlets he was given later from the Conservative Citizens Council, another defacto white supremacist group.       It is clear that white supremacists have been allowed the "hijack" the debate for their own purposes. Tom Tancredo, for his part, has forgotten the old adage "To forget the past is to repeat it."  
 it works, but it takes a long time to really trim it down.  very low power, made of plastic.  i don't recommend this product 
 First of all, I did not exactly 'read' this biography. Instead I purchased the CD version which I distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work (I have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way, and still been able to read many more technology related books).  I had great expectations from this book, having recently enjoyed three biographies of Lincoln. I have to confess that I was sorely disapointed. I found the research of Mr McCullough to lack the kind of details that I have enjoyed in biographies from Walter Isaacson, Richard Carwardine, or Doris Goodwin. I do not seek a beautiful story in a biography, but rather a reliable source of facts that I can use to form my own opinion of a character. In this context, I find Mr McCullough's use of superlatives or long emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the subject matter of John Adams and his contribution to America. I also enjoy direct quotes from letters, speaches, autobiographies, as they help me refine my impressions of the context (the period, the relationships to contemporary characters, ...) surounding a promonent figure. Usage of the English language in politics has dramatically evolved since Mr Adams' time, and I missed 'hearing' the voice of John Adams. Instead, this biography felt like reading a translation where the personality of the translator overshadows the personality of the original author. Finally, having read other biographies of the founding fathers, I was disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship between Adams and Franklin.  All in all, my lasting impression is that Mr McCullough did a great job at bringing John Adams and the early American Revolution to the masses through a very appealling product that may however leave readers asking for more historical details and less emotional opinions. Had I known that, I might have passed on this biography and instead explore Mr McCullough's fictional work 
 I was attracted to this book because I was turning 50 and finding it unexpectedly disturbing.  The book was interesting enough but not very useful.  I didn't really find out anything I didn't already know - other than there were a lot more women out there who were going through, or had been through, a similar re-evaluation. So while it was vaguely comforting, it wasn't at all inspiring or particuarly helpful.  I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone who hasn't had a traditional married-with-kids-plus-career lifestyle 
 1. Knobs fell off within a few weeks.  Nice appearance but very cheaply made. 2.  Replacement knobs are on backorder for 4 weeks, apparently, it happens alot.  I don't expect the new knobs to last very long either if it's the same design. 3.  The on/off switch is connected to the timer.  When cooking is done, the timer should "ding".  But when I switch it from on to off, it shouldn't ding also! 4.  The on/off light indicator is impossible to see unless you're in pitch darkness.   Seems like a hazard to me. 5.  Other than that, it works..so far.  It does have a nice Stainless Steel look however 
 Good Little book. Thought it was for the larger one. Good read just not what I wanted 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 sum up in two words: too wordy. this novel, like her 'a place of execution', is way too wordy. ms. mcdermid may have come up with some good ideas of murder mysteries, but her writing style is nothing but dragging the text as long as possible. as female writer, she unconsciously put herself as the heroine, fiona, to do some explanation of her relationship with her friend, kit, the crime writer. there are too many pages spent on lot of unimportant blah, blah, blah. too many trivial tidbits throwing around page after page making the reading very very tiresome like reading textbooks. the characters she created in her novels never achieved any up close and personal feelings although many many pages being spent on describing and portraying her characters' personal feelings. i've lost interest and patience in trying to keep focus, to force myself read along, but after repeatedly formatted patterns of the murderers' diaries/records/documentation(?) whatever, the crime scenes reports on the net, newspapers...i have to give it up in the middle and decided to flip it thru and yet still failed to finish it. some interested concepts but panned out too long and too wordy. there are simply too many shadows to be killed, but in the long run, nothing matters 
 I was a big, big fan of the original RiftWar series and the Empire series co-authored with Janny Wurts, so I thought I'd check out what Feist had written recently. I now wish I hadn't. To be blunt, I was disgusted by this book and couldn't finish it. The writing is good enough, but the whole atmosphere is nasty.   The whole book reads like a long S&M fantasy. Talon is a hopeless character who is constantly used and bullied by the people around him, the supposed "good people" in the world. He doesn't stand up to them, rather he seems to think it is his place to be put down and humiliated.  I was particularly revolted to see Pug, a character I had grown quite fond of in previous books, acting so cruel and callous.    I do not recommend this book to anyone 
 I was very disapointed with the book. Expanded third edition was deceiving because I thought it was new - my oversight.  The book is out of date - I oversee a Center that teaches sex education and this was not helpful 
 This is your standard, generic, run-of-the mill comedy, with Ben Stiller doing his usual pratfalls etc. and Jennifer Anniston doing her best to look as unattractive as possible.  Stiller marries some woman, they go to some tropical island for their honeymoon, he catches her having sex with some guy, and he goes back to New York depressed.  Then he meets Polly, and they have absolutely nothing in common.  They go through the usual problems (yawn), then at the end they sort of get together, I guess.  If you'll laugh at absolutely anything, I mean, if you still find knock-knock jokes hilarious, then you may find this amusing.  Truthfully, it's a lousy, unfunny script, these people have absolutely no comedic sense, and the pratfalls and slapstick shenanigans all fall pretty much flat.  There's nothing worse than watching a movie where you're sitting there thinking, "oh, that was supposed to be funny", and not laughing.  Do you find it hilarious that a fat guy falls down on a freshly waxed floor, even though he obviously didn't slip or anything?  Do you find it amusing when someone speaks in a really, REALLY thick accent so you can barely understand him?  Are you left in stitches when someone asks their looney best friend to do a serious business presentation for them, and they act like a complete loon?  I mean, come on.  This crap was old when they were doing it on the Carol Burnett Show 30 years ago.   Anyhow, if you're completely satisfied just watching whatever lightweight, brainless fluff happens to be rolling across your television screen at any particular moment in time, then you'll probably be no more or less satisfied with this than anything else. It's probably better than reruns on the Cooking Channel, but only by the slimmest of margins 
 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. There was absolutely no plot. Nothing. It was a complete waste of my time and taught me nothing about the Cuban experience in NYC. I love most Cuban movies, and all movies by this director. But, el Super was horrible 
 i like this boot and everything but the thing i dont like about it is that, the heel is too high and when i walk, all my weight is on my front bottom of my foot, and it hurts like hell. i cant really walk in them too. i have only wore these boots three times. and i bought them over a month ago. well i was going to returned them but i decided not to wait for the my money back so i kept them 
 I read exactly three chapters and gave up in disgust.  Sensationalized & poorly written.  This book is headed to the swap table at the dump.    If you are looking for a well written account of what nursing is really like, read "Life Support: Three Nurses on the Front Lines" by Suzanne Gordo 
 I received my Curious perfume not last christmas, but the christmas before.. and i was SO excited, i had already been through the shops at least 15 times just trying it on over and over, using every tester i could find. when i got it, i was just as happy and used it just *so* carefully, i wanted it to last for years.  i got the one that comes with the pump, the largest bottle.... anyway,  i now look over to my dresser and see it sitting there. YELLOW. my curious perfume WENT YELLOW and apparently mine was not the only one that went bright yellow, my brothers girlfriends is also a lovely urine coloured yellow.  it also grew a sticky coat of curious smelling...crud.. around the bottle and just today i went over to it, only to find it LEAKING all over my table... i squeeze the pump and it is rock hard... i look over to the nozzle and it is covered in a thick crust, the whole thing has crusted over and is leaking, i squeezed it again and  my curious perfume  splerted out.. it now smells off and doesn't really look all that fantastic as you may have guessed. i am DISGUSTED and so  so angry that perfume i wanted so bad and was so excited to get now sits on the table surrounded by it's own disgusting pool of crust and leaking hardened perfume (i didn't even know that was possible)  i am disgusted what a cheap nasty NASTY product. do NOT buy it unless you think you're going to use it within a period of 1 year.  good work! a product as cheap and nasty as the person endorsing it 
 This book's premise is great, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first 75 pages.  We meet the two main characters and learn interesting things about their lives.  Arlette is the 'book doctor,' and the query letters that are interspersed with the action are very entertaining.  I loved reading about this side of publishing...  Then I hit the wall.  Too much discussion in the text about feelings, nothing more than feelings...I started skimming.  The dialogue started disappearing.  The query letters sent to Arlette all started sounding the same, as though the author had lost her ability to change voice.  I gave up at page 130, regretfully.  I stopped caring about the characters, but I wanted to like the book more and couldn't 
 My mil bought this book for me for Christmas because we have always respected Dr. Dobson.  I was shocked at this book.  I have been an educator for over 20 years and raised 3 children and these "tips" infuriated me.  There maybe some good advice hidden in there somewhere, but I was unable to continue to read because I was so aggrevated at all the suggestions to whip and inflict pain on your child.    To the reviewer who stated that they had been spanking their child since it was 3 months old, you need to re-read the book.  Dr. Dobson himself does not recommend spanking until at least age 15 months and then very sparingly.  An infant does not understand a spanking.  No wonder she is so quiet, she is scared of getting hit.  What you are doing is child abuse.  That being said, I am not anti-spanking.  I have spanked my own children.  But this book says to use a switch or belt.  It also endorses squeezing a child's neck to inflict pain.  And as the reviewer who was spanking their three month old proves, any endorsement of spanking can and will be used by ignorant people who will site it as a green light to beat and/or abuse their children.    This is not Christian behaviour.  The golden rule says "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you".  I wouldn't want someone hitting me with a switch.  His methods might get your child to obey you, but not out of respect, only out of fear.  I certainly don't want my kids to fear me.  Do not buy this book 
 Due to lack of space, and in need of activity I have decided to buy a mini stepped to increase my daily phsycial activity. This one I bought from a retail market and the reason for me to choose particularly this one was the price (of course), the flexbands with counter.  Very limited documentation, it doesn't tell you actually how you can adjust the difficulty levet, I figured out a better way after two weeks by experimenting the device.   And then it sarted to make craking noises. So I used some olive oil on the joints that passed. Then The suspensions got air inside and at the very begging of the step it started to make a crack noise which I couldn't evade at all.  While experirmenting the device, the electronic part got loose, it was attached with a soo thin cable, one touch and the cable was torn off. OK I said that was my fault, I shouldn't have touched it.  But...  Today, the `steel` cable that holds the pedals got apart. That is so suprizing, I am only 80 kg, and using it usually every two days for 30 minutes... Very bad construction.  Ok... Why I gave 2 stars? The flexicables worked really well.  That deserves a point.  
 I am not going to write what this phone does and what it doesn't, you will read it from other reviews. I will explain what problems I had and you might  have with it. At least it might help you to troubleshoot the similar issues. First, it was easy to setup the phone, connect it to the router and phone line, register your skype name and make your first land line call. Quality is good. Then I placed a skype call to a friend and ..first problem: no audio, nobody hears anything. I tried to use another skype account on my computer to make calls to/from sph200d and ..no audio.  I looked at all settings on the device, support website and found nothing. I tried to connect to the admin webpage using provided on the CD documentation username and password admin and admin and couldn't connect(second problem). Well, I reset a base unit and still couldn't connect to the admin page. I searched online and God bless internet found that documentation on CD is old and current username/password is admin/password. And what even better reseting a base unit have helped with audio problems! Hooray! Now I can make good quality skype calls without need to go downstairs to my computer.  The next and biggest problem I've experienced is no matter that automatic sign in option is turned on the phone(and the web page) is asking the password every time you sign off/sign in the skype. Turning phone off, reseting base/phone, using different skype id, etc did not help. I called support, waited 15 minutes and was told I need to register the product online first. Well it has sense, I did so and called again. 10 minutes later customer representative from Deli was ready to provide me with an excellent service. First, he said yes automatic sign in should work and my phone is not defective, and asked me to do all steps I did already, i.e. reseting, etc. No luck. Then he left to check about this issue and called me back to state that phone MUST ask for a password every time I sign in for a security reason! (what about remember username/password option there?). Nice lie to a customer to make him believe problem is solved.  Note: if you turn the phone off - yes there is an option to turn it off, please press and hold red button - without signing off, then when you turn the phone on it wouldn't ask you for a password. Right, but all this time that phone is off, friends see your status as online/away and may try to call you.  Well, there is a solution I've found for myself - never sign off, just change your status to offline. I have not decided yet whether to return/replace the unit or keep it. Maybe when you learn tricks on how to use a device it would serve you well. But at current price/quality I would not recommend it, too bad there is not many alternatives.Good luck with it 
 This 1987 thriller focuses on Norman Johnson, a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes.  As the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the US Navy.  Johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the South Pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft.  He was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration, an assignment that Johnson would just as soon forget.  Once the team is taken to the Navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft Johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances - that the Navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology, labels and directions are even written in English, leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is.  The suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile.  This novel is quite predictable, just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby, that the undersea environment will become threatening, there will be many deaths, there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on.  While there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment, Crichton is capable of so much more.  If you are a fan read it but be forewarned, if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this.  
 Just for everyone's information -- and my own ego -- although I am listed as the author of both the first and second editions of this book, and I did write the first edition, the second edition was produced without my participation. I take NO responsibility for the second edition. I am currently updating the book, and a third edition, written in the style of the first edition, will be available soon.  Jo Lynn Southar 
 The timer looks nice, and the setting ring is indeed made of nice heavy cast metal.  But the way that you set it is STUPID:  you start by twisting the ring.  This wakes it up, and makes the HOUR numbers start flashing.  Now you can set the HOURS.  But how many times do you want to set a kitchen timer for more than an hour?  To get to the minutes, you have wait five seconds for the SECONDS numbers to start flashing.  NOW you can set it.  Just as stupid:  when you hit the RESET button, instead of resetting the timer back to whatever you originally set it to, it sets it to ZERO.  So now you get the pleasure of going through the whole setting process again.  You'd think it would be hard to goof up the user interface to something as simple as a kitchen timer.  But they've succeeded, to the point where they need to print two paragraphs of instructions on the bottom.  Get something else 
 Besides pretty much knowing the ending shortly after the beginning, the movie is just dumb. The characters for the most part are flat, the twists are unbelievable, and everything in the story lacks any reality. The incredibly high tech bank is run on a rack of pc equipment, but somehow is now run remotely and all of the maintenance terminals are missing. As if the full rack of gear needs some green screens in order to work. Sorry. Then of course the hackers need to do a home invasion in order to get physical access to the system. Hmm. And then they take several days, only to stumble when the maintenance terminals are missing. So, in a flash of brilliance Harrison Ford rips out the scanning bar from an all in one printer and plugs it into an ipod. And then tapes it to the screen so that they can capture the screen output. Because everyone knows most people like to watch numbers scroll on the screen and there is no such thing as cat or pipes. But, if you believe you can pull some stuff out of a printer and click it into your ipod and suddenly have a portable text capture device, well i guess the rest of it makes sense. but then, the wireless video cameras all had fisheye lenses. which makes sense because there is a wireless toy car that takes all of them out temporarily, since it obviously uses the same frequency. which we know because in the beginning of the movie it causes huge interference on a computer screen. since after all, most computer screens connect to the pcs using a wireless transmitter. that cable you plug in the back is really just an antenna. and you will believe that only bad guys get hurt when automatic weapons spray buildings and older computer guys can beat the crud out of younger armed psychopathic criminals with british accents. And that there is great wireless coverage throughout the empty areas of washington state, so that you can drive in a car with your laptop and have constant internet access.   so, what was there to like in the movie? hmm. it was consistent. nothing made much sense from the start to the end. oh, and one of the computer guys looked like he actually could be a computer guy. but of course he was killed for being nice. or in the way. or whatever.  watch bladerunner for the 15th time instead. 
 As a developer with no prior JavaScript experience, I've been very disappointed with this book. In the Introduction section, the author says "Some experience with JavaScript might also be useful, but it is by no means critical" (Page VIII) which isn't true.  Throughout the book, the author will keep assuming (implicitly) that you already have a good programming background (he uses a more complex logic in his code),and will leave many things unexplained or explained too late. This alone will easily guarantee frustration. NO BOOK EVER frustrated me that much.  Another issue is that the book uses some very complicated examples with complex logic. Unlike other decent coding books, instead of starting with simple functional examples and developing them\it as you read a chapter, the author uses one big example and "tries" to explain it part by part throughout the chapter. This might force you to "memorize" the script(s) since they contain too much code to understand (which is not the point). To make sure if the examples of the book suit you or not, download the free sample chapters from Sitepoint.com and check the "table highlight" example at the end of chapter 3. That's how most of the examples will be presented. (with more code of course)  Now don't get me wrong, the topics covered in this book are great, but it seems that the only people who will really appreciate it are those who already have a good background in JavaScript (logic,functions,methods...etc) NOT beginners like myself. So if you're trying to learn JavaScript\DOM, then go find a better book (such as "DOM scripting") 
 No. No, no, no, no, no. Well, maybe. At the library, this book was in the Young Adult section. I suppose it should be moved to the children's section, because as I read it, I felt like a child learning to read. The style was rather bland, and much like the stories I used to write when I was in the fifth grade. The style was the first thing to turn me away, as well as several cop-outs in the writing.   Cop-outs how? Well, it wasn't very realistic. At all. While yes, most teens are overly dramatic, their parents and teachers aren't. It didn't seem realistic that a parent would leave once a child came out of the closet, rather than kicking him out. It didn't seem realistic that the parents ALL became so easily adjusted to it. It WAS realistic that some of the teens were so naive, but it didn't help at all. Things went exactly as the characters wanted them to, and it wasn't that interesting. It was rather obvious how everything was going to happen; when one character said they wanted something to happen at a certain place and time, it happened. There were hardly any obstacles, and the background characters were all really, really fake.  The plot to me, seemed a bit dry as well. Overall, the book didn't impress me. Yes, it may be aimed towards younger people, but hey, I AM a younger person. I wasn't impressed, however. Others may have been, but it just wasn't happening for me.  Hey, the guys on the cover are sorta cute. Sorta 
 I really like Thomas Moore's books but this one was definitely not one of his best. I found it very boring and it was kinda one of those books that just made no sense at all. I found it hard to continue to read the whole book even tho I did... 
 How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction.  I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said. I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books.  At least the movies keep your interest 
 I'll be honest: From the trailer, commercials, and the very fact that it contained both Ben Stiller and Jack Black, I was expecting at least something stupid enough that it was funny.  Despite the horrible reviews when it was released, I still somewhat eagerly went to see "Envy".  Halfway through the movie I almost left, but forced myself to stay, hoping that it would get at least a little better.  To say the least: It didn't.  I left the theater depressed and regretfull over the 7 bucks I paid for the ticket, and the hour and a half lost seeing it.  This movie is easily one of the worst comedies I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of comedies.  Bed Stiller's performance couldn't be more disappointing, and Jack Black stupid antics weren't funny in the least.  Honestly, I think there was MAYBE one time in the entire length of the film that I chuckled, and that was forced.  Nothing in this movie was funny, just dull and boring, plus the plot is bull, and doesn't end up anywhere else from where it started.   If you're looking for something stupid but funny as hell, this is NOT it.  "Envy" is a total waste of time, with the only humorous thing being the time and money the producers put into this load of s**t.  Don't believe anyone who promotes this movie, though I haven't met anyone who has (Heck, most of my friends who saw this movie didn't even finish it)  Trust me, if you buy this movie, or even rent it, you will pay dearly.  Keep the money: You could buy a pizza (A much better investment).  
 I have mixed feelings about this quasi-romance novel about an American teacher named Hope and Po-yu (Paul), her Chinese student. On one hand, it was often very interesting, as Ms. Liu gives a lot of historical detail about San Francisco and China. On the other hand, the characters were rather shallow. I didn't find Hope, who oddly resembled a whiny yuppie of the present day, particularly appealing. Po-yu was far more interesting, and was portrayed with some complexity and depth. The romance between Hope and Po-yu rang false for me. ("Honey, I first fell in love with you when I realized it was required for the plot to progress!") I still can't see what attracted them to each other. Also, did anyone else notice that any slight against Hope is recorded with meticulous detail (the rampant racism against Chinese at that time seems glossed over in comparison although it is mentioned), but Ms. Liu has some pretty crude stereotypes in this novel: a hearty blonde Swede, a drunk, surly Irishwoman, and Hope's one-sided-ly disagreeable mother-in-law to name a few. Also, she takes some pretty cheap shots at two groups it is still politically correct to demonize: all the Britons in the book are "right-o, jolly-good" bigots, and all the Christians are consistently hypocritical, or stupid, or both. In addition, much of the middle of the book is bogged down in political discussions that try so hard to be interesting that they're just the opposite. And to top it all off, the ending was forced. This novel could have been so much better: as this book is based on the lives of her grandparents, she obviously had some fascinating material to work with. And one more quibble: one of Hope and Po-yu's daughters is named Jennifer Pearl. In 1908 the name Jennifer pretty much existed in only one place in the world: Cornwall, UK 
 I use "The Notebook" and "A Walk to Remember" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.  After a slow start with "True Believer," I was more satisfied with "The Rescue."  Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,  
 Bigoted and racist title for a book about talented blacks, their deserving of a more honorable title since they were called these racist nicknames all their lives and had to be these stereotypes to show their talent, but he can get away with naming a book as he has this one because he's Black, I'm sure if a white did the same, the NAACP will jump on him. Bogle suppose to lift Blacks up not put them down.  Here's a long but informative review! Naturally since Bogle is the only one writing about early Black film stars people believe everything he says. He plays it safe by always talking about the same ole' stars that he talked about in his last books. Never does he introduce the public to unsung talents we never heard of. He spends most of the time talking about how mulatto, how light or how dark such and such is and how such and such couldn't do this or that because of this or that. When whites write on their stars they don't write about how blonde, how brunette or how red head someone was and how Irish or Italian one looked. Which proves how stuck on skin color Blacks really are! Why do Blacks feel they always have to spend time talking about race instead of giving these stars their recognition and due, forgetting how they look and telling of their life and versatile careers, who they really were, where they come from, making one reading feel like they knew the person all their lives, make one feel the happiness and sadness. Bogle spends more time on what they didn't do then what they did do. Which is sad, the public is missing out on a lot. So again, do for yourself the research and don't' depend on others all the time.  Bogle loves talking about how white Fredi Washington looked instead of writing about her extensive, incredible career, she done more in her life then most of us could dream about it, she didn't let others prejudices hold her back. She was no tragic mulatto, another stupid name, minus well call Stepin Fetchit a tragic ni**er which he wasn't, he was the first black millionaire and no more of a stereotype then Black pimps, gangsters of today who are getting rich off of it like Step got rich off of his stereotype. Fredi will be the first to say she had a great life and career. She wasn't sad or confused but a strong black woman. Bogle is no better than a white writer who puts down a black but thinks its okay to coin a book Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies and Bucks because he's black, I'm sure if a white titled a book that we be yelling racism, don't Black talents deserve a better title?   Bogle also plays it safe by always talking about Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge, never telling the stories and never giving recognition to other black actresses like Nina Mae McKinney, Mildred Washington, Theresa Harris, Fredi Washington, Edna Mae Harris, Florence O'Brien, Louise Franklin, Daisy Bufford, Jeni LeGon Evelyn Preer, Suzette Harbin, Hilda Simms, Francine Everett, Shirley Haven and countless of others who had a chance to display their talents on the screen in Hollywood and helped fight discrimination and  help in the enhancement and betterment of blacks on screen but he gives all the credit to Horne and Dandridge, who didn't do as much as others if you want to get down to the truth, but I'm glad he don't talk about them in a way because he'll butcher up their life stories, I'll give them their due though. Many aren't remembered because maybe they didn't do as much, who cares about who has done more, were suppose to be remembering them for accomplishments and talents, right? White film historians sure remember all their stars, little or big. Someone like Louise Brooks, considered a early Hollywood icon is highly regarded as a great actress despite she only had a few good films and wasnt a big movie star. The woman is more remembered for one good film and a bobbed hairstyle but white historians will make sure you know her, her achievements and what she DID DO for the film industry.  Why can't Bogle be like that instead of criticizing everyone and judging them by white people's standards of what success and beauty is? I guess it's true that you gotta work twice as hard as whites to be someone in this world, whites can be remembered for little things, few successes, Blacks gotta have many successes to get rememberance and recognition even for other Blacks to remember them. Bogle is one of the few black film historians, you would think he would write more positively of blacks in Hollywood but he treats many worse then whites treated them when they were alive. Bogle never mentions Willie Covan and Marie Bryant (and appeared in movies also and was a good friend of Lena Horne's too) who choreograhed many white stars, they were behind the scenes but contributed to Hollywood. He suppose to be giving credit not taking away. Either Bogle is too lazy or likes to show favoritism because he sure won't tell other unsung talents stories. If he does he clutter it up with talking about their looks especially if he doesn't know how to write about them. Bogle knows nothing about the great career of Nina Mae McKinney, the first movie star of Hollywood and Europe, who done more films then any other black actress of her time, the first to appear on many magazines, she had so many achievements, yet he gives her one little page, if you don't know about a person, I rather you not write about them at all then to write lies. He never talks about the Black Cinema independent movie stars or the industry who was apart of American cinema, I guess their too hard for him to research, so he takes the easy path in writing about stars he already wrote about a million times. He never writes about Ethel Moses, Francine Everett, Dorothy Van Engle, Edna Mae Harris, Margaret Whitten, Tomiwitta Moore, Bee Freeman, Lorenzo Tucker, Monte Hawley, Ralph Cooper (created the first black studio in Hollywood), Oscar Micheaux, Spencer Williams and countless other black movie stars who appeared in films for blacks made by blacks in the 30's and 40's, I guess that's too mediocre for him but they done more for the enhancement of Blacks in movies by creating their own images, own roles, own portrayals, playing people from all walks of life unlike ones in Hollywood who were stuck playing the same types of roles and being the same images he always complaining about well I feel give due to ones who at least tried to do for themselves and become what they wanted but see they weren't cross-overs so their looked at as non-important by some which kind of dictated by whites who we should remembered and who's important. It's hard researching Black Cinema stars but boy it's worth it plus studying them, watching them perform gives you a good idea of who they were even if you can't find info on them. I still find the time to give them due and I'm no professional or anything but Bogle is a high class guy who only likes to write about Hollywood and his favorite gals Horne and Dandridge.   Ive done more research on unsung, forgotten stars then he has and it has been pleasurable teaching others on the net about blacks who contributed to stage and screen, stars who were just as important as Dandridge and Horne. I'm glad there are other people who are taking it upon themselves to tell the true stories of many unsung black legends and don't write in the same fashion as Bogle. Anyone who is hung up on skin color and don't want to think outside the box and like to hear the same stories then Bogle is for you but someone like me who researched many early black stars of stage and screen on my own and found out the real deal, found how they really were, found how they were really looked at, and found the true stories wouldn't appreciate Bogle's work much. I've talked with some legendary Blacks of the early years, some of their relatives also and they gave a completely different view then how Bogle describes them which shows he just goes by hearsay and documents and don't do accurate interviewing and researching.  I would think Bogle would spend more time on talking about the beauty of  black women from dark to light and  their wonderful achievements to the world.  Black women are quite unique but instead Bogle tells the  story of black women from white people's perspective it seems, he tells how black women were looked at from whites perspective not from a true black person's perspective that has pride for his race, maybe Bogle has a white person's way of thinking who is partial. Because I would commend these women, embrace and make the world embrace their beauty, courage, and talents; their many gifts to the world isn't as nearly written about as their skin tones are. He loves spending time writing about how light, dark or mulatto someone looks. Again, he makes it seem like such and such suffered because she was mulatto, light or dark, come on man, if she had a tragic life it was her own fault if she suffered. He makes it seem like color and race was the problem for everything which is false, actually many of these women profited from the race sometimes and plus women in general face discrimination, no matter what race or color. Don't you think these women went through enough being judged by skin tone or looks, they wished in their life for being to judge their talent, at least give them that now, Bogle doesn't. Who isn't discriminated against in this world? Bogle makes it look like Black is a curse when these female performers change the world and introduce the world to their greatness and the greatness of the race. He loves talking about whether someone should of passed for white or not like when he's talking about the great Fredi Washington. He misses out on showcasing  other great talents like Valaida Snow, Blanche Calloway, Una Mae Carlisle, Eunice Wilson, Adelaide  Hall and  others but that's okay because they have  been written  beautifully about by other writers. Well, many are dead so they cant stick up for themselves and Bogle takes advantage of that, he hasn't even interviewed or actually talked to ones who he writes about, he just goes by hearsay. Have your favorites but when you write a book, you can't show favoritism which he does all through which hurts others who has a story to tell but he only give honor to his faves. It seems no black can make him happy, he always has something to criticize. In his words every Black woman is a tragic, confused mulatto and every black man is a coon, or some other stereotype, he wouldn't say that to the young black guys or gals in entertainment today though, he takes advantage of the dead who can't stick  up for themselves.  There is a website on unsung black talents of stage and screen, you all will enjoy. http://www.angelfire.com/jazz/ninamaemckinney/ 
 This is one of the three books I commented for a book review assignment of a Korean history class, taught by a very very renowned professor on Korean history. I got an A/A- for the review. My professor especially argeed with my comments for Triplett's book. As I disagree with the previous reviews on Amazon(which is the reason I chose to read this book. a big waste of time, sadly), I want to leave my review here for future reader's reference.    Rogue State: How a Nuclear North Korea Threatens America, although written by a former chief Republican counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee William Triplett II, is overall a disappointing book. Triplett accuses North Korea of proliferating weapons, supporting terrorism, producing and selling drugs, abusing human rights, and kidnapping females to be sex slaves. Although Triplett provides many detailed allegations and facts, he does not give credible and unbiased sources for many of his allegations, which greatly weakens his claim. Moreover, he presents North Korea as the most dangerous state in the world. He also accuses China for planning behind it and supporting it militarily, economically, and politically for almost sixty years, with a hidden intension to use North Korea as a "borrowed knife to kill other people." (p. 9) Contrary to what is suggested in his title, Triplett does not spend much analysis on North Korea nuclear crisis itself, but just the potential outcomes if everything goes as he argues. He also fails to give any constructive recommendations, only predicting that issues on North Korea, and nuclear weapons in particular, will not progress unless the U.S. define the issue not as "North Korea" but as "communist China and North Korea." (p. 12) Yet America already tried to involve China in solving the North Korea nuclear crisis.  Triplett borrows the phrase "killing with a borrowed knife" from a Chinese military classic the 36 Stratagems. He presents this strategy as if it is a secret doctrine of the Chinese people. According to him, it means "to use covertly another country to annihilate your enemy." (p. 9) However, he apparently does not fully understand the meaning of this phrase. Triplett says that to make the stratagem work, it has to be disguised, by keeping your opponent from learning vital information (denial) and misleading him about your true intentions (deception). He therefore argues that China and North Korea have been adopting a strategy of denial and deception, trying to hide their malicious aggressive intensions. (p. 10) However, his interpretation of this stratagem is completely wrong. It is true that to make this stratagem work, one has to disguise his intentions. Yet the disguise is not only for the opponent, but more importantly, for the one you "borrowed the knife" from. The point of this strategy is to deceive someone, make him fight against your opponent, and let that person bear all the costs. That China and North Korea indeed made some secret agreement, as Triplett suggests, goes directly against this strategy.  Therefore, Triplett cannot reach the point that China and North Korea have been using denial and deception by just claiming that they try to "kill with a borrowed knife."   Triplett goes on to spend about a quarter of the book on a history of the role Stalin's Soviet Union and Mao's Red China played during the Korean War, to demonstrate their close connection with North Korea. Triplett gives a list of records of the Soviet's and China's involvement in North Korea (p. 9), without providing any source for his allegation. This puts the reader in doubts about the credibility and impartiality of his claim. For example, Triplett writes that "Moscow and Beijing helped Kim start the Korean War; Beijing intervened to block a United National victory in the war." (p. 9) However, the question of who started the Korean War, North or South, is still debatable. In a more impartial view, Bruce Cumings thinks that it is wrong to ask who started the war, since both North and South Korea were at fault. (Cumings, Korea's Place in the Sun. p. 263) Cumings argue that the United Nation's decision to enter the war against North Korea was solely based on American and South Korean sources and was likely to be biased. (Cumings. p. 263) Thus, accusing China of haveing blocked a United Nation's victory without providing enough background information could mislead the reader. In another allegation, Triplett claims that "communist China helped Pyongyang to start the Korean War." (p. 73) This accusation is apparently false. At that time, China saw conquering Taiwan as its priority and did not want the Korean War to divert its energy. It did not support the idea of the Korean War, and did not help North Korea in the war until very late, actually too late in a military strategy perspective.  To demonstrate that the Soviet Union, China, and North Korea produced "a series of decisions that initiated a reign of terror over millions of people in the Far East and established the framework for East Asia today," Triplett claims that Stalin, Mao, and Kim decided in a communist summit in late 1949 to let Kim conquer South Korea, Mao conquer Tibet and Taiwan, and Ho Chi Minh conquer Indochina, and attack the Japanese Communist Party. (p. 21) However, Triplett again fails to credit any source for this important decision. What's more, as we can see after more than half a century, none of these goals materialized except for China's takeover of Tibet. Many of these aims were even never attempted, let alone attempted but failed. Therefore, even if Stalin, Mao and Kim did make a secret agreement, with only one goal achieved, I wonder whether China and North Korea indeed have the ability to initiate a reign of terror and put billions of lives in danger, as Triplett claims.   Triplett claims that China supports North Korea and is to blame for making North Korea so dangerous. However, Triplett fails to make it clear what China's intension and incentive to support North Korea is. This is crucial to how the non-communist world should respond. China may not have malicious aims to support North Korea. It could have done it partly because of Mao's romanticism to help his communist friend in the 50's. And once the support started, it would be hard to stop. China might also support North Korea to increase its own influence in international politics but without the aim to use North Korea to dominate the world. Such intensions are perfectly justified. The U.S. is also supporting various countries and regions around the world in order to have a stake in regional politics, such as Taiwan, Japan, and Israeli. Another possibility may be that China sees the trend in North Korea towards terrorism and instability. Fearing a neighboring country getting into trouble and the spillover that would ensue, China may be trying to prevent a social and political crisis in North Korea by providing support. Triplett fail to analyze any these possibilities. In fact, China should be one of the countries that want to see North Korea to become a terrorist state the least, unless it can fully control Kim Jong Il, which Triplett fails to prove either. Triplett provides another piece of evidence against his accusation of China's involvement himself. To prove the danger of North Korea, he says that it turned to income from producing and selling drugs, after China cut its support to fund its own economic development. Regardless of the amount of support China has provided North Korea, how could we assume that China is the evil planner behind North Korea right now, after China already cut its support?   The weakest point of Triplett's book, in my point of view, is that after making so many unaccredited and rather controversial claims, he fails to go anywhere significant in his analysis. He does not really examine the implications of the nuclear tensions after 2002. He argues that there is no simple military solution to a nuclear North Korea. To solve the North Korean problem, the U.S. has to define the problem not as North Korea, but as communist China and North Korea. (p. 12)  Although Triplett claims that the Bush administration are blind to the role of communist China, what I have shown is that China has always played an important role in negotiating with the North Koreans. And it is not the case that the U.S. has not tried to make China influence North Korea more. If China has tried all it can, Triplett's conclusion does not help the problem. If China tried to hide its influence on North Korea, then what can America do even if it re-defines the problem? If it wants China to move, there will be a price to pay. This is a known rule of the game of international politics. Triplett's suggestion is incomplete without a recommendation on how to employ China into the negotiation at a reasonable price.   To be sure, Triplett does provide many examples and tries to prove the connection between China and North Korea from an historical perspective. However, because he fails to give references for many important examples, the creditability and impartiality of his book, and consequently his conclusion, is in question.  Readers with more knowledge about Korean history could easily give alternative explanations of his examples that do not lead to his conclusion. Besides, his conclusion does not contribute much to the situation right now. Given Triplett's role in the U.S. government, this book is important and valuable in another sense--it more or less indicates one U.S. governmental official's perspective on North Korea, a dangerously prejudiced perspecitve.   (Another minor point, Triplett should have done a better selection and framing of the cases. For example, in a list of prices the non-communist world have paid for North Korea, Triplett parallels the loss of more than 50,000 Americans' lives in the Korean War, to the killing of a high school girl singing in a chorus in the same shootout that killed the South Korean first lady. (p. 7) No matter how cruel the killing of an innocent high school girl is, it is way less important and significant than the more than the causality of 50,000 Americans in the Korean War. Putting these two on the same list gives rise to doubts about the author's capability. 
 I like Thomas Moore's work, but find him difficult and sometimes impossible to follow.  He rambles about things that are not connected to his subject.  He has much to say but doesn't always say it succinctly.  He floats from idea to idea without any real practical application for daily life, at least for this average Jane.  This is definetly not one of Moore's better works 
 I give this film one star for the acting, which is often very good. However, the plot and message of this film revel in hopelessness, and debase every aspect of lower income, urban people. In all honesty, I've seen more joy in an African famine. I sat through this film, against my better judgement. Still, if you're truly interested in investigating the dark underbelly of urban American misery and frailty, then I recommend "A Streetcar Named Desire", "KIDS", "Last Exit to Brooklyn", and "Traffic". 
 I bought this CD because I've always seen it near the top of lists of the greatest Reggae albums.  I've given it many listens but I'm afraid I just don't get it.  Every song is basically 3 1/2 minutes long and all start to sound the same.  I didn't like this nearly as much as Marley, Tosh, Toots and the Maytalls, Jimmy Cliff, etc.  Even the dub versions disappointed me, being in the same lengths as the vocal versions.  I guess I like my dub a lot more stretched out and adventurous.  I thought this sounded dated, same-y and boring 
 That model costs just a few dollars more and comes with an additional powered hand-held tool, and also a hard-floor cleaning tool, both of which this model lacks. The lack of adaquate tools means that this model is very difficult to use on stairs or for cleaning large hardwood floors 
 I refuse to believe that some apprentice intern ghost writer didn't really write this.  I will try to describe him or her.  Definitely a vegetarian - possibly a member of PETA.  Dry writing style (well, Crighton is dry even when he's excellent).  It bothers me how many unrealistic characters Crichton uses - it seems every character in some of these books earned a PhD from MIT by 16, was an alternate on the olympic swim team, a top researcher, an accomplished pilot, beautiful or handsome, and wealthy.  These people do not exist in nature.  They also have an annoying habit of speaking in complete, complex sentences, quoting research in casual conversation.  But at least MC has a gift for crafting believable, plausible sci-fi - much like Isaac Asimov.  But this is so beneath him, I refuse to accept it 
 Eugene O'Neill may have been the father of American theatre, but the excellent writing he became known for is not portrayed in Long Day's Journey into Night. O'Neill's characters were shallow, pathetic and seemed to have great moodswings.The father-son relationship between James Tyrone and his son, Jamie, is meanspirited, and they tend to blame eachother for the family problems. Tyrone regularly refers to Jamie as a useless failure, and a drunk, not only to his face but to other family members, and in turn Jamie refers to his father as a man who would rather save a dime then save the life of his son, Edmund. Tyrone says such things as "You'd be content to sit back like a lazy lunk and sponge on me for the rest of your life!"(p.32) and comments to Edmund that, "If he's ever had a loftier dream than whores and whiskey, he's never shown it."(p.131). The characters of the parents are pathetic, the mother all fluttery and drugged, and the father as the stereotypical old, cheap, and mean failed celebrity. The only seemingly normal relationship is between Edmund and Jamie as for the most part they exchange brotherly love. The relationships and conversations between the family members seems entirely unnatural, they go from scathingly angry to chipper in a matter of seconds. It is as if they entire family is bipolar.  Long Day's Journey into Night was based on the life of O'Neill himself, with the character of Edmund as O'Neill. The mother of O'Neill was truly a drug addict who had lost the son between O'Neill and his older brother, and his father never accepted O'Neill for who he was. These sad beginnings continued throughout the life of O'Neill and was evident in the writing of this piece. If the characters in Long Day's Journey into Night are closely based on his family members then O'Neill had a more sad life than anyone could possibly imagine 
 Bought it 2 months ago for in-door usage, thought it'd last until the end of the semester. After less than a couple of weeks of normal everyday usage, punctures started to appear, and the patches that came along with the package didn't help much. Even though the design and the built-in manual pump is a big plus, the quality is very disappointing 
 Or maybe use it as a paperweight; gosh knows it's heavy enough.  Let's see...if you can't figure out who the bad guy is by about page 50, you're either asleep or you just ain't tryin'.  Hackneyed characters, implausible situations, convoluted plotting for its own sake...but hey, a couple interesting tidbits about Hess's aborted mission to England (or was ALL THAT made up, too?).  The big plus for this book is that you can easily read it on an airplane flight.  Any airplane flight.  Like Chicago to Tokyo.  Or maybe Chicago to Peoria.  Just depends on how many pages you skip while reading.  As I got "into" the story, I started skipping 3, then 5, then 8-10 pages at a time.  Sometimes whole chapters.  Never lost the "plot" (what?), never missed the "sex scenes" (huh?), might have missed some ridiculous blood and guts (plenty more ahead on page "X+5" - not to worry).  Can't wait to skim his other books 
 Hope Edelman's book is successfully part memoir and part academic study. She has chosen a narrow scope for her research, and that's fine--that is, until she feels the need to dismiss other related topics (such as the equally intimate bond between granddaughters and paternal grandmothers) by claiming that they are just not as significant instead of acknowledging that she simply did not choose to research them. The second hole in Edelman's research comes when she refers to how maternal grandmothers live longer than paternal ones--where the basis for this statement? I'll believe it when I see it. It's absolutely fine for her to choose to focus specifically on mother to mother to daughther generational relationships; what's not fine is for her to casually brush off related relationships as though they just don't matter as much. Within the context of her thesis, they are not as significant, but this is something that Edelman needs to address instead of pretending that she didn't write about them because they are not as significant. Other than these two crucial holes, Edelman's book holds merit in its well-written accounts of family, both from her own life and from her case studies. It's worth a read, not so much for its actual insights, but perhaps for the insight that it inspires its readers to pursue on their own 
 For those readers wanting a survey of modern terrorism and its possible courses of development, this book will suffice.  The New Terrorism presents a well-researched case that the intent of modern terrorists may  increasingly be to simply cause death and damage.  The author's inclusion  of the criminally insane within his definition of terrorism is  simultaneously disputable and thought provoking.  However, the book does a  poor job in thoroughly exploring the concept of WMD terrorism.  This, in  conjunction with organizational problems and some of the author's style  choices, should place this book somewhere other than the top of potential  reader's buy lists.  Jessica Stern provides a far better alternative in her  "Ultimate Terrorists.&quot 
 The VP's wife wrote a Pro-War book and reads it at Christmas time to her grandchildren?  Let's see, we celebrate Christmas as being the birth of Jesus, who's father (GOD) by-the-way, sent down the TEN commandments, one of which is THOU shall not kill. . . .and THIS book is about WAR which , if I'm not mistaken is about killing.  So, what's the connection here?  No wonder kids grow up with so many psychological and moral problems today, because the ADULTS are so messed up!  Way to go Lynne 
 This is a great book for people aspiring to become a professional gunsmith.  It may have some usefulness for the normal gun owner as well.  The detail and comments provided show this book was written by someone with an extreme amount of knowledge and experience in the subject.  Unfortunately the author realizes this and wrote this book to reflect it.  His egotistical lectures of exactly what the reader should do go beyond what I expected to gain from this book.  Then there are the contradictions that lead me to not believe in the author's knowledge as much as I did when I started.   If you want a very technical guide on how to become a professional gunsmith, this is the book for you.  If you want a Do-It-Yourself Gun Repair Manual (Gunsmithing at Home) look elsewhere. 
 The first few reviews are too harsh,I was given this as a gift so I am not as pissed off at the money. I give it two stars could have been three but for the fact that the hero's are way too perfect and they are dull- but it was not a book I expected much from anyway.  The plot also gets way to over the top.  I mean is there any plane or helicopter they cannot learn to fly in a weekend? Hero's invited to the summit by the President! They escape four attempts to kill them before they even get to China! Also hero knew the guy was Chinese just by looking at him for a less than a minute, how many white folks can tell difference among non whites? Why are all the Chinese Americans bad guys as well?   The novel is way to heavy with anit Chinese comments, has lot of what are just rants. See the other points in the publisher weekly review, but after considering them you may want to read the book, if you want to consider what we do if we and china butt heads, but have low expectation and know that in this world the good guys always win. Do not expect much and look for used copy, I paln to look to see if any of his other books get any better reviews before I cut him off. 
 I have to admit that I gave up on this book.  I'm hoping to find a more readable biography of Mrs. Roosevelt.  Cook's style and grammar are just too jumbled for me.    Look in the "look inside this book" section here and go to page 14.  This is a prime example of Cook's overuse of quotes.  I appreciate that she did her research, but if she was going to quote so much, she should have just included one whole article.  As it is, the whole page is a mish-mash of sentances and words taken from various sources creating a confusing unreadable mess.   
 I bought this coffee maker and after only using it 6-10 times over the course of 13 months, it stopped working.  I called the number for service that was listed in the booklet and was told it can't be repaired & I should just throw it away!  I had already purchased nearly 100 pods and now those and the coffee maker are useless!  Buy one at you own risk 
 Black and Blue is the story of a woman who flees an abusive relationship, taking her son and attempting to disappear into residential Florida, all the while waiting for her husband, a New York cop, to find and hurt her. The book is not Quindlen's best and while it is readable, and at less than 400 pages a manageable length, it feels like little more than a Lifetime "woman's" movie in novel form. I wouldn't recommend this book, especially in comparison to Quindlen's other work, although the lessons of what abuse is, how it happens, and how difficult it can be to escape are good ones to learn about, even in a fictional context.  Anna Quindlen is also the author of One True Thing, a book-cum-film about a daughter's experience with her mother's terminal cancer. That book is good--realistic, emotional but not maudlin, and challenging. Black and Blue is merely an example of weak writing that reads like a made-for-TV movie. It made its way into Oprah's book club but would never make it on to  my must-read lists. Facing the realities of abuse is a good lesson to learn, and so the subject is worth reading about, but Quindlen's portrayal is less than realistic or compelling. All of the checklist facts are there: abuse leads to abuse, specifically carried from father to son; some women are drawn to the type of men that are/become abusers; legal protection can be inadequate; violence can lead to death. So on, so forth. The list of facts is there but the emotional context is filmsy, centers on children (rather than personal strength) and strange, powerless situations. Even when she flees her husband, things seem to be done to the protagonist rather than done by her. It's unfulfilling and disappointing to the reader and detracts from the whole text. In fact, the more interesting characters are mere foils and supporting roles like her new friends and romantic interest. They seem to have more personality and depth than the protagonist.  It will take less time and energy, and induce the same emotional responce, to watch any one of the numerous women's TV daytime movies about the same subject. Black and Blue is gripping only because you want to know if her husband will find her or not, and presents very few challenges, either in the writing or the ideas, to the reader. It's readable and I was able to get through it, but it's still a poor example of literature and even of the lesson it attempts to teach. Don't waste your time on this one 
 Although the idea for this book is very good . Instead of staying on the subject and trying to explain to a novice what all this is about it goes on to other things like novelty edges etc which is not the reason I bought the book for. And they don't as usually make good use of the available pages for instance there are great big pictures of the finished project and tiny ones for the steps and very few for these. And then a whole page of a picture of materials which is completely useless like page 22, 86, 84, 72, 66 and of course page 58 which appears twice in this book. Such a waste of pages and photographs.    
 I started the Full series a few years back when I needed an Evanovich fix between Plum books. I loved the first 3, after that I can't say they have lived up to my expectations.  This latest is the worse of all, it reminds of the 180 page romance novels of the early 70's, you know the ones you'd 6 of every month in the mail? Juvenile and unrealistic, sorry Janet but this one is a stinker for those of us used to the great Stephanie Plum novels and even the Barnaby series. Lorelei King does her best, but even a great reader can't help this book 
 This film is a bunch of disjointed skits. Thy try too hard to be campy; however with not enough lead and no finish each disjointed sketch just leaves you wanting. There are a few made-up ersatz songs and Jayne Mansfield's accoutrements; aside from those everything else is flat.  There are a few personalities but they never shine: Phyllis Diller (fully clothed) Brian Donlevy (storms the beach) Jayne Mansfield (always points north) The Wild Ones (People Sure Act Strange)  The introductory song was the best part of the film.   A final thought "Love is a rose, but you better not pick it" 
 There are few books in English about the Bektashi Sufi Order or its most famous American practitioner, the late Baba Rexheb, so I approached this book with great anticipation.  Regrettably, it was a huge disappointment.    Author Frances Trix was for many years a student of Baba Rexheb, and this book promised to be an inside look at the teachings and methods of a modern spiritual master.  Unfortunately, the man and his teachings remain largely a mystery as Trix instead focuses on the phenomenology of the interaction between student and teacher.  We thus find Trix going to great lengths in order to state the obvious, such as that Rexheb sometimes expressed himself with facial expressions or gestures rather than via the spoken word!  Time and again, Trix narrowly focuses on the minutiae of a particular teaching moment, describing everyday verbal and gestural patterns as if they point to something profound or revealing.  The effect is like those old Cotton Dockers commercials where we see the pants up-close, we hear various witty comments from a "bull" session, but we don't know who those people are, we never see their faces, and we ultimately don't give a rip one way or the other.   This is the kind of book that gives scholarship a bad name - dry and pedantic, unable to see the forest for the trees, and draining the life out of a topic which had shown so much promise.  My only hope is that someday, unencumbered by the need to prove her academic bona fides, Trix will write the book that she should have written already, and that Baba Rexheb and his teachings will come alive for those who were not fortunate enough to know him.    
 I couldn't read the whole thing in order to know for sure. It was dry. I didn't get the imagery - I know it's supposed to be a classic, and I really wanted to read the book, I did - but it was long and boring and I just don't get why it's so "classicly popular". Sorry, but it's how I feel. Now, that being said, I read a condensed version of it, and I discovered the story was a little bit interesting - but that's as far as I can go, even with the condensed version - it was only "a little bit" interesting 
 Rather bland and boring; covering overly general neuroscience topics. Many better neuroscience books have been written covering the same material. 
 This 1984 performance looks now a bit faded and old fashioned. It is a pity, because the musical performance is good. The technical quality of the DVD is poor. The picture is not smooth enough, and the sound lacks definition and sheen. English subtitles are available, but it can't be turned off. The 2000 performance on the TDK DVD is definitely preferable. 
 I was on a website reading about the current Mid East happenings (I am working in Kuwait now), and a banner ad talked about Nostradamus and world war 3 starting in 2007. Well I came to Amazon and came across this book, its one of the few that have reader comments on it. Then I read the excerpt : "Whereas prophecies up until this century have claimed that Israel and the Promised Land would be settled seven years prior to the arrival of the Messiah, this book proves that the advent period is, in fact, forty-two years, not seven. This discovery dates the settlement to the end of the Six-Day War in 1967, and indicates that the Messiah will therefore come in the year 2009." Does any of that passage raise an eyebrow? It does for me. Israel was made a country around 1947/8 I thought so where does this writer come up with using 1967? Well there's one explanation that I would believe, IT'S TO SELL A BOOK! Another comment, someone here said the world will be at war if our US leaders have their way, HUH? So our current leaders WANT world war 3? Please take a deep breath and go out of your apartment (maybe find a big park and walk around and look around, you've been cooped up on fringe web sites too long bouncing hate against others and its magnifying inside you). Did you think that the trade center bombing in 1993 was done by people who had a right to do it, and that the 9/11 attacks were a conspiracy by Bush? I really hope that your all talk and don't vote because the leaders you would put in power will probably empower more of this terror upon our western society. As for the book, I'll pass, thanks. 
 First of all I like Vangelis very much. However I have had it with the way that his music is being released. We are consistently given compilation releases (usually of the same tracks that are on other releases). WHAT IS THE POINT????!! All the more frustrating is that Vangelis has a ton of unreleased music that many fans like myself have been after for years. Sorry the bootlegs on Ebay just don't cut it.  Where's an official release of "Cavafy", "The Bounty", "Francesco", and "Bitter Moon". Where is all the still unreleased music from "1492", "Blade Runner", "Antarctica" and "Chariots of fire", yes he released soundtracks for these films but they were sadly lacking.  Unfortunately we will probably have to wait for Vangelis to demise before we ever get these tracks, if even then. 
 First, what's right about this book: There is no question that racism and prejudice in the South Asian community is a serious issue and needs to be addressed. I applaud Prashad for, at the very least, bringing the issue to the forefront. This is the first book I am aware of that attempts to delve into this matter head-on. Prashad is one of the few folks on the far Left to clearly articulate a dynamic view of culture, as opposed to (this is consistent with my own opinion on the nature of culture). In contrast to many multiculturalists who view culture as a static in nature where people are to be pigeon-holed in a racial or ethnic box, Prashad refreshingly describes culture as a fluid concept where individuals have some degree of choosing cultural ideas, themes, practices, rituals, and values. I wish more people of Prashad's ideology would get this. As of now, I have only seen this view expressed well (if at all) by neolibertarians (e.g., various Reason magazine columnists ) and neoconservatives (e.g., Paul Gigot in the Wall Street Journal and Michael Barone in The Weekly Standard). This dynamic view of culture is Prashad's and the book's greatest contribution. Now, what's wrong with this book: The biggest problem I have with Prashad is that he has an extremely pessimistic idea of what America (i.e., the USA) is about. Specifically, he holds the common (if not standard) Leftist perspective that America is a white male-dominated society. Phrases like "racist country" and "white supremacist" pepper his arguments. While I understand this work is a polemic in nature, nevertheless his shrill statements on America as a fundamentally racist nation greatly diminish the value of his arguments on the dynamic nature of culture. His essays (such as those in the progressive magazine "Little India"), express this same, tired view of America, and generally without the benefit of his otherwise keen insights on cultural dynamics. We are expected, in this book, to accept America as a hopelessy white supremacist society (almost a priori) and this for me made the book extremely irritating to read at times. Also, I would agree with an earlier review that there are two (if not more) books within this book. While some of his discussions on Orientalism, "greedy gurus", and Hindutva (i.e., Hindu chauvinism) dovetail with is main points on racism and prejudice, he devotes far too much time and effort to these topics. Indeed, the impression I get is that he is excessively attributing South Asian racism to these factors. It seems he is trying too hard to connect South Asian racism to these themes, and in the process leaves out several issues that have been explored by others as possible factors contributing to South Asian prejudice. Why, for example, didn't he fully address desi (i.e., Indian) cultural attachment to white (a.k.a. "fair") skin? What about intra-South Asian prejudice originating in South Asia itself (which includes caste, religion, language, region, class, etc.)? One of his central arguments of (Hindu) desi Americans using "Yankee Hindutva" as a reaction to "white supremacy" fail to convince me. I believe there is far more to explore beyond orientalism, gurus, and Hindutva to try to explain desi prejudice. Prashad also almost totally ignores other ethnicities and how the play into this new American ethnocultural landscape. I would have greatly appreciate the author's views on the experiences and histories of other Asian Amerians (Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Cambodians, etc.), Hispanics, native Americans, Jews, Italians, Irish, Arabs, Persians, Caribbean blacks, African immigrants, etc. While I'm not saying that Prashad was required to give "equal time" to other groups (he is, after all, writing a book about desis), he seems to focus too much on a desi-white(WASP)-African American triangle and not much else. Specifically, why hasn't he explored desis' views of other minorities, which would more correctly reflect desi patterns of prejudice and racism? Another twist on this is that Prashad could have discussed the experiences of desis across the diaspora, especially in Britain, Malaysia, Singapore, Guyana, Trinidad, Fiji, Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya. The latter 6 countries provide especially vivid desi experiences that point to desis' high degree of endogamy, ethnocultural conservatism, and disproportional economic power as phenomena to be explored. Finally, and this may be my own prejudice as a pragmatic, mild-mannered Midwesterner: I can't help but see Prashad as yet another ivory tower academic pontificating from his ideological bunker in the elite Cambridge-to-Capitol Hill corridor (he's a professor at Trinity College in Connecticut). Maybe it's just me, but his calls for progressive action ring hollow to me and at times it seems as if he's trying to show off his progressive credentials. Also, particularly annoying to me is his reliance on Internet usenet newsgroups to gauge desi sociopolitial thoughts and views. (I'm not sure if he uses newsgroups as an example in this book or in his other essays). A few individuals drawn to the Internet to vent their bigotry does not qualify as a group for serious cultural analyis. These newsgroups are often merely echo chambers of extremism, chauvinism, and hubris. This reliance on newsgroups makes Prashad appear to be an out-of-touch academic who doesn't or won't take the time and effort to take into account the full range of South Asian American cultural experiences. Would it be too much to ask Prashad to spend a few days interviewing desis from a variety of places, such as Edison, NJ (a premier desi commerical and cultural hub), Oak Brook, IL (a high concentration of rich and upwardly-mobile suburban desis), or just about any random motel off an Interstate in the South (where there is high chance you'll find a desis working as anything from housekeepers to managers to wealthy owners)? In short, the book discusses some important and interesting topics, and provides some very useful insights and observations, but ultimately, Prashad's stubborn ideological bent greatly diminishes an otherwise noble effort to pry open the critical cultural phenomenon of desi "success" and prejudice 
 For some strange reason, I began receiving this magazine in the mail. Never ordered. Never paid for. My conclusion based on reading the last three issues: You're kidding me. How can Time Inc. still publish this rag? What's the point 
 Of all the books I have read and discussed, there is one book that we never should trust...when I got this book out from the library I was all geared up for a great read...therefore was greatly disappointed as I read this book.  MacDonald is unfortunately negative about all of The Beatles songs, and in particular has it in for George and Ringo's numbers. I found that he did not have a single positive comment about any of The Beatles songs - no matter who wrote them. It makes one wonder why he wrote a book on them. If you are looking for a book with a positive approach to the Beatles masterpieces, this isn't the book you should be buying. I reccommend "A Day In The Life, the Music and Artistry of The Beatles, by Mark Hertsgaard, instead of MacDonald's sloppy, single-minded musings. This book should be put to shame 
 too slow--this book was not enjoyable.  The story did not flow well 
 The bottom line of what makes a company viable is great customer service after the sale when things don't go as planned. Customer Service exists but their reps claim they can't do anything about your problem. Their manners are less than acceptable. Rude seems to be the "in-thing" at this company. As consumers, we have options; one of which is to ge elsewhere. I am writing them off as a lost cause and taking my monetary loss as a lesson learned. It's too bad 
 A question for anyone who has this dvd pack. I am after a movie my friends and I watched years ago. It was about a lady going out for cigarettes on a wet night and having to stop for petrol on the way home. A killer is running lose as we hear on the news, playing on the car radio.  The petrol attendant worries her in the way he is acting. He tries to get her out of the car but she wont. He attacks the car trying to get her out.  What she does not realise is the killer is in the back of her car and the attendant is only trying to save her...  This short movie was on with 3 other movies one being about a boy being sucked into a video game.  We would greatly appreciate any help finding out the name of the dvd or tape which has these four short stories on it.  We are wondering if they are on this dvd or any of the others listed with amazon.  Thank you. Aussie Girls  
 Does she know anything about Japan's wartime history? Just google "Unit 731," the place where her own daddy probably worked at. Is it a pure coincidence that her daddy lived in the area where these despicable, inhuman experiments took place 
 Much of the information about why aid fails is in fact close to the mark.  What is said of the failure of kleptocracies in Africa is true.  However, it is somewhat irrespinsible that the perspective on this failure solely blames Africans.  As a graduate student studying all of these issues, it is apparent to me that the author doesn't make the connection between the current state of Africa and its past.  Africa is failing today because the slave trade turned African kings and mercenaries into forces that ravaged the interior, turning group against group in wars to sell prisoners to the white man.  Colonization left African nations with extractive economies, no infrastructure, no experience at ruling, and behind a hundred years in political development.  And today most African economies are still completely subject to Western markets and decisions about them. Finally, IMF Bank Structural Adjustment Programs and social austerity programs are largely to blame for enriching kleoptocratic despots, fueling wars, and spending billion on white elephant projects. Also to blame are foreign investment groups and governments who backed dictators and armies useful to their foreign policy.  Yet all of this is ignored.  Caldersi is a good read for understanding corruption, kleptocracy, waste, and hoarding...however, it is one piece of the puzzle and ultimately fails to educate the reader on the whole picture.  I recommend this book, but only in conjunction with a wider reading selection that covers the rest of the picture 
 I had to stop reading because I could not tolerate this novel any longer! I read 280 pages, and just couldn't finish it. Explicit sexual scenes seem to be the norm with Baxter these days. In this pornographic novel, Baxter describes two naked teenage children having sex in public, with adults watching them while pleasuring themselves. He goes into graphic detail. It's disgusting and shameful. Oh...it's all part of the story, and their behavior is just a result of the key plot element.  That's an excuse to explore deviant behavior.  I am shocked that Clarke associated with this rubbish, because it reads nothing like a Clarke novel. For whatever reason, Baxter's publisher managed to get Clarke's name on the book. In my estimation, Clarke wrote or co-wrote the first chapter and that's all, because that was the only good part of the book! (BAIT AND SWITCH!).    I have completely turned 180 degrees from being a fan of Baxtor to absolutely loathing his garbage now. He had a good run early on, but has totally lost it. I loved Ring, The Time Ships, Flux, all the way up to Vacuum Diagrams. This novel, like all of his recent work, suffers from pathetically weak character development (I am so apathetic toward his characters, I can't recall their names). His use of questionable and outdated physics theories, and his obsession with explicit sexual scenes makes this all but intolerable to a true sci-fi fan. I will never read anything from this former author again. 
 I have discovered that Mr. Byock's translation is regrettably bland.  It appears that he translates word-for-word, which gives the English prose a clumsy, "summarizing" kind of a feel.  The translation lacks a beautiful, flowing quality that might emerged had he tried to portray the spirit of the work through his own personal, subjective experience.  Said again, he should have taken personal "ownership" of the story and written it in modern English according to his own inner feeling -- richly imagining the events and meaning, and then writing a faithful, but new story.  Instead, he rather logically translates word-for-word, with seemingly little care for the poetic quality of the tale.  Thus the reading is bulky and unimaginative.   I believe that portraying one's own inner experience of a story is more "valid" than a scientifically-accurate rendering of it.  Although the text is clear, to a fault, I was disappointed with it.  I recommend a different translation. 
 I wish I could understand liberals, I really do. One reviewer here complains about how Bush can't technically be tagged a liar because of his use of generalities. Isn't saying that Bush is "WRONG ABOUT ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING" a generality? I mean, really -- he was wrong to even pardon the Turkey before Thanksgiving? For those without a sense of humor (or your average NPR listener) that was a witticism, what Americans call jokes.   Gosh you get mad when people point out you "hate" America, but isn't this book a testament to that fact? Just to save you some time, I understand that you are now thinking that I am both a nazi who believes "W" is synonymous with "America" and I'm also a McCarthyite who smears anyone who doesn't agree with my "America, right or wrong" mentality. So with that out of the way, only an insane person would believe that Bush isn't desperately concerned with protecting America and defeating REAL religious fanatics that want to do terrible things to YOU before cutting your head off. Whether you agree with his methods is a different story, but if you don't agree with his sentiment than you identify with the enemies of America and therefore can't possibly be patriotic. You are agreeing that it is more important to write a book about hating our president rather than the crazy, WMD-sucking madmen who killed over 3,000 Americans in mere seconds, and would be more than happy to continue doing so.   If you DO agree that Bush is sincere in his desire to protect America than he can't be wrong about everything, and you have somewhat of a social duty to not totally crap on the man most responsible for keeping us free and safe (until Hillary wins in 2008, of course).  If you think the war is a pretext to take over the world, and that Bush has confused national security with world conquest - well, then you have either the option of a pill to cure you, or a cult to embrace you. But even to the girls who earn hard cash a dollar at a time adjacent to a greasy pole you would be considered quite dumb. Let me ask you -- if we were after oil, then why didn't we take it in 1990 with the 1st Gulf War? Isn't that what you said at the time was our reason for going to war then (oh I know it is -- I was in DC at the time and saw the protests on the mall regularly). And if we liberated Iraq to conquer it, why did they have elections with no one named "Smith" or "Johnson" on the ballot? And finally, WHY IS OIL TO DAMN EXPENSIVE TODAY???  Jeez, I WISH we had gone to war for oil, at least I wouldn't have to buy cheaper cigars just so I can keep my SUV topped-off!  All in all, having perused these books, let me just remind you that "HATE" is not a family value, and also that Canada is a lovely, lovely place to live. 
 The book wasn't bad, but I felt was did not include enough variety.  How about detail on putting up flagstone, or putting rock on an existing wood frame house wall...  Still an interesting book and includes some neat info 
 I wanted to like this book. However, I found the writing very droll. I just couldn't feel the emotion, the ideals, the "rapture" of the subject matter. Instead, the book is bogged down in endless and pointless biographical details...this person did this, and then this, and so on. Maybe I'm not giving it the benefit of the doubt, but there are other books on transhumanism I found far more interesting, informative, and readable 
 Listened to the audiobook version of this James Patterson novel in the car -- simply because my spouse bought it off a remainder table cheap and I figured we should get our money's worth.  Twenty minutes into it I wanted to chuck the first tape out the window the writing (and the audiobook narration) was so overwrought.  But then I listened longer as I realized how amusing the bad writing was.  A wonderful text here for a creative writing class:  how to write junk fiction that sells but which you'd never want to put your name on.  Sad that someone can write as poorly as Patterson and sell oh so many books 
 I bought this book for my 4 year old, thinking it would help us to train him to stay dry at night. In actuality, it is for children dealing with the stigma of bedwetting. The book emphasizes how it is OK to wet the bed and OK for Mom to constantly change the sheets and wash the PJs. It was not what I expected...I think it would be good for a child who is having serious psychological damage due to bedwetting, but not for a 4 or 5 year old 
 I had given 5 stars to "Valuation," but I feel that this workbook is practically useless for its price. The problems in this book are not very challenging; they merely require echoed answers instead of questions providing in-depth analysis. Common questions include: "Name three issues in valuating X company" or "Name three reasons why X is preferred over B." These are simple questions one could easily answer by taking copious notes. I had expected much more challenging questions from the workbook, but I was sorely disappointed. My advice: Buy "Valuation" but avoid buying this book 
 Not so sure she is fair about who she rates highly. I went to a few places that were way below average. I do like like some of her sidebars. 
 This book is a nihilistic, incoherent work, and I dare anyone who reads this review to argue to the contrary.  Admiration for this book is humbuggery in action.  The emperor has no clothes 
 Considering the sensational cast (Eli Wallach, Terrence Hill, Bud Spencer, Kevin McCarthy and Brock Peters), the Euro-western era it was made in and the locations where it was shot, Ace High is a major disappointment. The plot is uninvolving and incoherent, the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style, the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever. The editing looks like it was performed with a butcher's knife. After the first ten minutes, I knew I'd made a mistake buying it. A boring 120 minute piece of junk, Ace High is hopelessly outgunned by any number of great Italian westerns including Corbucci's The Mercenary or Parolini's Sabata series. Save your fistful of dollars for a better film 
 This film starts off with great swirling Felliniesque pageantry, with Damian Lewis doing a brilliant perfectly tuned & on-target portrayal of a calm cool feral madman entrepreneur of the 1960s or 1970s, Paul Reynolds, surrounded by a collection of pretentious sycophants whose archetypes range back to the early Roman era. They party & posture amid the grounds of Paul's palatial estate when Lizzie strolls through, straight & serious Lizzie, for whom Paul develops an inexplicable attraction that ultimately leads to his & the film's doom. Lizzie, fresh from secretarial school, is hired by Paul as his personal assistant, although she at no time displays any sign of aptitude for either business or politics. Given the task of organizing Paul's vast collection of notes & papers into some kind of accessibility, she proudly displays her accomplishment: everything's been prettily packaged & shelved into four big color groups, bright cheery boxes with not a label in sight. Apparently she's interpreted her duties to be interior decor.  As played by Jodhi May, Lizzie portions her expressions out in either coy tilted-head smirks that teenage girls give dad when they want $80 for new jeans and violently hysterical outbursts that make you wonder if this all takes place in an alternate universe that knows no psychotherapy.  There are plenty of other problems placing this film in the known world, although it tries hard to represent specific points in time, *eras* as it refers self-consciously to them. There's pot-smoking, group sex & communal living, so is it the 1960s or the 1970s or the 1980s?  Early on, Paul dreamily says to Lizzie, "Computers, you should get into computers, that's where the future is. Women used to prevail in the field of computers but now the guys are taking over." Oh yeah, when was that? Before mainframes or after?  As the film became progressively more choppy & episodic, I felt I was watching a pastiche of "Rosencrantz & Guildenstern are Dead" (sans Shakespeare or Stoppard) as done by Ed Wood, all the real action taking place on an alternate stage/screen.   Vague generalizations substitute for plot movement as grand fluffy pronouncements as made about corporations being hippos & the future of business being in telecommunications & the internet rather than vacuum cleaners. Oh yeah? What heppened to PCs & cell phones?   Too bad. The first 20 minutes at Paul's estate and the ideas driving Friends & Crocodiles along with Damian Lewis's fine performance were really promising. Terrific title, too. But the title's explanation & the rest of the movie are a terrible letdown 
 I bought this book because I've read and enjoyed Wendy Wasserstein's plays and I knew it was her last work. Frankly, I wish she hadn't written it. Like many other reviewers, I was reminded of books like Hollywood Wives in the first half. Parodies of lifestyles of the super-rich, like most chick lit, have about exhausted themselves. Without more, it's like been there, done that. The second half of the book, if anything, was worse. Either someone else finished it for her, or she decided that everything in life was pointless and was going to illustrate that through each of the characters. Since it was difficult to care much what happened to any of these characters in the first place, I skimmed the last few chapters. Satire is the dark side of humor. It should be witty and thought-provoking. This book was just tiresome and hopefully she will be remembered for her other work 
 We have to use this book for the college class that I'm taking and it is a horrible book. I often find myself looking for help on the internet rather than going to this book. It is poorly organized, I have to go to the index in order to find something I specifically need because the book isn't in any order. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Find another there are many more 
 I was all excited after reading about him on-line and I had the impression this would truly be an insightful book.  Well, he talks a lot, most of it common sense. I'm pretty disappointed by it 
 A generation before there was a Left Behind, there was The Late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey and C. C. Carlson. This is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of America. A phemomenal best seller, it was a watershed event in the growing Christian publishing industry. For many Christians, their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future. A generation later, many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of Holy Scripture, sensationalistic attempts to correspond Biblical prophecies to current events, and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated.  So why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism? Well, while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events, it still resounds for much of the Church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by Lindsey and other "prophecy pundits." While it is certainly true that Tim LaHaye has replaced Lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism, it cannot be denied that Left Behind was made possible by this book.  Part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form. For LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, it was the pulp novel. Back in 1970, Lindsay and C. C. Carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic expose. Like most books of this type (e.g., The Bermuda Triangle, Chariots of the Gods?, The Philadelphia Experiment, The Population Bomb), it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts. Like most of these books, it was a peculiar period piece of American life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams. Like most of these books, it is laughable in retrospect.  If the book were out of circulation and I were reviewing this for historical purposes, I would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp. The original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong. After all, it was the 1970's when wild conspiracy theories, distrust of any traditional authority, and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage. When viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age, a UFO invasion, a famine around the corner, and California falling into the Pacific Ocean, the authors' claims of the coming Armageddon look downright trendy.  However, in the intervening years, the revisions of this book just kept piling up. Make a bad prediction? No problem, edit the book with the old gaffes removed, add a few trendier predictions, and release it as a new book. Lindsey, now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years, still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis (Carleton's contribution is more stylistic) despite his failed scenarios. Lindsey's original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s (he even wrote a book The 1980's: Countdown to Armageddon trumpeting this belief). Well that didn't pan out, so he then jumped on the Y2K bandwagon (another of his books was Planet Earth 2000 A.D.: Will Mankind Survive?). Oops, wrong again. First communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is Islam (a more recent book is The Everlasting Hatred: The Roots of Jihad). When one bogeyman falls, he is quick to insert a new one in its place.  Between the failed predictions, the hilarious misreadings of the original languages, the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology, and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the Biblical prophecies "right before our eyes", it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things. This trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs - notably the Left Behind series of novels.  If you can find a copy of the original version from 1970, it can be interesting in much the same way as a Brady Bunch episode - not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time. Just as many Catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the Baltimore Catechism, fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie A Thief in the Night.  However, for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy, it is best to pass. For all its success as a cultural marker, its usefulness in properly understanding Biblical prophecy is basically nil. For this, its original purpose, The Late Great Planet Earth is completely worthless.  
 i think the spiritual ideas here are silly and even condescending. a lot of importance is put on the purity and cleanness of the yoni, but it is like saying something is opposite of what it really is. if the yoni is so clean, why is it always the worst smelling part of my body? i'm not for promoting the idea to guys that us women are nasty, but this book is just to promote self esteem in women. my self esteem is fine, and if it ever needs help i'll go to the self help section of a bookstore and not another category entirely! i'm sorry i bought it, because it makes me feel gulliable, as if i'll automatically believe what i want, just because it makes me feel good. i am proud to be a woman and i don't need people telling me life is a bokay of roses.  please 
 This textbook takes microeconomics which can be explained in a technical, exact manner and makes it abstract and foreign.  This textbook's sentences run-on and lose their direction, confusing the reader...If a reader had a firm understanding of economics prior to this textbook, after reading it, it is certain that they will no longer have the understanding of economics, that they did previously.  It is a travestly when a textbook designed to teach the reader about a certain subject, actually makes them less knowledgeable of the subject.  I must also ask why it is being used to teach university students in different years and programs, when it should not be, for example in my university it is being taught in the following programs  IBBA - Year 1 BBA - Year 2 BAS - Year 3 MBA - Year  
 Maybe it was the editing or the translation, but this book was a long and frustrating waste of time.    There was no spark in the writing, plot or characters.  It was as if everyone was either on Prozac or needed it!  I was really let down because the middle started getting more interesting so I kept reading, thinking it would finish strongly, but was disappointed.  Actually, the only reason I am writing this is because I was taken in by the many 4 and 5 star ratings and am pissed off that I was duped!!   
  I agree with the person who said it's hard to chew and here is why.  Disect your slim jim length ways...there, do you see the hair? It is (allegedly) all made of cow hair...gross! That is the beef part I guess. Trans-fat (partially hydrogenated veg oil) and some really long word chemicals to make "mechanically separated" beef and chicken what looks like hair taste "good"? no thanks, glad I did not buy 100!  My dog really likes it but then again she eats other dog's p..p EEWWW!!! 
 As a 5th year graduate student with extensive lab research experience at a well known reputatable school in New York City, I would not recommend in purchasing this book.  It was in fact being given out for free to new incoming graduate students a few years ago at my school, a practice which since has been terminated due to a general consensus from the student body revealing a lack utility in the book.  I actually told one of my colleges to "burn this book" because I felt that much of the information was actually detrimental to one's graduate school career.  A main concern about the book was that many of the so-called standard protocols were outdated and eclipsed by the fact that in terms of practice, many research labs have their own adaptations of protocols (for good reason) which are proven better than the generic protocols listed in the book.  You see...it is not good in science to hold steadfast to rigid ways, and in contrast one needs to adapt to the new social and academic climate.  It is a time of flexibility and novel creative thinking.  The face of science is finally changing, and it should rightly do so. This leads me to my second beef about this book. The introduction focuses mainly on "lab etiquette".  I find that the ideals brought fourth by the book come from out-of-date "old school" principles and functions to brainwash the naive young researcher into life-long scientific servitude.  This book only serves to perpectuate negative stereotypes of scientists in society as lacklustre dorks who do nothing but devote their life to research.  Many scientists are like this...and you wonder why.  The bottomn line is that I would not recommend this book to a graduate student, and not even to an undergraduate science student, unless you can find it used...and perhaps slightly singed around the edges 
 Expected more from this movie - although DeNiro was good as usual 
 I love the Firebird imprint and was excited to read this book and "Ecstasia", its predecessor.  Ugh.  I barely made it through this quadmire of perverse sex and terrible poetry.  I find it completely inappropriate for a teen novel (yes, I know, teens have sex) to be so overtly sexual.  Every page, every paragraph practically was full of plain ol' sex, bestiality, masturbation, homosexual and bisexuality.  Sure, it was couched in flowery prose and open-ended verse, but it still boils down to pornography when you take away the fluff.  And, while Primavera's childish songs were marginally better than the ones in "Ecstasia", I'm still hard-pressed to imagine how anyone could sing meterless, beat-less, pointless verse like that.  Never mind that it didn't rhyme, I'd like to see the tune that could follow any one of those arbitrary lines!  Bleah 
 Everyone here seems to have bought the line that the author and publisher are selling them -- that this is somehow a "definitive" translation, simply because the author isn't a Westerner.  This is a blatant appeal to authority fallacy if I ever heard one.  The fact is that being an Asian and a Taoist master doesn't make one a good translator, and this good is proof of that.  Frankly, it is riddled with errors.  For an example of a review by someone who REALLY knows what they are talking about, see: http://biroco.com/yijing/karcherhuang.htm about halfway down the page, after the review of Karcher's book. In the meantime, please save yourself the money and invest in a truly good translation, such as Richard Lynn's 
 The reason for the low rating is because this book is a repeat of Mr Garrett's book,"Let's Talk Treasure Hunting" which was first printed in 1992. Chapters and wording of "Treasure Hunting for Fun and Profit is practically identical.  If you buy either book, there is no need to buy the other. These books have some information on the technics of metal detecting, but is more focused in the end in describing the kind of metal detector to use which is the Garrett detector...which is a great metal detector 
 I have been giddy with excitement for this film to open. I've always been interested in Marie Antoinette and I actually played her charactar in a play when I was younger, so when I saw this book I became overjoyed and bought it. I guess what I was expecting was a story-form version of the movie (which I've not seen yet- it releases tomorrow) but instead I received what seems to be an over-priced copy of a screen-play with decidedly few lines (I read through it ALL in 20 minutes if that...) that shows no emotion nor pulls you in. It shows some shots from the movie, that are medium quality at best and some - I dare say - low-quality and blurry photos. I am disappointed that I paid so much for something that I guess I thought would be very different.  Bottom line: If you are looking for a keepsake because you love this movie or Sofia Coppola in general, than go for it and spend your money. But if you are looking to read the book version of the movie, then DO NOT buy this. This is a screenplay only and nothing more, unfortunately 
 After years of enjoying Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys I found Vol 4 slow and unemotional 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 This reviewer is grateful that this book was not her first Dash mystery, because it would have been her last.  Ms. Benjamin is too talented a writer to be judged on the basis of what one can only hope is a major and temporary lapse in judgment.  If you're looking to try her work, go straight to her first book.  In this book, Rachel Alexander comes off as not very likeable:  wearing the victim's clothes and jewelry, sleeping with the victim's boyfriend, trying to live the victim's life....all of this has Rachel coming across as a rather sick voyeuristic woman...In fact, her treatment of the victim's boyfriend makes her a rather cruel and callous one.  This reviewer does not understand the purpose behind having the victim's dog witness the crime or how the dog even figures into the plot at all.  And not enough Dash in this book!  Dash is but a secondary decoration in this book...and Rachel even goes out into a dangerous situation in the dead of night, and leaves him behind!!! The only good things I can say about the book is the writing style is good and you will be kept guessing as to what happened in the victim's last moment until the book's end; the problem is that by that point, you'll not care if Rachel herself winds up sharing the victim's fate.  Ms. Benjamin is a better writer than this; her character needs rehabilitation after this book.....The readership deserves more Dash and less trash.....This reviewer's advice:  Only resort to this Dash mystery when you've read all of the others..... 
 For those of you who love Jack Kirby....Skip this one.  It takes his classic New Gods and deprives the reader of the colorful atmosphere and mood that made the series so special.  Did DC think that new readers would purchase this in black and white?  That color would be too expensive?  I cannot imagine why the suits at DC decided to publish Kirby's work in this format. Wait for the color version 
 OK. I may not consistently turn out elegant prose myself, but there is a line. This book has crossed it. Opening the book at random:   page 64: "And me and Sheldon and May...." "...too bad for me. On account of May sailed way too speedy." page 65: "I couldn't even stay in my seat that good."  I understand that some authors phrase dialogue to convey dialect, et cetera. However, the audience for this book is kids who are still learning how to both speak and read the language. Learning awful grammar will not help them succeed. 
 In Lieu of a Review What follows is a slightly edited letter sent via e-mail over a year ago to Ben Corbett, author of This is Cuba, an Outlaw Culture Survives. It has not been answered.    Ben:  A recent newspaper article about the tattoo business in Cuba mentioned your book, reminding me that I had meant to let you know what I thought of it. By way of introduction, I met your friend M several months ago. She is a friend of L and our meeting was set up largely because I am a partisan of the Cuban revolution. We had what I thought was a good discussion. I don't think the Cubans you portrayed are very representative of the country. In your book I met tourist-hustlers, prostitutes, a pensioner or two, and some of the unemployed hanging out in the park. No cane-cutters or factory workers. None of the hundreds of thousands of veterans of military missions to Angola, Ethiopia, or other countries, or of the teachers, health professionals and construction workers that have worked all over the underdeveloped world. Even when you introduce a member of the Communist Party, she's an art professor who is also a Seventh Day Adventist! And deliberately contravening policy about crowding into the capital, "just to be there." In your defense of civil liberties in the Cuban "police state," I got the impression you were defending the "pickpockets, purse-snatchers and burglars" that were preying on tourists. Are they some sort of "entrepreneurs" to you? Your infatuation with "outlaw culture" (obviously influenced by "anti-establishment" sentiments here, but radically out of place in the very different society in Cuba) leads you to glorify some very negative elements. The story of the "extra" bags of rice is indicative: A warehouse administrator, a truck driver & and an enterprising black-marketeer combine to steal a few bags of rice from a government shipment. And sell their take privately, for a highly inflated price (to cover everyone's cut and a "fair" profit, of course). You seem to see this as an example of some sort of resourcefulness. What I see are people who have either given up on the revolution (very likely, I will grant you, due to its hardships) or who never were part of it. They are "looking out for No. 1."  These are the kind of people who formed the social basis for the rise of the Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union. The first step is securing a privileged position for yourself and a small group of similar types. The need for a police state flows from the defense of those privileges against the rest of the people. There are lots of people like that in Cuba. Thankfully, government leaders and most of the members of the Communist Party fight them as best they can. Kind of a vicious circle, don't you see? Underdevelopment, poverty and scarcity (in large part due to the US embargo) encourage such "underground" forms of economic activity. At the same time, such "siphoning off" of resources multiplies the difficulties in getting needed supplies to the mass of the population.  The urge, on the part of a minority in a position to aprovechar (to profit or take advantage) grows at the same time as demands mount by the rest of the people to crack down on thievery and privilege. Is there tension at times between "the people" and the Communist Party and the government? Yes. It grows out of the conflict between the mass and those bureaucrats that seek to form a privileged caste. There is also tension within the party and the government between revolutionaries and bureaucrats. There is a constant fight going on. Some of the flashpoints have been the Escalante affairs in the `60s, the "rectification campaign" and Ochoa affair in the `80s, and the entire "Special Period" since the disappearance of Soviet aid. I think the revolutionaries should be supported in this fight. Do you really think that if the handful of Cubans you seem to think are so repressed were allowed to run home-restaurants and mango-juice businesses unimpeded, life would improve for the vast majority? I think it would lead to the institutionalization of privilege based on wealth. From there you go to Stalinist-style repression to defend said privilege or to a restoration of capitalism (which would mean a return to neocolonial status, as there is no Cuban capitalist class with the wherewithal to hold off penetration by US capital). The majority of Cuban workers and farmers rightly see no prospects for themselves in either alternative. It's not repression by the government that keeps people away from the so-called dissidents and hustlers, it's the realization of the horrors they would be subject to if the revolution were overthrown.  Ben, I doubt that you think US society is the highpoint of human civilization. I am sure that you object to the commercial venality, inequality, violence and dog-eat-dog character of our existence here. Your book, however, seems to idealize those Cubans most disposed towards the economic system that gives rise to those problems. Class biases shine through your writing. By that I mean you come across (I believe that any book, no matter its subject, is really about its author) as a late 20th-century white middle-class American. A particularly glaring example: Your jinotero (hustler) buddy, Juan, is busted for the last time and given the choice of jail or job training (what a police state!). So now he's an apprentice brick mason. "Deep down he doesn't like it. He's an intelligent businessman, not a slave laborer." I'm not sure if that's his thought or yours, possibly a shared view. But, do you know how insulting that is to the vast majority of the people, not just of Cuba, but of the US and the rest of the world? "Businessmen" have no more native intelligence than any wageworkers, farmers or landless laborers. "Being your own boss" is a petit bourgeois fantasy, born of desires to ape the lifestyle of "one's betters." Accidents of birth, access to capital, and, yes a little luck have a lot more to do with "entrepreneurial success," than "intelligence" and "hard work." In the US, I doubt if you view grasping, cheating "cockroach capitalists" as leading the charge for significant social change. Their noses are too firmly pressed to the asses of the wealthiest "intelligent businessmen" to see where they or society are going. What makes you think their Cuban imitators are any better? I don't think Cuba's interference with the capitalist law of value is repression. It's a pre-condition for turning society away from selfishness and (unfair) competition, toward human solidarity and cooperation. You seem a little weak on Marxist theory: "...communism is...based on the principle that `each person receives equally according to his need.' The principles of Socialism say that `each person receives according to his labors.' The current Cuban reality and the super-human standards of Communist dogma, however, are rarely in harmony." The actual quote from Marx, "...from each according to his ability, to each according to his need," expresses relations within a communist system. Communism, though, is based on advanced technology and material abundance: "...slavery cannot be abolished without the steam-engine and the mule jenny, serfdom cannot be abolished without improved agriculture, and...in general, people cannot be liberated as long as they are unable to obtain food and drink, housing and clothing in adequate quality and quantity." Socialism is transitional to communism. Short of full material abundance, what is received must be limited, "to each according to his labor." It's supposed to be temporary. Trouble is, the anti-capitalist revolutions we know have taken place in underdeveloped and/or war-shattered countries.  Combining that with fierce capitalist resistance, the "development of productive forces" that Marx called the "absolutely necessary practical premise" of communism has yet to be established. And he pointed out the danger that "without it privation, want is merely made general again, and all the filthy business would necessarily be restored." (the Marx quotes are from The German Ideology and Critique of the Gotha Program). The difference between the Cuban revolution and all the others we saw in the 20th century is that it has a leadership that resists the "filthy business." The heroes of "This is Cuba" are part of the problem, not part of the solution. I found it galling that you let the United States completely off the hook for any problems existent in Cuba. No discussion of 60 years of neocolonialism, the theft of resources and wealth, or the repressive regimes sponsored to oversee all that. No discussion of Giron, the October Crisis, The Torrecelli and Helms-Burton Acts, or the Cuban Adjustment Act. In your view, the embargo is a political hobbyhorse of Fidel's.  Your idealization of "the global market economy," of "a full dollar economy" as solutions betrays a middle class bias toward the accumulation of wealth by a few as the answer to social problems. Look at what's going on in Latin America: Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Mexico. Would you claim that the mass of people of those countries is better off after a decade or more of "globalization" and "neo-liberal capitalism?" Cubans are better off now than in 1991 and '92. While they were forced to legalize the dollar, entice foreign investors, and open wide to tourism, with the inequalities and problems attendant to all that, their government did not sell off any national industries. Hospitals and neighborhood clinics did not close. Free education continued. Daycare centers and libraries stayed open. While there may not be a lot more than beans and rice, the malnutrition endemic throughout Latin America is absent from Cuba. If Fidel is a "dictator," he shows an inordinate fondness for the social well being of his country, a rather uncommon trait among caudillos (Latin American Spanish for political boss).  Actually, I thought your treatment of Fidel and your speculations about Cuba after his death the weakest parts of your book: a melange of bourgeois journalism, State Department estimates, leaked "intelligence reports," Miami Mafia gossip, and wishful thinking of Havana's chattering class.  Remember, in Miami back in '91 and '92, they were practically dancing in the streets, predicting the fall of the "puppet" due to the collapse of the Soviet Union. If the "opposition" was ever going to advance beyond the circles of hangers-on of the US Interests Section and economic privateers, that was the time to do it. Nothing happened. I have no "inside dope" on what plans or preparations, outside of the provisions of the Cuban constitution, exist for the inevitable transition, but I am sanguine, as are I believe most Cubans, that there won't be any big problems. Time, as always, will tell. Anyway, thank you for an interesting and challenging book, tommyboy544@yahoo.com   
 At a lecture at West Point United States Military Academy April 6, 2006, Naom Chomsky argued, "Just war theory" literature "deserves special attention but is ultimately not very instructive about just war".  "Just war theory" is "declarations of personal preference", which "never tells you anything. It doesn't tell you when it is proper to intervene, what it tells you is 'I think it is proper to intervene'...there is a big gap between assertion and argument, between surmise and evidence."  "We learn very little about just war from 'Just war theory'" what we do learn is "mostly about the prevailing moral and intellectual climate in which we live." Walzer's book relies crucially on such premises as "Seems to me entirely justified, or I believe, or no doubt." Chomsky then discusses scientific studies on human behavior which is noticeably absent from Walzer's book.    Walzer uses the term "I think" at least 52 times in the book. "I don't think" 7 times. "I believe" twice, "no doubt" at least 41 times, and "seems to me" 12 times (I write "at least" because the same phrase twice on one page would be counted once.)   Walzer's hypocricy  In a book which suffers from terribly bad organization, on page 62 Walzer finally systematically lays out his arguments, stating that "Once the agressor state has been militarily repulsed, it can also be punished."  On December 29, 2005, in an interview on NPR Morning Edition ('Just and Unjust Wars' Author Critical on Iraq.) Walzer stated that the Iraq war was not a just war:  "If you are going to use military force in someone else's county...There has to be a cause of some urgency, a massacre in progress.  A massacre in memory is not a just cause."    Therefore, if you follow Walzer's assertions to its obvious conclusion, the Iraq war was not a just war and therefore "the agressor state", the US, should "be punished."  But Walzer signed and endorsed The Euston Manifesto, which states in part:  "We are also united in the view that, since the day on which this occurred, the proper concern of genuine liberals and members of the Left should have been the battle to put in place in Iraq a democratic political order and to rebuild the country's infrastructure...rather than picking through the rubble of the arguments over intervention."  Therefore in Just and unjust wars, Walzer argues that "agressor states" should be "punished" but yet Walzer signs a document which criticize those who "pick through the rubble of the arguments over intervention."  Although the Iraq War is not covered in this book, Walzer's inconsistent views on the Iraq war should give serious students of International affairs pause before subscribing to his arguments. It is one mans opinion, full of statments such as "Seems to me entirely justified" "I believe" or "no doubt."   Walzer's arguments are unscientific rablings of one intellectual which are "ultimately not very instructive about just war".      
 Willard goes into extensive details about theological things he knows little about, or at least has only a passing understanding of. This book is way too long and gets bloated and outright boring in places! This book is filled to the brim with intellectually superior language, and a reductionist look at the Bible, a book that is certainly challenging, but not as complicated as Willard makes it out to be! He wastes the readers time by roaming from subject to subject, and drifting off the subject entirely at times.   I was disappointed in this work; it was not at all the 'gem' that I thought it would be. Read something by C.S. Lewis, Philip Yancey, or Henry Nouwen, you will be inspired and not driven to distraction by all the superfluous theological notions. There is nothing conspiratorial about THE DIVINE CONSPIRACY, it is simply another book that beats Christians over the head with wearying and overly complex ideas that may, in fact have little to do with the Truth of Jesus Christ 
 Look... I'm a HUGE Firefly fan.  It's my favorite tv show of all time.  Seriously!  However the comic just didn't do anything for me.  It's not that it was bad, it was just forgetful and short and uninteresting.  I wanted to love it... I wanted to find something to fill the gap since Serenity, but this isn't it 
 I bought this cable to connect an HP laptop (running XP) to an HP LaserJet 6L printer. XP did not recognize the cable as new hardware. I tried to install manually using the Install New Hardware feature, but that didn't work either. I finally bought a Belkin cable (about twice the price), and it worked like a charm 
  I first heard about this book in a graduate level Latin American survey course.  I kept it in the back of my mind and finally got around to reading it years later.  The professor had described it glowingly and subsequent references to it that I came across were all very positive.  Consequently I really looked forward to reading this book.  I was extremely disappointed.  Published in 1938 I would say that overall the book has aged badly.  It is overly dramatic, even emotionally silly in parts. The plot is insipid.  The Mexican characters are not Mexican but European with a little Mexican airbrushing.  The indigenous people are portrayed as one-dimensional simians.    I read that prior to writing the book Graham Greene spent a total of eight weeks in Mexico.  It sadly shows.   He has little understanding of Mexico.  I can't understand the continuing hoopla surrounding this work.  If you want to read some decent fiction about early twentieth century Mexico try something by B. Traven. 
  It was Mark Twain who popularized the aphorism of Benjamin Disraeli that there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.  I kept hearing all these marvelous things about FREAKONOMICS, a book by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, so when I ran across it at 25% off, I did a stupid freakin' thing and bought it.  I thought, What the freak, I've got a pretty inquisitive mind and I'm open to seeing things differently, to discovering new viewpoints.  The doubt started early when I got the book home and I first noticed the glowing comments on the dust jacket from the likes of Time, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Los Angeles Times.  When all of the liberal news agencies are lining up to tell me how wondrous a certain publication is, I'm immediately going to be freakin' suspicious.  Author Malcolm Gladwell tells us on the cover, "Prepare to be dazzled."  Well, evidently Ol' Malcolm is dazzled a whole lot easier than I am.  (I won't even mention the smug mug of Stephen Dubner that taunted me from the book's dust jacket because I don't want you to get the idea that I judge a book by its cover.  Or in this case, a writer by his physiognomy.  So I won't mention that.)  If you're the kind of person who is amazed to learn that 70% of auto accidents occur within 10 miles of a driver's home, then you just MIGHT be dazzled by FREAKONOMICS.  If I tell you that the company that issues its 5-day-a-week employees only 3 uniform shirts, thinking that it is cutting costs, is probably increasing its overhead, and this fact astounds you  - if you must ask "But how?" - then yes, buy FREAKONOMICS and be dazzled.  Mostly what FREAKONOMICS offers (when its conclusions can be trusted) is just what we used to call "common sense."  But since America has been reduced to a bunch of corpulent, brain-dead zombies staring vacuously at that box of SURVIVORS, and AMERICAN IDOLS, and LOST knuckleheads, good old-fashioned common sense now appears to dazzle the dead (when you can sever them from that box and put a real book in their hands, that is).  I dove into FREAKONOMICS hoping to find my purchase worthwhile.  I got no further than page 13 when my fears were realized: everything would require second-guessing and verifying.  On that page, Smug Mug tells us (based on a single report by the Institute Of Medicine) that "drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health."  Fortunately, I read YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER by Doctor F. Batmanghelidj over a decade ago so I already knew what a bunch of bunk that was.  In chapter 4, Smug Mug "proves" that legalizing abortion in 1973 with the Roe v. Wade decision was responsible for a national drop in the crime rate.  This represents the centerpiece of his book, both literally and ideologically.  The first thing the reader must accept is that there really has been a significant drop in crime since the early 1990s.  On page 92, the author acknowledges that the police in Atlanta were discovered to be underreporting crime in the early `90s in hopes of landing the 1996 Olympics.  Well, would police forces nationally have an incentive to underreport crime generally if it has actually dramatically increased since the `90s as predicted?  True, being honest might be means to an increased budget, but it sure would make your department appear inept and unable to maintain control.  And surely the Chamber Of Commerce and the big business interests would frown on that public perception.  Let me ask, do YOU actually feel you're less likely to be the victim of a crime now than you did in the early 1990s?  That's funny, me neither.  There's so much crime now that some of what was once reported to the police agencies goes unreported, and recently, an ex-police officer friend told me that cops can no longer engage in some of the micro-policing they were able to do in the `80s and `90s because crime is so out-of-control now.  In dismissing other possible factors responsible for the huge drop in crime (if this claim is a verity), Dubner states that increased police personnel accounts for only 10% of the drop.  Having a bit more insight into the nature of police work than does the average civilian, it's funny that I find myself even contending with the stats Smug Mug uses that actually WORK AGAINST his theory: I believe the wide-scale hiring of police officers since the early `90s could have impacted the crime rate only minimally - less than the 10% - while actually increasing the municipal coffers via traffic citations significantly.  And Dubner concludes that right-to-carry firearm laws "simply don't bring down crime."  (Be sure to read the utterly fascinating book, GUNFIGHTERS, HIGHWAYMEN & VIGILANTES by Roger D. McGrath, for a decidedly different and scholarly viewpoint!)  In dismissing all explanations for the unexpected drop in crime except legalized abortion, I didn't notice any mention of the tremendous increase in homeschooling and the proliferation of private schools since the early `90s, and I wonder if that might have some statistical bearing.  Ya think?   Yes, I think Smug Mug is selective.  He calls some abortions a "crude and drastic sort of insurance policy."  Not "immoral."  Not "sinful."  But then I didn't expect Smug Mug to call a sin a sin.    And even if Levitt and Dubner's hypothesis is correct, that abortions have lowered crime, the fact remains that not every aborted child would have eventually murdered an innocent person, but every aborted child was an innocent person murdered.  So why are we even discussing this?  I'll tell you why: because the pro-choice folks can feel a slightly shifting consensus, and now they're pulling out all the stops, trying to "statistically" convince the masses that they're safer with all those unborn potential criminals missing.  I find this repulsive!  (And there are studies indicating that those missing people have, and will continue to have, a negative economic impact on society.)  I won't even go into chapter 5, What Makes A Perfect Parent?  Suffice to say that as usual (surprise! surprise!) all the statistics Dubner employs nearly always seem to confirm the rightness of the liberal dogma on each issue.  Funny how those crunched numbers always crunch conservative beliefs.  Just know that if you're a working mother, you haven't cheated your child in the least, but if you're a dad who thinks that an occasional spanking is in order, you are "unenlightened."  If your kid is watching lots of TV, it isn't turning the "child's brain to mush."  (No word on whether or not it's turning his/her morals to mush though.)  And the studies (that we are called to pay attention to) show "that a child's character wasn't much affected whether or not he was sent to day care, whether he had one parent or two, whether his mother worked or didn't, whether he had two mommies or two daddies or one of each."  (I've often wondered what might have happened to me if my Mom, who was home most of the time, hadn't been there to hammer the dangers of drugs into my head day after day, year after year, while I was growing up in the `60s and `70s.)  I've given FREAKONOMICS two stars because I did find the section on the naming of children very interesting, as well as the story of Stetson Kennedy's fight against the "three Ks."  But if you're smarter than I am, you'll borrow this book from your library rather than paying money for it.  Economically speaking, that's just "common cents." 
 I expected much more from this book. I'm not really sure why, though, because we formerly used the Gallup test to select our  sales people. This could have been a good book. But the authors seriously miss the mark. They are clearly more interested in selling their own version of a sales test than giving sales people useful information. Most of the information they do share is not new. It's the same old stuff you get in Marcus Buckingham's Gallup sales brouchure also marketed as a book. The biggest problem with Benson and Rutigliano's book is the airy fairy untested psycho fluff they're trying to float as established scientific discoveries. The two authors are both Gallup's hired hands. They say successful salespeople are successful because they share one common trait. They "use their strongest aptitudes" to succeed in their work. "Strongest aptitudes?" Where haven't we heard that one before? What about intelligence and motivation and values and skill development? This book reads smoothly but won't work in practice. I know because we used to use the principles marketed in this book. But the selection mistakes proved too costly as we found out they also did for other users. Forget about the strenthfinder test this book touts. The book is an undisguised phising expedition for more people to take their sales test. But who cares? Does anyone still think you can trust surveys collected on the web? There are plenty of excellent books out there for sales people. Miller and Heiman, Tony Parinello, Spin Selling (one of my favorites), Dudley and Goodson (another favorite), Zig Ziglar, Huthwaite, these are the books salespeople should be reading 
 This book never touches on aid climbing it says half of what John Long says in his "How to rock climb" series, but not nearly as well 
 How is it that narada can pick over tons of albums and not come up with better compilations?This album is boring and the music is not even real flamenco.If you want authentic Spanish guitar music check out any number of awesome classical recordings by Julian Bream or John Williams and their performance of the works of Rodrigo,Sor,Albeniz,Granados,DeFalla,Sanz,Milan,Mudarra,and numerous traditional works 
 I opened this book to see how the author would handle the Swami's sexual indisrections. The Swami was found to have allegedly molested some women at his Himalayan Institute before he departed for good to India. The author glossed over this as I suspected he would. I was considering buying the book but I had to pass as he couldn't be totally  honest about these episodes. I guess he feared it would be bad for business at the Institute 
 Do NOT buy this book. I made that mistake but you don't need to!  This book doesn't really teach you anything significant. Phil talks about how much he has won and how good he is and shows you some animal pictures sitting at a internet poker table. Then on the next line he says that you should read the other players body language. Over the internet?! He doesn't even know what he's talking about 
 As a white man, this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it.  If an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published! I am tired of the double standard! Thank god I didn't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library 
 Considering how hefty this volume is, I was hoping to find recipes to produce well-cooked, flavorful meats with nearly any cut of meat I had in my freezer, using everyday ingredients I would normally have on hand. Not necessarily so. This is more of a gourmet's cookbook for those with time to cook, access to big-city delis and a liking for fussy sauces. Example: Puebla-Style Tongue in Chipotle Chile Sauce; Cured Pork Loin Roasted with Parsnips in Maple-Vanilla Sauce; Caribbean Pork Braised with Limes and Oranges; Sauteed Filet Mignon with Corn and Chile Cheese Sauce. There is some basic information on how to best cook some cuts of meat, but not enough to justify the price of the book, and the recipes rely heavily on the fancy ingredients. As a side note, if you don't like to include alcohol in your cooking, this is not the book for you! The recipes and tips on cooking pork ribs were good 
 I had to buy this book as part of a Network Management class and have found it to be utterly useless during and afterwards. It is definatly the worse book that I have ever had to buy. First, it was mighty expensive for the quality of the writing/material. Second, the material within the book could have covered in a much better way. It was very difficult to understand because it travelled much to far into SNMP/RMON. I found it almost useless as a reference, because it did not cover anything in a way that was pertinant to actually using SNMP/RMON on a network. I believe that Stallings definatly complicates SNMP beyond all reconition, FUBAR even. It lacked real world examples and uses. Perhaps this book would be great for someone who develops apps based on SNMP, but for someone who wants to learn about using it, its a massive waste of time 
 Yet another historical novel into which a lot of research and work was clearly put, but the result is dissatisfying largely because the author doesn't know how to write.  My single biggest objection to this book is the constant and annoying use of the author's alternative grammatical rules.  Comma splices and run-on sentences are not, and never will be, acceptable to me.  Occasional use can be overlooked, but Shaara peppers every page with them, tacking four or five or more predicates on to the same subject.  The effect is so glaringly obvious that it becomes difficult to continue reading.  The following example is made-up, but it is a good imitation of how Shaara writes:  "He turned in the saddle, rode toward his headquarters over the ridge, refused to look back toward the man receding in the distance, focused instead on the day ahead, forced himself to confront the bigger problems at hand."  One often finds whole paragraphs composed of several run-on sentences in a row like this.  The result is a book that reads like a rough draft, or maybe not even that;  it reads like a collection of notes preparatory to writing a rough draft.  I don't understand how authors get away with publishing such half-finished work, and I don't understand why readers put up with it.  Another problem is the lack of convincing characterization.  Everyone is vaguely noble here, with the exception of a few complete cads.  Washington loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  Cornwallis loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  Greene loves his wife and longs for peace and home.  I think you get the picture.  Few characters stand out on their own.  Even Lafayette is just another young officer.  The author assumes that we already carry our own perceptions about the major characters and will plug them in at the start of the book.  And Shaara's attempts at making his characters witty never work.  The result is a cast of characters that is tedious and dull.  Beyond that, I'm doubtful about the author's device of switching focus among the various characters in each chapter.  It's fine when we leap across the Atlantic and jump into Franklin's mind.  But the rest of the time, it doesn't work well.  I find that I sometimes have to flip back to the start of the chapter to remind myself who has the focus.  Either I'm a lazy reader (and I'm not), or the device isn't working well.  In addition, this device constrains the author to keep the narrative focused almost entirely on Franklin in France, and Washington, Green, Cornwallis and Howe in America.  That means that we get only glimmers of the happenings in Parliament and the royal court in England, and the continental congress in America.  In effect, this novel is really about Washington's military camp and Howe's dinner table, which makes the narrative unbalanced.  Some aspects of the story are interesting.  I enjoy reading about Washington's maneuvers, and the repeated frustration at coming up with an empty bag and finding that the British have eluded him.  I learned a fair amount about just where the various forces were, and when.  But I wish now that I'd just bought a decent beginner's history on the war.  Most of the book, as literary fiction, left me cold 
 There's a ton of paper in this book, overboard, in my opinion. Wading through the pages in search of a hike is downright laborious.  I've taken quite a few of the Sierra hikes and the information hasn't been detailed enough to really give me a feel for what to expect on the trail. They miscalculated the mileage and sometimes the elevation. I think it would be a better book if they chopped out half of the listings and concentrated on the truly best hikes in California 
 I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy  I made a mistake by buying i 
 Presence is a painful and shallow attempt at regurgitating Buddhist tenets wrapped in New Age emotionalism and claiming the creation of a new metaphysics for the Theory of U. The authors touch on a number of important principles, but added nothing to my understanding of them. Further, the book is peppered with veiled assumptions and unsupported assertions as the authors weave a world view of fragile connections between tear-jerking peak experiences, channeling for "the universe," and trying to get people inside an organization to talk to each other and their customers.  The authors are all highly-intelligent, highly-educated, and highly-regarded (that's why I bought the book) academics, but there is just nothing here. The authors' implication is that this is a book about healing the world, but other than some basic complex biological systems jargon it is not at all clear that they propose anything more than global meditation and a group hug. And despite the authors' fondness for oneness, correctedness, and nonattachment they had no qualms about nonattaching me from my oneness with $30 for this book, and they should. It's a disappointment and reads like a conversation between weepy teenagers or old women 
 I was actually disappointed with this book.  I've read 10-15 books by Robin Jones Gunn and I enjoyed all of them except this one.  I found the plot boring & I had a difficult time finishing it.  The first seven books in this series were great.  Once I started reading them I couldn't put them down.  I think I finished each of them in 2 evenings they were so good.  Not sure what happened with this one. 
 Dr. Marcus should stick to what he does best, lecturing.  This book tries to draw connections that are rarely justified, points that he may be successful in conveying to an audience in a lecture setting, but ones that  seem totally off-the-wall in a book as brief as this one.  Nevertheless,  certain points do seem valid and interesting 
 Michael Seid's extensive experience yields some useful insights and he explains many of the steps involved in franchising, but the book reads too much like advertorial and Seid spends way too much time trumpeting his own accomplishments. (Wendy's founder Dave Thomas' contributions to the book are woefully slim and including him as a coauthor seems to serve more as a marketing tool.) Franchising for Dummies would be a worthwhile addition to your library on the subject, but if you're looking for a single, objective, authoritarian source on the subject, keep looking 
 Charles Petzold is a well-deserved legend in the field of Windows programming books and has probably influenced more Windows programmers than any other author. I was anxious to learn from his views on managed code and the amazing strengths of WPF but his book was significantly different than my expectations.  Petzold totally ignores the powerful WPF tools and support available in Visual Studio 2005. Instead, over 90% of his book is devoted to very short programming examples of how to do extremely low level tasks in C# and in hand-coded XAML. It would have been helpful if these two approaches were shown side by side so the differences in approach and detail could be easily digested. Instead, for reasons I do not understand, Petzold chose to separate matching task examples by half the book's pages, covering C# and XAML in two completely isolated sections.  Petzold appears to be stuck in the mindset that prevailed when Windows was an infant and no programming tools or high level languages existed. During those days, his books provided the only legitimate source for the low level detail required to succeed in creating Windows programs. But, it's 2007 and Windows has a rich environment of powerful tools, frameworks, and modern programming languages to make rapid program development much easier and much safer. WPF is a significant leap forward that deserves exposure in context with today's programming environment. Petzold did not do that!    
 The premise of this plot is not bad, but the execution is labored and sometimes too off the wall. With a great starring cast it is a big disappointment 
 I work as a stockbroker & currently study for an MBA at one of the business schools in New York. I was looking for an additional text on Finance to supplement my required reading list. I came across this book at a local bookstore last week & was quite impressed with the title...  As I flipped through, I found nothing interesting and of benefit for my MBA... How could this kind of low-rate work ever make it to the shelf?  What a piece of JUNK 
 I appreciate that there has to be some of this to cater to the various tastes out there--but this book has way too much.  I read 4 stories in a row that were either about lesbians or bisexual men.   I am going to stick to books that have more balance or emphasize hot sex between men and women.  The other stuff just doesn't do it for me.  I got bored and started turning the pages fast.  Disappointing 
 For all the talk Stossel makes about how he exposed all that he claims to hate, he grants himself a nice big fat deal of a job at ABC. The only reason Stossel switched from liberal to libertarian was his opportunistic behavior. For all that he claimed to expose, it was the ordinary folks doing it for him while he stole the credit. Stossel would be better off exposing fundamentalists in the Arab world if he cared to prove himself worth anything other than a pile of dirt talking dirt 
 DVD's which play perfectly well on other cheap players, freeze/skip or don't play when I try to play them on the XBOX. Don't waste your money on this, buy a stand-alone DVD player instead so you won't have the frustration that I've had 
 First off, let me just say that I LOVED the first three books. So when I learned that a fourth was to be released, I was thrilled. So when I got in and read it, I was really disappointed. A lot of the plot lines that Ann Brashares has been cultivating since book number 1 seemed to go out the window. It was almost as if she decided she didn't like them after all. Both Carmen and Lena had love interests at the end of the third book, yet neither is so much as mentioned. The third book made it seem like Lena had finally gotten over Kostos, and had moved on to Carmen's shy step-brother. Carmen meanwhile seemed quite happy with Win. Personally, I thought the character of Win was good for Carmen. In the fourth book, Carmen no longer even has Win, but she has turned into a shy, loner of sorts on the Williams college campus. My spring semester of college is just now ending, and I have to say that none of the girls' first years of college seemed accurate. No one could change as much as Carmen did in the first year. Bee finally has the man of her dreams, and it seems odd to me that she would forget Eric so fast and believe herself not to be in love with him anymore. Also, she never seemed to be the type to jet of to Turkey for a summer long dig. The dig also seemed unrealistic. From what I know of them, it takes a long time just to find one piece, yet they were finding whole skeletons and complete pieces of pottery. Not exactly realistic. Lena, the one character who I relate the most too, never would have posed nude for a fellow painter before. The character of Leo is almost to perfect, and not exactly believable. She also has reverted to dwelling on Kostos again. I thought she had gotten over him and had moved on to Paul. Kostos even makes an appearance in the book, in what is quite possibly the most bizarre scene I have ever read. I even had a bit of trouble understanding what was going on. The whole conclusion of her relationship with Leo was a bit sudden and unexpected as well. Now, on to Tibby. First of all, let me just say that I think it is way out of Brian's character to push sex with Tibby. I also think it is out of character for him to smuggle a bottle of wine into her dorm. While I do think he is the type of guy to visit her as often as he does, I still can't believe he rides a bus for 12 hours every weekend just to see her. It's understandable when Tibby freaks out over her pregnancy scare. However, I would have hoped she would have matured enough to not shut Brian out when he so obviously was trying to help her.  I could go on, but I won't. I will say that there were several nice scenes with Bridget, her father, and her brother Perry. Otherwise, I would recommend the just first three novels 
 If you're interested in the Chrome model to match your stainless steel appliances be prepared to constantly polish it due to the water spots. My friend owns one and at first I was envious, but now I rather be less fashionable than freak out over the visible water spots. This model has the same shape as the Riviera and as I stated in my other review althought it is ergonomic, the Riviera collects algae on the bottom of the pitcher so I would be skeptical in buying this one.   The only reason I gave it two stars because it ultimately looks cool but you can't avoid the water spots and it may be algae friendly.  
 Now this is how art should be done. I love that a 13 year old can do what famous artists think they can do just because hey are famous. She has as much, if not more talent than an artist educated in Paris 
 I gave him more than 1 star because I think that a lot of good time and research went into this book.  It was a subject that interested me originally, but by about page 80 I was sick of it.  Mostly it is an account of Northern women before the Civil War, and how the woman's rights movement corresponded with the anti-slavery movement (for how can a woman urge emancipation for herself without feeling bad for others as well).  Sounds interesting enough.  That's why I bought it.  I was wrong.  There were a lot of quotes from Uncle Tom's Cabin and I started to think that if I wanted Harriet Beecher Stowe's comments about anti-slavery politics than I would read her books (the author goes on to quote another one of her books, Dred). There would be no reason to read or purchase this book unless it was to aid your research about the role of gender in the 1850s.  Otherwise I recommend to stay away and read something with more personality so as to not bore you 
 National Geographic Magazine is famous for their excellent photography; it is the very reason I picked up this volume. However, Wide Angle: National Geographic Greatest Places failed to live up to my expectations. I was underwhelmed not only by a large portion of the images, but mostly by the poorly executed concept. In a title that clearly implies these are the greatest places featured, I felt the chosen photographs illustrated some lackluster locales. Furthermore, the organization was too loose. The book could have benefited from better formating not only of its categories, but of the photos themselves, which are often stretched in an unflattering matter.  
 reviewer PTR said it right, but i'll say it myself: this great, ingenious novel, when we cut to the chase, really s*cks, is really beyond brutal. the writing isn't bad, it's frightening, reaching new heights of convolution and impermeability. i've read Faulkner and liked some of his books. "Light in August" was powerful and hypnotic, and I did the obligatory The Sound..., As I Lay, and another of his earlier novels, the title of which, for the moment, I'm forgetting (but I swear I read it).  Absalom Absalom, assuming you're not a Faulkner cultist, will drive you to near suicide, so keep away any nearby guns. In other words, you may be tempted to take yourself out of your misery, forgetting you've got the freedom to put the book down (i finished it, aware that it was taking months, if not years, off my life). Go ahead, Faulkner fans, rip me a new one.  I can take it 
 Absolutely DO NOT use this book if you are taking the new ICE exam.  I used this book about 2 years ago to study for the original TEA.  I was cofident and felt very prepard.  I was dead wrong.  The math section seriously gave me a panic attack - I am terrible in math and the TEA book did not prepare me whatsoever.  SO, I failed, but I took the ICE test just a few months ago and passed.  I used the Arco Special Agent book which really, really helped me.  The math sections are so helpful.  Even read the logical reasoning sections.  When you take the exam, you will realize how much easier the logicals are compared to the book 
 Considering that it's now been a year after the title date, and no comet has struck the Earth, let alone Greece (during the Olympics, yet), this book is a flop. Put a prediction and date in your title, trot out Nostradamus, and you may find that your audience expects results. To quote Marvin the Martian: "Where's the Kaboom? There was supposed to be an Earth-shattering Kaboom!".  Don't worry, I'm sure Welch will write another book with amended predictions. It gets a whole star because it's fun to check off the misses on major predictions as they pass 
 MacArthur was a military genius and a charismatic leader with a fascinating life retold by many a historian.  This work fouses on a single aspect of his life and while doing so thoroughly, does so rather boringly.  It is analagous to writing a work about Mark Twain and focusing on how he dressed 
 A book on AppleScript, written in 2004, that completely ignores topics "data sources" and "data representations" can hardly call itself a bible.  The problem with such books, that write from real-life experience, is just that. They miss the real-life experiences of the rest of us. This book asks use to shun the label that "it is just another book on AppleScript," but that is all it is. Even 800-plus pages of oversized print cannot justify the $60 price tag 
 I was interested in Dante's thoughts on hell, religion, and the afterlife as taught by the Catholic church at the time of its writing.  What I got was a detailed political history of Medieval Italy.  This book is great for the first few chapters, but then it becomes a repetitive saga.  Synopsis of the each chapter of the Inferno: Go to next layer of hell; describe in 20 words or less the torture found there; make fun of some political opponents, Catholic church officials, and so forth; prepare for further descent.  In my opinion, this book resides somewhere between the 21st and 22nd layers of hell.  Canto three pretty much has it right.... 'Leave all hope, ye that enter 
  Ironic that a novel by a writer who despised penny pinching and greed would have his novel published in such a way that to make a few more bucks the publisher makes the book literally painful to read.   The text is simply too crammed on the page, following lines of text is awkward and the lack of spacing simply makes the book painful to read.   Theres other editions of the book that are cheaper and properly spaced. What a disappointment this edition is. Shame on Signet for this ridculousness 
 It's incredible that this yankee brat likened this drivel of book to Papillon, one of the greatest books ever.  How dares he, this spoilt NY brat who couldn't figure out if to smoke hash or pot or be gay or not. It's one of the worst books ever!  It has nothing to do with Papillon at all! It's a diary of a whiner, a naive primitive, spoilt American, and a criminal brat. Let's face it, he did attempt to smuggle and he was a drug user.  There's no way around it! Papillon is a march towards grace and soul freedom over elements and hurdles of life told in the most adventurous style.  This lowly tale is a strife of a spoilt New Yorker, who never once had to work in his life and had everything handed to him on a platter.  His tribulations are of personal nature only second guessing his sexuality and penchant for drug abuse.  Nothing in the book makes for good reading.  It's of no spiritual or uplifting value 
 This book is so full of lies, half truths, misquotes, out of context quotes and manipulations that it would even make the devil blush. Actually, simple research will find many blatant lies in all of her books. She uses end notes in her books, but calls them footnotes. Endnotes are much harder to research as compared to footnotes and appear at the end of the book, not at the bottom of the page. I could list each lie, but the review would be pages long, especially when typing out the quotes she uses and the real quotes. Do your own research if you'd like, and I challenge Ann Coulter's fans to research her lies. But I digress, I think that most people who read her books, however, just want to reconfirm what they already believe and will not bother to research inaccuracies. Her most famous style of lying however, is using newspaper quotes out of context, or changing what the person said, or simply just making it up. A simple LexisNexis Search will reveal most of her lies. I found that more than 60% of this book was made up, twisted, or taken out of context, the other 40% was name-calling, insulting broad generalisations,and angry ranting which is, ironically, slander itself. Wow, what a great view of the Republican Right. If I were a Republican, I would NOT be proud to have her on my team. She is juevenile, brash, and most of all, a liar. I hope she fazes out of favor with the American public because she is toxic and an example of what is wrong in American Politics today, despite what side of the fence you sit on. I feel that lying to prove your point and name-calling is poisenous, egregious and morally bankrupt, no matter what political party you belong to. Do yourself a favor, and read a book by another author. If you do choose to read this, I challenge you to look further into what she writes. The lies begin in the first few pages.   
 My blood was boiling as I read other customers' rave reviews of "The Prince of Tides."  Whoever considers this thesaurus-scrubbing, self-indulgent mess of cliches a literary masterpiece has no sense of language and literature.  Someone was even audacious enough to compare Pat Conroy to Virginia Woolf.  What a joke!  Woolf's writing is brilliant, original, and real.  She cuts to the quick, whereas Conroy slathers his story in cloying metaphors and trite descriptions.  One can almost see Conroy congratulating himself on each simile and metaphor as he writes, not caring how superfluous or artificial his language is -- nor how unrealistic it makes the story.  I laughed out loud at some of the words he puts in the characters' mouths.  In the real world, nobody is as self-concious and self-reflexive as the characters in this book.  They do not speak in reams of figurative language.  I cannot even get into how inconsistent and impossible the characters are, especially the children.  Also, Conroy caricatures both places and exaggerates the cultural gulf between them.  (I make that claim as a Southerner who lived in NYC for four years.)  It's one of many, many flaws in this ridiculous book.  Read it if you like sensational stories with mass appeal (John Irving, etc.), but avoid it if you have any respect for the English language and for real American literature (Cheever, Plath, Hemingway, Cather, etc.).  Don't be fooled by all the fools out there.  
 With Polhemus being the chair of Stanford's English department, he's certainly a qualified writer. However, I wished he'd have co-author this book with an ethics professor, or an Old Testament authority, or at least someone respected in the field of religious studies - as this would have lended to the books' strength and credibility.   The reason I suggest this is because the premise which the book rests on is derived from the Torah manuscript of Genesis - and with that said, I'm not convinced Polhemus treats this text fairly.  I'd like to suggest why.   To rightly understand what Polhemus calls the, "disreputable Bible story of father-daughter incest" a firm grasp on both the literary context and the cultural context of the event is helpful.  With that said, even a plain reading of the text shows these incestual events are not merely the result of passions run astray.   Lot's daughters believed themselves and their father the sole survivors of universal destruction; humankind, they thought, depended on their breaking taboo by procreating with their father. As a result, they succeed in getting their father drunk, and then fulfilling their plan to have children through him. The manuscript gives no indication that Lot initiated this event, nor does it suggest his daughters were drawn to him for any other reason than their desire for children.   Polhemus places this account in the the modern context of older men desiring younger women and younger women being thirsty for the power and wealth of older men. In his words, "...in which daughters fall in love with their father's lives and older men are tempted by the intoxicating power and promise of youth".   Certainly, both of these motivating factors (lust for youth and lust for power) may be true in what we observe today in society, but to derive those conclusions from this ancient text is to unnaturally reshape the story itself.   
 Checked this sad excuse for a book out at the library -- glad I didn't pay for it. Stay at home moms unite in our insecurities -- that is these authors' message loud and clear. (Hello, Dr. Laura is known for this muck, yet where is her family?) Ever notice the lack of books written by working moms who criticize stay at home moms? They're generally too busy applying themselves to better pursuits. I'm a part-time working mom who is proud to set an example for my daughter. She won't be anyone's handmaiden in life. We should all have higher hopes for our daughters. They can and should do BOTH 
 If you think you'd find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting, then you'll enjoy this book. 
 Has the superior writing of Frank McCourt and Roddy Doyle opened the door for anyone to believe their memoirs are worthy of public interest? Dublin Made Me, is at best a watery account of Sheridan's childhood which fails  miserably to grip the reader and maintain interest.  This account is more  appropriate for bedtime anecdotes handed from father to child, than  anything even remotely comparable to the writings of McCourt and other  contemporaries.  If the reader is anticipating the rawness and vigor  associated with the accounts of others who have shown the best and the  worst of Dublin life, then they will be disappointed. A very forgettable  read 
  Unfortunately, this book says more about the author than the subject. If you want a book that demonstrates a problem, illustrates a potential solution and its applications; then don't buy this. This is a very personal and hence cloudy view of the subject matter. There is some useful information in this book but it is hidden behind the grand philosophical statements or buried in the foot notes.  Has this author ever met an empirical scientist, rather than mathematicians or philosophers. Scientists love measuring things. No scientist would ask the question 'Is an apple red or green?' They would pose the question 'How much pigment (in milligrams) of each of a series of colours does each apple have?' Or in truth something far more obtuse. In fact the fuzzy logic treatment would be a bit black and white for most scientists.   I suspect that there is a great deal more to the subject that the author communicates and I felt a bit cheated that there was not more substance in this book.  Did I miss something? If I did then the book did not work to convey the subject. If I didn't then fuzzy logic is one of a myriad of tools to handle uncertainty, and thus is a small branch of probability.   
 I've recently discovered Krentz at a local library. I've read most of her works by now, and her formula is a little worn from being used so often. I keep reading her mostly because there are flashes of brilliance in her  works that promise to be something more, but all of them then get lost.  Grand Passion is the worst of the lot -- I figured out the mystery of the  paintings by the second or third chapter, and the suspense and romance was  so unrealistic I was skimming every other sentence just to have the relief  of getting to the end 
 Purchased this phone as an upgrade from the i530, which I loved. I was at the end of a 2 year contract, and felt that I would get something with a few more bells and whistles - and was excited about the color screen with the icons.  Two of my family members have higher end Nextels and all work well. I would have purchased one of those, except I didn't really care about a camera for my phone, and this one was reasonably priced...and I found out you get what you pay for!  The i560 felt almost cheap in construction compared to the i750, i870 and even my old i530.  I had it for a couple of weeks when I started having trouble with the clarity of my calls - I could hear them, but they couldn't hear me.    A couple of times, I had the screen go to Airplane Mode, even when I hadn't touched it.  The fact that you had to take the whole phone out to see who is calling was another downside, too.  My previous phone had to be flipped open to see who was calling, but I had a holster that could hold the phone without disengaging it.  Not a great design for this holster. Another problem is with the power supply. When charging the phone, it is especially important to make sure the plug is seated tight - and to check that is says device attached - it comes out easy and stops charging even when it appears to be plugged into the phone correctly.   Then I am on a phone call on speakerphone and the whole speaker just stops working.  Living in California apparently gives us an advantage - 30 day risk free guarantee.  Fortunately, we were on day 12, and after 54 minutes, one accidental disconnection by Nextel and 6 customer service agents, I finally received a return authorization and placed a new order.    Terrible, terrible phone.  Stay away from it.  Hoping the new one on it's way works much better!  Michell 
 Absolutely nothing new here.  And some points that made my eyebrows go up, to say the least.  Also, my copy had editorial problems in the Vitamins and Supplements section.  I've written to the editor to see if he'll send me a complete copy (I had paragraphs of text just missing).  But in terms of content, it was just old and tired and dull.  The book itself was a tough read and the tone, overall, was as if Clark were writing to the average walker trying to finish her first marathon.  There's nothing here you can't find at Runner's World or a million other magazines/web sites.  And I tend to think you can do better elsewhere.  I would not recommend it. 
 Approximately 250 pages of hybridised vacuity build from snippets of information coralled together.  I can best describe this work as almost entirely cliche ridden.  It is further evidence that human computer interaction studies are largely 'solutions' in search of problems.  The chapter on 'mega-creativity' is replete with casual opinion and banal anecdotes.  Likewise chapters on the 'new education' and 'new medicine' are pitched several degrees below what the average Time or News Week reader would expect in content.  Overall this is a poor piece of work in terms of content and I regret having wasted money on it.  At some point in time, I hope that a Shokal equivalent emerges to debunk the self-aggrandising twaddle that typifies most HCI work. 
 Calling "The Truelove', whose story is primarily that of Clarissa Oakes, a woman who has been sexually abused from early girlhood until she boards Aubrey's ship [and, one might argue, until she leaves] a light hearted romp is misleading.  Hardly the first time this series has dealt with the impact of a woman on 'the wooden world' that Aubrey, Maturin and the ever changing cast of supporting characters inhabit, this time it shows everyone behaving in odd and surprising ways. Jack is thick headed and oblivious. Stephen, normally so clear-eyed, sends Clarissa, who admits not only to disliking children but to throwing an infant down a well, to stay with his wife and their newborn. Pullings throws off his sense of duty and is befuddled as well as bewitched.  Since Clarissa [like all O'Brian's 'strong' females] is really a man in a skirt [for a woman in uniform we have the aptly named Killick, in all his shrewish glory] she is far too flat, vague and undeveloped to carry such large portions of the plot with any measure of success.  This is definitely the worst book of the series and, sadly, in some ways not a good book at all. Not just because the plot is so out of place in this series, or even because characters you have grown to know start behaving in ways that are inexplicable, but because they have almost disappeared from the story to be replaced by someone you can't actually care about because she seems so fake 
 This work is poorly written and difficult to understand. Philosophy books are dense in the first place, but this edition adds to any confusion and created lots of headaches. Furthermore, the book in other editions usually have line numbers so that people can compair notes across editions, the Dover book lacks these. I purchased a different book and found in depth analysis to be much easier 
 Unbelievably complicated by totally useless information that is neither funny, relevant or useful.  It could be easily whittled down to 10 pages, and even then it would contain less info than the Tiger OS Owner's Manual.  Spend your $$$ on something else! 
 Most of the information is very "theoritical" and "limited" -- author focus mainly on her own analysis of her mother and her relationship with her.  ...  In a nutshell, the message is that a dysfunctional mother'll pass her emotioanal issues to her daughter(s), and in turn, the daughter(s) may pass that onto her offspring(s).  ...   
 I was waiting to get into ths book...then I realized I was halfway thru it.  I always stick with Berg...you never know when you'll get hooked.  But this one did not have it...I was relieved when it ended 
 Keep looking!  If you want it bad enough just keep checking the stores.  One place I would have never thought of looking was Younkers.  I went in there mid-January and they were fully stocked even with the hard to find woody and buzz, hamm, etc...They were higher than walmart, but a lot less than this 
 The best thing about this tiresome mess is the stunning cinematography and Scorsese's knowledge of New York personalities. But the film utterly fails to capture the magnetism of boxing in its heyday, or provide a fascinating insight into a driven contender from the streets.  From the all-too-obvious movie references to the overweening sentimentality, Scorsese tries to make an Elia Kazan-esque masterpiece and fails miserably. DeNiro's performance as LaMotta is a lot of what we would see from him in later years --monomaniacal mumbling, zero charisma; an almost self-congratulatory exercise in the excesses of dramaturgy.  Who was Jake La Motta? Why was he this way? What was his background? What did he hope to achieve? On the Criterion Laserdisc of this film, La Motta himself in three minutes gives more insight into these things than Scorsese and Schrader's drama does in over two hours. To me, that's BAD filmaking.  I have heard from film snobs that much of Raging Bull's fascination lies in the significance it holds in the oevre of Scorsese. He had just failed miserably with New York, New York and this was almost a religious purging of his soul. I suppose if you want to read into it, be my guest. I consider that self-absorption. I have also heard the patronizing "it's funny" angle regarding LaMotta. I do not think this was Scorsese's intention and I do not find the serious issue of spousal abuse very funny 
 This is the only Heinlen book ive read and it will likely be the last. The story starts out interesting enough - the human race travelling through space in a giant starship that they believe IS the whole universe. Through the course of events, the main character, Hugh, learns the real nature of the ship and futilly attempts to educate the population of his discoveries due to everyone else's religious beliefs about the ship - the universe as they know it. This is another interesting concept, however, the story is marred with dull characters  and a weak ending. I would recommend this book for children in grade school, but not for anyone who is looking for "serious" science fiction 
 this is one steaming heap of poo,  Billy Boob Thornton has sunk as low as he possibly can, and Jon Heder,  just make Napoleon Dynamite Strikes Again, Napoleon Dynamite works at Burger King, Napoleon Dynamite Joins the Army and so on - stop trying to show the world your acting and comedy range, it shows in this stinker.  I would feel bad taking this to a flea market and conning someone out of two bucks for this waste of film. I will have to watch Dirty Rotten Scoundrels for a week to get the vision of School for Scoundrels out of my head.  And calling it "Unrated" ? Why ? was it because this flick is so bad that the even the rating system didn't know what to call it 
 The concept of whole language when implemented in California in the 80s was a total debacle and I see that there are still books out there promoting the "whole" concept, only this time it is in math.  Use this book only in addition to tried and proven ways of teaching math 
 The director is incredibly intrusive.  The camera is never allowed to rest on corps or soloist.  All stucture of the choreography is lost 
 Chris Bohjalian is a gifted stylist, and it pains me to give this book such a low mark.  It's hard to say much without giving away the plot, but I found the plot contrived and manipulative -- too clever for its own good.  The book started strong, but as the main character became more disassociated with reality, I became more disassociated with the book.  I finished it, but it was a struggle 
 This was the first audio book I ever listened to. Perhaps that is why I found it rather boring and unexciting. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had read it myself instead of listening to Joe Mantegna reading it. I hate to criticize Mr. Mantegna because I really liked him when I used to watch the show, "Joan of Arcadia." But there were many places where I would have accented certain words differently and I found myself getting upset at the way he read it in some parts. I love "lawyer books" but have certainly read better.  At any rate, this audio book was not worth the money I paid for it ... even though I bought it on sale. Maybe I am just not a "candidate" for audio books. I thought it would amuse me while driving to and from work and to my house at the shore ... and it did up to a point. I am now looking for audio books that are cheaper because they just go too quickly for me. I am now trying to find someone to give it to and I am also trying to find more audio books to try that are not so expensive. I guess I should re-join the library if I want to continue listening to audio books 
 It is unfortunate that such pseudo-philosophical and pseudo-intellectual drivel gets passed off as either Christian or thinking. Greer's book is riddled with drastic oversimplification of complex philosophical and historical questions, with blatant misrepresentations, and self-defeating denials of the possibility of absolute truth and a-cultural or a-historical observation. Don't people like Greer ever stop to consider that their conclusions apply to their own claims? If it is "impossible to divest oneself of one's culture and historical moment," as Greer asserts (p. 37), then this impossibility extends to Greer himself. Consequently, his claim is merely an expression of his culture and historical moment. Therefore, his claim is not absolutely true. And, if this claim is not absolutely true, then it is not absolutely true that it is impossible to divest oneself of one's culture and historical moment. Don't people like Greer ever stop to think that they are doing the very thing they claim can't be done? Doesn't Greer realize that he is purporting to make a trans-cultural, a-historical claim about all claims? If Greer's book is a mapping of postmodernism, he seems to have followed the map to the point of imbibing postmodern relativism. If anyone is interested in mapping postmodernism, my recommendation is that you should locate a different map 
 i read this book on advice of a friend, so i finished it.  but i didn't find this book gripping or inspirational.  i didn't have sympathy for any of the characters and the writing was bloated.  while i was reading i found my mind wandering and didn't feel a need to go back and read paragraphs or sentences i missed while wandering.  the characters are somewhat true to life in that they are total environmental hypocrites, but the book didn't present this as something to work on avoiding. overall a long read that just made me realize why so many people hate tree huggers 
 Just an ok book. Pictures are low quality. Would have expected better from Golf Digest and Jim Mclean. It is straight and to the point but make sure you at least have a solid working knowldge of all aspects of the game before considering this book. You can get much of the same information for free at various golf web sites. Not bad but not very clear in many regards. 
 This movie, based on the Thomas Harris book, is a remake of the movie 'Manhunter.' The story leads up to the events of the popular Silence of the Lambs film. Red Dragon was remade because the studio wanted to cash in on the surprising popularity of Hanibal Lecter. Unfortunately the supply of Thomas Harris books was exhausted. So they revisited and retitled this prequel to the Silence of the Lambs. In Thomas Harris's book and the original Manhunter Dr. Lecter was an intriguing support character only. But now Hollywood has discovered that Hannibal's character brings in moviergoers so they take every opportunity in Red Dragon to add or lenghten scenes with Dr. Lecter and put him center stage.   The original Manhunter was a fine film directed by Michael Mann. It featured Brian Cox (Bourne Identity) as Dr. Lecter and William Peterson (CSI) as Special Agent Graham. This movie is lacking in all aspects to the original (and to the book). While Anthony Hopkins's portrayal is as good as Mr. Cox's Edward Norton is clearly out of his depth. He is unable to convey the complex emotional trauma that Agent Graham experiences when he assimilates the mindset of a sadistic killer who wipes out entire families. Performances by Harvey Keitel and Ralph Fiennes are also wasted here. My advice-buy or rent the original.      
 When I was vacationing in London this past May I spotted this new Morcheeba CD at the store.  I bought it and couldn't wait to get it in the CD player.  Having only discovered this group a couple of years ago with the "Parts of the Process" compilation, I had fallen in love with the easy grooves and Skye Edwards talented, sultry voice.  (Listen to "The Sea" and then follow it up with "Undress Me Now" and you'll understand the magic in the range of her voice.)  Imagine my extreme disappointment when I heard "The Antidote."  Skye is gone, replaced my a singer with a lower register and very little range.  At times the new singer's voice grated on my nerves so much, I had to move to the next track.    The CD was a waste of money and the hour I took to listen to it is an hour I will never get back.  News reports say the new singer is already gone and will be replaced, not by Skye, but by yet another new girl.  After the brillance of the pre-"Antidote" library, I am forced to wonder:  What were the guys thinking 
 This novel was our February Book group text. It was not hard to read and had a restful quality about it. Unfortunately it did not say very much at all to me or other members of the group. Many of the characters were underdeveloped and there were hints at interesting aspects of their personalities but it did not go any further than that, so left me with a feeling of frustration and irritation. I appreciate that her forte is writing about quiet village life and the attention to detail of very mundane events but I think this can be taken too far 
 I purchased this along with a Sony DCRHC21.  This Carry case was listed as an accesory so I expected it to be appropriately sized (as other Sony cases I've purchased fit like a glove).  This  case is entirely too large to hold a miniDV camcorder.  The camcorder rattles around inside it.  If you have extra attachments and lenses maybe you might need this one.  Otherwise I suggest you look at the Product Specifications, note the dimensions and then look at your camcorder's size.  
 "Tribulation Force" picks up where "Left Behind" ended, and like that book, this one's slow. After the first one, I thought maybe things would start to happen in this one, but they don't. There are a few plot elements that are connected with endless filler. And none of the things that do happen in are completely devoid of suspense. There's one major event that we're told after the fact via a TV newscast. You might think that a book about the end of days would be interesting, but these authors obviously don't know how to write a thriller. It's just endless soap opera. This book and "Left Behind" should have been one volume. If all the books are the same pace, the whole series should have been a trilogy, but of course, then they would make less money.   Don't waste your time on it and don't encourage these talentless hacks by buying their books 
 Hi I'm Steven, I disliked this book for a number of reasons. It changed chapters to quickly, so it is hard to understand the life of Vinny and Li as a child growing up.  Once you start to uderstand what Peter Dickenson is talking about, he changes the chapters, so it makes it very very coppy, and  then you get annoyed becuase it keeps changing chapters, from Vinny's life  to Li's life, then back to Vinny's and then Li's you get the picture. And  Li changing evolution in about two years.(what I call the quicky  evolution)Li shouldn't think she is so different, all that happened was the  shark thing in the biginning of the book, and then the thing with the shell  at the end.  The Then story of the book ended really poorly, with she  turned the rock with the shell.  And the Now chapter cocentrated mostly on  her relationship with her dad, and not digging for bones and more important  stuff like that.  Actually I thought the Now chapter ended much better than  the Then chapter with Vinny finding the bone that Li had squished into the  end of the book, to end the Now chapter.  And that is my review of Bone  from a Dry Sea By Steven H 
 This is a terrible album from the first song to the last. The lyrics are obvious and cutesy, appealing only to little girls raised on "Take  your daughter to work days" and "Oprah". She has nothing to  say and says it over the most insipid pop this side of Tori Amos. Will  appeal only to Lilith Fair-fetishists 
 DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! This is almost 1400 page book can teach nothing, unstructured not clear presentation of information can confusing students. It seems like authors don't understand some times what they are talking about. Not clear presentations of examples can to mislead readers.  After reading this book nobody wants working with Database design. 
 The Pretender is an awesomely good TV show but why buy this starter set that only has one episodes from the first season when you can buy the complete first season DVD boxset and get this eipisode and all the rest of the season one episodes? And don't give me any garbage about it being worth it because you get 10 dollars back with the included coupon because that ten bucks back deal has long expired! Only people who like to waste money would buy this 
 When I read Michael Cunningham's A Home at the End of the World, I was so dazzled by his prose that I found myself stopping again and again to reread and admire his sentences. In The Hours, he combined the same stylistic virtuosity (paragraph after paragraph imitating Virginia Woolf's style, for example) with a novelistic structure that took three separate narratives set in different times and slowly wound them together to devastating effect. Specimen Days also presents three linked narratives, but everything that we admired about Cunningham's earlier books is missing here. The prose is utterly pedestrian, the plotting ranges from the unlikely to the preposterous, and the links between the three narratives are disappointingly mechanical and superficial.  The three narratives of Specimen Days are set in New York in different eras--the late nineteenth century, the present, and some time a century or so from now. To be fair, there's a thematic connection between them: in each case, one character sacrifices everything for the good of another character whom he or she knows only superficially. But the sad difference between Specimen Days and The Hours is this: in The Hours the three narratives merge to create something larger than each one is by itself, but in Specimen Days the three stories, presented sequentially, fail to illuminate--or even to relate to--one another. Instead, they're connected merely by a quirk (in each, there's a character who recites lines from Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass), a prop (a white porcelain bowl), and the characters' similar names. One thinks longingly of the subtly with which Cunningham evolved the stories in The Hours and wonders what went wrong here.  Each of the stories in Specimen Days is more improbable than the last. The most successful is the first, about a boy who gives up everything to save another character from a disaster he only imagines and ends up saving her from an actual unimagined real disaster. (Since this story is the one most worth reading, I won't give away more of the plot.)  In the second story, a police hotline operator/psychologist unaccountably walks away from her career and her boyfriend to go on the lam with a child bomber whom the police are seeking and who, she thinks, will eventually kill her anyway. Sure. The third story is set in a United States that has been visited by a new species (think large versions of the Geico gecko, but without the engaging British accent) and that has been largely laid waste by some kind of unspecified nuclear or ecological disaster. The story has to do with a lizard character who helps a near-human android get from New York to Denver so that the android can contact his creator. The android suffers from an inability to experience human emotions, but through a turn of events when they reach Denver, he discovers that he can experience beauty and compassion like a full human being after all. "It seems I did a better job with you than I'd realized," says the android maker approvingly. That's right: think Star Trek's Mr. Data meets the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz. How amazing, how disappointing, that such derivative dreck is coming from the pen of Michael Cunningham.   
 My daughter is "into" the Civil War so I bought this book for her.  I read it first and am glad I did.  I cannot recommend it.  It is boring and has very little suspense.  I know the Civil War was a sad and serious time, but familied still had some happy times in the midst of it!  Cass, the main character's younger sister, has visions and all sorts of weird things.  I do not want to expose my children to that. Another character also reads cards and supposedly has second sight.  These things are occultic to me.  Therefore I cannot recommend this book at all 
 I had a friend of mine give me the cookbook as a present and I even went to Santa Fe last month and went to Harrys. Well the cookbook is nice to look at but it is not a real cookbook. More like a coffee table book. Pretty pictures and recipes that just are average. Also after going to Harrys I realize that there is really nothing special about this place but that the owner yells at his staff and the local paper identified him as hiring a lot of illegal aliens. What a disappointment 
 This book tells you nothing about collections that you haven't already seen in the movies & with your mental sterotypes.  It borders on criminality ...  I recommend it to convicts & gangsters 
 First off, the person who wrote about her ingenious husband who invented the trick of squeezing the air out before screwing the top on?  Yeah, I'd call him creative, but not the one who 'invented' that trick.  I had to giggle to myself and then post this publicly... myself and my whole group of friends used that trick.  Secondly, the liners are too expensive, and third, how in the world do you mix formula in these things?  They worked great for breastmilk, but the hassle of having to mix formula in a seperate container and then pour it into the liners was just too much for me at 3 am with a screaming kid.  Even waiting to warm it up under hot running water took too long.  Give me the regular bottles any day.   PS- bisphenol-A... what about high fructose corn syrup, cargeenan (which is the sludge that comes from soybean processing and is put in nearly every food on the market as a preservative) and even - gasp- the probability that your kid might someday eat a bug that has eaten off a chemically-treated cornfield!  I'm all for protecting your kids but you can't save them from everything and there are much more harmful substances out there 
 Mr. West writes about the Vatican not about the Roman Catholic Church. If he had not been a priest i would  have understand some of his descriptions  about Catholic Church. Since he has enouph information on the subject it  seems he wants to "reprove" some of the Church's institutions by  providing information he knows not beeing totaly correct. Saying half a  true it is the better way to say a lie Maria Santo 
 this is a wonderful value. full of fact filled fun. my 10 yr old grandson has every year. he waits until christmas when he knows he will get the new one. he compares it to the other records from years back. this is a wonderful gift for anyone and is great when also bought with the ripley series. it is fasinating what records people accomplish. c 
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 My 3 year old and my 1 year old play so nicely together with this toy.  My only complaint is that it could be heavier on the bottom; it's toppled over a couple of times.  Otherwise, it's great; they love the 'burners' which make noise & light up.  I bought some more accessories because there's not too many included 
 I agree with the reviews below: this is a fabulous collection of verb paradigms for both learning and reference. But a significant flaw is that neither the word stress nor the quality of the stressed vowels are indicated.   The stress on the present tense of italian verbs (and some infinitives) is not predictable from its orthorgraphy and it may appear on either the penult or the antepenult of a verb. Such information is necessary in order for a learner to acquire a correct pronunciation, and it is missing in this book.  Moreover, a stressed "e" or "o" may be pronounced either open or close in Italian verbs in the present tense and in some irregular past-tense and past-participle forms; but in this book, there is no indiction of a preferred pronunciation. Such information would be of great intrest to a learner who wanted to develop a native-like accent.   In order to find information regarding verb stress and vowel quality, a learner would need to consult a second dictionary.   As an alternative, I would recommend, at least for starters, the trade paperback called "200 Italian Verbs" by Barnes and Nobel. Although it is limited to 200 verbs, the stress is conveniently indicated by an acute accent on verbs with close "e" and "o" and by a grave accent on verbs with open "e" and "o". This publication is out of print but still available on line for under five dollars from used-book sellers.   
 This book covers a lot of grounds and principles.  However each principle is discussed only briefly making it very difficult for the readers to put those principle into practice, thus making the book not very useful 
 I agree with another review posted above-- don't waste your money on this book.  I was looking for concrete, real things to do with my preschooler.  The book suggests things like keeping a candle on your table and lighting it, then blowing it out, after each child says a prayer before every meal.  I can't see how that's sharing the Catholic faith, nor does it seem practical.  It also suggests things like taking your child to church, teaching them the sign of the cross, and praying with them.... all of which are common sense to most parents 
 Having read the book many times growing up & seen the CBS series, I was a bit disappointed with the movies. While great for loyal Christy fans who're familiar with the characters & the incredible story, I agree with some other reviewers that 'newbie' fans shouldn't start with the movies. The original CBS series was great!!!  Although Lauren Lee Smith, Diane Ladd & Sam W. are commendable, I think Kellie Martin's Christy, Tyne Daly's Miss Alice & Randall Batinkoff's David were MUCH MORE believable.  At times, the acting came off a bit overly done or not enough & unfortunately, Lauren's Christy struck me as a bit...bland.  The saving grace: 3 cheers though for Stewart Finlay-McClennan's returning performance as Dr. MacNeil!  Hope this helps: I'd try to get the whole series 1st, and then these movies 
 this movie was way too fictional. stephen king needs to stop writing 
 The problem with any BOC package is they try to combine music from a band the was the coolest group between 1971-74, and a commercial group that produced some of the lamest music I've ever heard.  This package only includes 4 songs from their legendary first 3 albums, 11 cuts from their commercial period.  If your new to BOC, your have to understand, earlier in their career, they were as good as a hard rock act as there was.  They combined top flight muscianship, with cleverly crafted melodies and riffs.  The comparasons to Sabbath are only partially accurate in describing their style, because BOC played a more dynamic and colorful range of tunes.  In fact, musically, I'd say they had more in common with Deep Purple, particulary in the guitar department.  Buck Dharma was simply the most under rated guitar player....ever.  Clapton was God, Hendrix was flamboyant, Page was a genius, Blackmore was tempermental, Johnny Winter was an albino, Leslie West was fat, and Buck Dharma, well he just looked like a working-class stiff, but man could that man jam!  The rhythm section was propulsive, they played organ when appropriate, and all of the songs had hooks.  They were rare then, and they'd be rare today, a hard rock outfit with strong pop sensibilities.  So much so, you have to wonder if Eric Bloom and Jeff Lynne aren't the same person?  At any rate BOC perfected their attack on Secret Treaties, and rapidly lost their commitment to rock n' roll during Agents fo Fortunes and all albums there after.  The other Best of... package to avoid is Workshop of Telescopes.  Eventhough it has a better song selection, the songs haven't been remastered and many of the versions are from poorly recorded live and promo albums.  Instead of going for a compilation, I strongly recommend purchasing any one of the recently remastered first 3 albums, which sound dramatically better than the originals 
 This is one of those books that sound too good to be true, and  is too good to be true.  The cover makes promises the  context can't keep.  There's a seven day "prequel" of very restircted eating, the "one day detox" of just juice, and a three day sequel of very restricted eating, all to be followed with serious dietary changes for life.  If it was easy for people to eat like this they would already be doing it and they wouldn't need this book.  There's a lot of good nutritional information here (although she said vinegar makes you acidic, when, even though it is acidic, it makes you alkaline when metabolized, which is what you want if yu want to be healthy).  Bottom line is, if you need to lose 10 lbs quickly, can stick to a tough regimine for 10 days, and don't mind gaining the weight back when you go back to your regular eating habits, this book is for you 
 O'Leary made an honest effort to provide insights into the mechanics of apocalyptic reasoning. Moving from definitions of apocalypse and rhetoric, O'Leary extracted three basic topoi: time, evil, and authority.  By means of a case study of the Millerites and Hal Lindsey's writings, O'Leary gave  the three topoi a home in the tactics of persuasion of Miller and Lindsey.  Though the subject matter is a timely one, the book does not appear  accessible to everyone. This scholarly written book includes intense  philosophical and literary discussions and presumes one to be acquainted  with rhetoric.  However, for the scholar who can follow the flow of the  argument the application seems rather trite.  Yet for the layperson the  application seems of utter interest but the discussion of methodology and  the foundational presentation of apocalyptic reasoning seems beyond grasp 
 I live in Washington DC, so I generally get a signal when outdoors.  Using these headphones did not yield an increased signal for me 
 What a horrible book! . If you are an IC designer it might give you 8% of good information, otherwise 0%....this book does not deserves to be called PLL..IT IS NOT 
 ...just like Hollywood and just like the music industry which, I guess, is the point.    John Travolta, playing on his character from Get Shorty (and, to a lesser degree, like his character in Pulp Fiction and Swordfish) is Mr. Cool.  This time he's trying to make it big in the music biz.  He discovers a new talent (artist Christina Milian) and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters.    A brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar.  The dialogue seems forced, funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile.  Most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae.  Aside from a few interesting moments, only one speech toward the end made by Cedric the Entertainer redeemed the film.    It's like a big commercial (which, I suppose, is any Hollywood film).  Certain musicians get shameless plugs (Steven Tyler and Aerosmith, included in the film), various movies get shameless plugs (including, in a not so disguised fashion, Get Shorty), certain Hollywood landmarks (e.g. the Mann Chinese Theater) are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the L.A. Lakers and the Staples Center get a plug.    It's an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or, in this case, making a musician.  So we watch Travolta as Mr. Cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give Christina Milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts.  The ending is so horribly cheesy I felt as if I was watching American Idol.  Watchable, but barely.  The Player covered this terrain so much better.  
 Pygmalion centers on a woman who cannot speak to save her life. She is the most interesting of the three main characters but also the worst to focus on. She is boring to the point of tears. She is poor, hungry, and happy. It is a typical underdog story where two rich and powerful men who happen to be specialists in her area of need -language-happen upon her in a gloomy British rain. Surprised? I was not. Shaw cut right to the point; after all, it is a short play. I do not blame Shaw for making it short, more of Higgins and I would have put the play down.  Should we try to pinpoint why the two men, more so Higgins, decide to tutor and to change Eliza, we come across purely selfish motives. Eliza sells flowers on the street in order to feed herself, and later goes to Higgins to learn proper English in order to become a shop-owner. Higgins wants to change her into a proper girl in order to prove that he is the greatest linguistics tutor, also, to win a bet...how egocentric. Selfish acts drive this play along. Here, the class struggle also comes into play as Eliza must not only refrain from using the only language she knows, but must change the way in which she holds herself in front of society. Shaw wrote Eliza's character very precisely to have individual dignity and determination to help her achieve her goals. The one thing I liked.  The play is about adaptation and transformation. Eliza's incredible strength moves the play along more quickly despite Higgins' pompous attitude slowing it down. Then again, without the diametrically opposed characters the play would not work.   Interesting class struggle and realistic language effort but overall, just a so-so read. Shaw has a good point: it takes effort to move up to bourgeoisie. He has all the right characters: a poor, pretty girl with a desire to learn, a snotty old Professor who is full of himself and a rich gentleman to provide the budget. Unfortunately, and perhaps due to the year I was born, the generation I grew up in and my penchant for sex and scandal, I found it rather dry. I am glad I read it, but will likely not pick it up again.  
 Listened to the audiobook version of this James Patterson novel in the car -- simply because my spouse bought it off a remainder table cheap and I figured we should get our money's worth.  Twenty minutes into it I wanted to chuck the first tape out the window the writing (and the audiobook narration) was so overwrought.  But then I listened longer as I realized how amusing the bad writing was.  A wonderful text here for a creative writing class:  how to write junk fiction that sells but which you'd never want to put your name on.  Sad that someone can write as poorly as Patterson and sell oh so many books 
 Biggest waste of $35 I've ever seen ! This was a required text in school , and approximatly 25% of the formulas were completely unusable. It was if this character wrote these recipes off the top of his head without the  slightest concern for whether they worked or not.I shudder to think how  many copies of this waste of paper have been sold to culinary students and  the general public alike 
 This 36 page book is very introductory in nature! If you want to know about Exchange Message Record (EMR) or Automatic Message Accounting (AMA) formats, it wraps it up in giving 4 lines of introduction for each. Not at all useful for professionals. Beginners should be able to find much more information on the net itself.. free of cost 
 I quite liked Alan Lakein's book, and got a lot of mileage out of it. However, I found his systems a little too simple to deal with the reality of my daily life. I'm in the middle of *Getting Things Done" by David Allen, and I find that it's much more real world. It also holds your hand a little more (e.g., step-by-step instructions on how to quickly get to the bottom of your inbox). If you (like me) are out of time and need to get organized, skip straight past Lakein and go directly to Allen 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 This book is very hard to read.  Excruciatingly painful in dull plot as well as the overly wordy text.  I am going to finish it as an exercise  in tenacity 
 Mingus' autobiography has to be one of the most unpleasant reads I have had for a long time.  Written in a 'stream of consciousness' style, well written indeed, the content is sexually explicit and continually negative about women, the jazz scene, whites, blacks and so on.  What is particualrly striking is the way blacks treated blacks in the period this book covers, at least according to Mingus.  Oppressed by white society before (and after) the Civil Rights reforms, blacks had their own hierarchy of oppression, based on money, colour (just how black you were) and 'status'.  Mingus goes on continually about this scene and one gets the impression he just could not get on with his life without blaming someone else, as if he was the only black in that situation. The only people lower than blacks, according to this book, were women.  I had hoped to learn something about bass playing and the jazz scene from an objective, positive viewpoint; this book just put me off.  Listen to his music, but don't expect to learn anything good about his life. 
 Same as the capezio jazz shoes, Way to small for normal people.  None of the kids(48) could fit into the shoes, in the sizes that where recommended.  All had to go up at least 2-3 sizes larger and almost all needed the wides. Very frustrating.  Makes me want to start my own dance shoe business-not for profit.  
 This is the worst sequel I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. I knew it wasn't going to be as good as the first one ,but did it have to be this cheesy and boring. They aged mia, got rid of michael, threw her together with some loser, and made up some bogus law about marriage. I was really disappointed 
 This book is waaaay to detailed. If you want to know all kinds of facts that really have nothing to do with the battle, like what every politician was thinking, what every correspondent was reporting and all kinds of other side facts, this book is for you. It begins with no real history or set up and concentrates on the embassy in Ho Chi Mihn City like that's the center of it. No way. I enjoy history, but why does almost every historical book I read have to be an epic bogged down by minutia. Give me a really strong overview with only the essential facts, and if I want to know every detail I will pursue further books. I have so many books like this I can't finish, and I'm a patient reader. That's it 
 This is a book of pleasantries for people who are easily influenced and can't think about what they're reading.  "Find the positive!" it says.  If your life is hell, look at the pretty shiny fire.  The author makes points that range from valid but unhelpful to contradictory and moronic 
 The Big Apple definition in the book is wrong again.  Other guide books have it right, but LET'S GO just doesn't care about accuracy 
 A much too simplistic look at a complex issue- intergenerational-management. To read this book, you'd think that Gen X and Baby Boomers are dinasaurs with attitude problems and that Gen Y comes to the work place with nothing but exceptional skills and enthusiasm. It would have been much more valuable to compare positive work styles and philosophies of these different generations, rather than using the extremes of one generation representing the nightmarish boss and the other representing the bright young professional. Keep shopping for a better book 
 Read the first few chapters and the last few pages.  As usual, the remaining 300 pages were just repetition.  Danielle Steele should come up with a new "formula" (as mentioned in previous reviews) or tuck her pen away once and for all. 
 Anything Goes is a fabulous musical from the stage of the 1930s containing show girls, gangsters, and romance. However, this film version has very little of the above and therefore has only mild entertainment value.   Bing Crosby and Donald O'Connor play stage stars, both enjoyable in their own right. They need a female lead for the show, so they split up in search of one. Crosby digs up Mitzi Gaynor and O'Connor finds Zizi Jeanmaire, neither of them expecting the other to find a girl. Herein lies the problem. Both girls believe they will be starring in the show. Steps are taken to let one of the girls down easily, but both men fall in love with the other man's choice of a star.   With songs from the original musical peppered throughout, the songs lose their meaning in a different context. The choreography is uninspiring and that singing is not all that great despite the major names featured. This one is a real bomb 
      It is amazing that Bob Woodard is this genius that can pick out all of the flaws within the Bush Administration.  How does he have access to all of this information......Oh thats right he really doesn't.       I am all for freedom of the press but shouldn't he be reporting it instead of writing a book about it?  Then again, perhaps the newspapers wouldn't publish this three legged chair of a novel.  Still, I have to admit that going into Iraq was a f**k up.  I didn't need Bob Woodward to tell me that.         Hey Bob, remember that Rommel did not know what was going on around him at the time he was fighting in North Africa (read his memoirs), neither do you or your "sources".         We were wrong to go into Iraq based on British Intelligence and a British Prime Ministers word (thats three times they have misled us into war).  Now that we know we were wrong we are truly stuck there until we can leave honorably.  To leave it in a mess would only make matters worse for that country.  We are obligated to attempt to put out the fire we started. It sucks but that how life works 
 What does an unsuccessful draft of a fine author's work look like?  If that question interests you, read Summer Crossing.  If the question doesn't, you can skip this novel.  I doubt if this book would have been published except that the story contains bits and pieces of themes that are powerfully developed in Breakfast at Tiffany's, also by Mr. Capote.   When Truman Capote found his writing voice, it was in writing about his own life and the people he knew.   Summer Crossing comes across, by comparison, as a writing exercise disconnected from his personal experience that has serious problems in its conception and implementation.  So what's the story?  A rich young New York socialite, Grady McNeil, is left inexplicably behind and unchaperoned for the summer while her parents shop their way through Europe.  In the best tradition of young people first on their own, Grady soon finds a way to break all the bounds of her former life.  She craves the reality of this new life . . . but finds it brings complications she hadn't really expected.  With that set up, one would expect a fine short story . . . but Mr. Capote didn't yet have the skill to turn the premise into a novel.  Later, he would.  Should the book have been salvaged and made available?  I think so.   Should you read it?  Probably not 
 The fine print on the box tells you this is a "multi-terrain" vehicle, instead of an "all terrain" vehicle, this is because while they advertise it to go through sand, and grass, and mud, what they actually mean is that it will go through dry sand, such as you would find in a desert, dry grass, such as you would find on the african savannah, and dry mud, such as you would find in their fertile imagination.  Mine has shorted out and stopped working just going through dewey grass.  
 I'm giving up on this book.  It reads like a first draft.  Sentences like the following on page 71 abound: "When you hear not so often as you wish, remember, our silence means our safety," the Committee of Secret Correspondence  - now doing business as the Committee for Foreign Affairs, although Franklin, who had never mastered the original name, was not to know for months - soothed the envoys, whom they understood to be starved for news.      Schiff needed a good editor but didn't get one.  This certainly isn't Pulitzer grade material.  I wonder if the publisher rushed this book into print in time for the 300th anniversary of Franklin's birth.      Van Doren in his biography gives a better account of Franklin's years in Paris. 
 I was forced to read this book for school and literally fell asleep a few times reading it. There is no excitement or adventure in the storyline and reading it just makes you feel more drowsy with every page turn. Who wants to read about a self-centered jerk who barely gets any better throughout the course of the book? Not me! If there was a list of the worst books ever written this would remain the chart-topper for eternity!!!!!! 
 The first was one of the best thrillers ever, with clever suspence, good characters, decent acting and awesome effects. This one is... meh. Why must you make a sequel to a huge success hit and turn the franchise into a straight-to-video series? What's the bloody point? Now there are some good parts. The rooms are pretty nice and the musice score is decent, but you know, that doesn't even save it. This movie is a annoying, pointless and downright piece of crap that only kids can easily love. It is so un-intelligent it really makes you wanna puke. The characters are nothing but cardboard cut-outs. I don't even know them well. All they do is scream, run around in the Cube rooms and cannot keep their mouths shut. I also really hate the effects in this one as well. They felt like they were over-used. There is even a scene where a guy gets cut into peices and look how badly done it was. The direction is ok, but when it comes to adding wierdness, it's too much. I don't understand the story, there's a strange sex-scene which a Cube movie does not need. Cube is about suspence. This one is just about adding too much effects, a four-dimensional Cube and trying to make itself look better than the first one. You don't need that stuff. If you wanted to make a sequel better than the first, add something original, don't take itself too seriously and make sure it stays true to the original. But no, you just had to add all this unoiriginal time crap and have alot of special effects taking over and even a sex scene which is not cool because if it's a Cube movie, you don't need nudity. Overall, if you wanna kill off some time by watching this crap, go ahead. I know you like watching people getting killed in unoriginal ways and watching sex scenes. If you're a fan of Cube, dont' bother.  Acting: 3/10 Ugh, don't get me started. These actors have bad acting skills and I hope they die.  Gore Factor: 4/10 CGI gore?! Come on!?  T&A: 1/10 A Cube movie doesn't need nudity and they don't know that because they don't know Cube.  Direction: 7/10 Andrzej Sekula did have some visual eye in some parts. I did enjoy a few scenes and I dug the rooms, but you know, I can't say he's a great director. He turned the franchise with straight-to-video written all over it.  Bottom Line: If you wanna watch, go ahead, then you'll be sorry. This movie is just sad. It doesn't try anything to impress you because it's idiotic. Lets hope Andrzej Sekula learned his lesson and should never do a sequel to an impressive indipendent film again 
 Back in the days of poorly written, bloated, snippet-heavy textbooks, Dummies stood out as friendly, approachable, and simple. However, another generation of clearly written introductory programming books, with advanced yet well-explained code, shows that clarity and good writing supercede cartoons and wonky humor. Probably yoru best best in learning C is to borrow several C books from the library, and find the one that best suits your style. Dummies for C may be worth reading, but I selected another book to actually learn from 
 Here is a professor of religious studies who is not an insider of vajrayana buddhism, and has given himself the task of 'demystifying' it through traditional western historic analysis. Though it is very interesting to hear about the geopolitical situation of the time, he assumes that this alone is what gave rise to the tradition. Thus, it's a newly revamped 'degeneration of buddhism' theory, despite the fact that this is a living religion, and that consultation of those who still practice it yields more valuable insights than an ordinary devotee of scholar ego 
 Maybe it's just the geek in me crying out for mercy, but I find a lot of the details of this book pretty far-fetched.  Plus, after we figured out whodunit and such, it just seemed to drag on forever.  I ended up skimming the last 30 pages or so just to get it over with.  I thought it was OK, but it definitely caters to a less technically savvy audience than I : 
 A group of disaffected Viet Nam veterans/cab drivers calling themselves "Green Band" blows up several buildings in a carefully orchestrated attack on Wall Street.  In the chaos they steal a large number of securities which they plan to sell in an attempt to ruin the American economy.  Archer Carroll, a US anti-terrorist agent for the DIA(?) teams up with the beautiful and multi-talented Caitlin Dillon of the SEC in trying to track down the mysterious organization that doesn't seem to have any specific demands.  There's plenty of action, but none of it's very interesting, and the story never really hooked me.  I finished it more out of curiosity than anything else (and lack of something else to read).  And the characters, while sympathetic, aren't very well-developed.  I couldn't understand why Carroll, who supposedly had a whole team of men reporting to him, was the only one who was working on a case of such importance.  Also, there's a minor Brazillian character at one point, but she speaks Spanish (I thought everyone knew they speak Portuguese in Brazil)!?!  Overall, marginally interesting, but I'm sure you can find something better to read 
 I finished this book quickly, it held my attention well enough but I kept waiting for the plot to "kick in"  and it never did.  The ending was a complete let down. In fact, after I read the book, I kept wondering what the point of the book was-it really wasn't about William Blake who was portrayed as more of a backdrop. It just seemed to be a a year's chronicle of a small section of neighbors in London preceding the French Revolution. Other than Maggie, the characters were flat and somewhat undeveloped...you wanted to know and care about them, but it just never happened.  Extremely disappointing book from a very good writer 
 Chapter 2& 3 provide good guidelines/advice for classroom teachers as well as school administers/educators 
 I don't even understand why Peter Heller wrote this book. First of all, his descriptive skills are awful. How he could fail to give the reader a sense of what the Gorge is really like is beyond me. Ian Baker's book does a much better job. Secondly, he was a hack commercial journalist scabbing along on a legendary expedition. I give him credit for pulling no punches regarding the kayakers' feelings about him. After slogging through this underwhelming book, I bought the DVD that the kayakers shot. Much more bang for the buck. Peter Heller needs to learn a lesson that my 7th grade English teacher taught me: Show me, don't tell me 
 I usually like what Mr. Peretti writes, but this one was dissapointing. It felt a little disjointed, like it needed more character development. When the characters of Randy and Leslie first appear in the novel, it's as though the authors just left two chapters out of the book. Who are they and how did they get where they are? And Who exactly is this "Tin Man" and where did he come from? There should've been alot more interaction between him and the heros in the book or at least a little more background on him or anyone else. This book could've been much longer and should have been.   Frank Peretti's other books like "The Oath" or "The Visitation" are much better. I haven't read any of Ted Dekker's books yet (I did buy "Showdown") so I won't blame him for this book. It's almost as if one or both of these guys had an idea for a movie based on a book, but had no book to base it off of. With the movie about to start filming, I fear this might be close to the truth. This may be one of those cases where the movie is better than the book. Overall, I have to say stay away from this book. 
 Having been fascinated by this subject since my first visit to Dachau in the 60's I thought this book would be a compilation of the "best and the brightest" but I was very wrong. There are a couple decent sections written by some fairly good academics, but some of them, especially the chapter written by Barbara Green, are just plain ridiculous in their analysis and conclusions. Her conclusion that Stalin's murder of millions of Ukrainians was not "genocide" is just silly. Not only that, her reading list is very incomplete in that it did not include eye witness accounts of how systematic the death sentence of starvation was actually carried out. The chapter by Stannard which compares the settlement of the USA over several centuries in an era long gone with Hitler's attempted extermination of the Jews and Gypsies is ludicrous. While he may make some interesting arguments, he ignores the reality of the cultures existing in the "New World" where human sacrifice was rampant, slavery and war-making were the norm, long before the Europeans showed up. Not a word about that in his analysis. He also equates the massive deaths of Indians by infectious diseases brought to the new world with the deaths in the Nazi concentration camps, which would mean that the AIDS epidemic which started in Africa makes all Africans the biggest perpetrators of genocidal death in the history of mankind according to his logic.  While this book is one of hundreds on the topic, it is not one that is worth the investment of time or money if you are interested in the subject. 
 I ordered both this and Honey Nut version.  I wish I had paid more attention to the Low Fat part of this version.  This version is hard and too cinnamon/sugary which seems to happen w/ some low-fat cereals.  They compensate for the low fat by sugaring it up and end up w/ a hard less tasty and less filling product.  However, the Honey Nut version is very good.  It has good crunch, but is not too hard and has tasty almond slivers in it.  It's sweet, but not overly for granola, and no cinnamon taste at all.  I understand many products w/ raisins add cinnamon and I typically like cinnamon, but this version is too much and the raisins too dried out and hard.  The package is very convenient though.  I now have to mix in the regular version w/ this product to help me get rid of the Low Fat stuff.  Some label info:  Low Fat w/ Raisin (LF) has 180 calories per 1/2 cup while Honey Nut (HN) has only 20 more at 200.  There are 12 1/2 cup servings in the HN while the LF only has 10.  Product weight is HN 24 oz and LF 20.5 oz.  Finally sugars are HN 11g while the LF has 15g 
 We need a one-volume history of European Integration, but not this five hundred page panegyric to...Margaret Thatcher?  In Gillingham's funhouse, Thatcher is the key figure in European Integration, receiving more attention than any of the individuals who actually tried to integrate Europe, most of whom are dismissed, often in very personal terms.  European integration indeed disappears from the book sometimes for sixty pages at a time while the author reviews political developments of right-wing governments in...New Zealand?  A very distorted understanding of European integration 
 Great for filling the doctors office magazine selection - if it's free - but not worth your money to own. I bought if for gardening inspiration and there is really nothing about gardens or gardening in here. Oh, once in a while they remember to put a garden shot in the magazine, but not consistently. The home section isn't that inspirational either. Go for it if it's free, but if it's not, don't buy it 
 It sounded like an in-depth treatment of the spiritual dynamics of so-called coincidences. It read like the one-page fodder from an old Reader's Digest. Seriously, this is a few anecdotal tales, and some of them aren't really interesting.  Caveat emptor 
 Lame! Lame! Lame! Corny sexual humour. No wonder it tanked- if the Amazon.com thing is true. Because it's bad. Don't watch it unless you think e*ections are one of the funniest things in the whole entire world 
 The "Latin" moves in this workout seem strangely like American aerobics to me.  You can work up a sweat by adding a lot of intensity to the moves, but if you're interested in Latin dance, my advice is to buy Brazilian Dance Workout with Vanessa Isaac instead.  This workout just isn't as energetic and fast-paced as it looks 
 I plugged this cable into my TV, and the TV did not recognize the source, I'm not sure it the TV needs to be digital. 
 After listening to the soundtrack from "Oh, Brother etc" and the sequel "down from the Mountain" I thought I was in for more good old time bluegrass. Instead, this album is yet another slickly produced higly commercial mainstream Nashville glop. The only thing missing are the rhinestones. I should have known when I saw the record was produced by Ricky Skaggs -- mainstream Country music. Oh well, live and lear 
 I WAS EXPECTING MORE FROM JOHN EDWARDS.  THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF REPITITION, AND TO LIFE LONG CATHOLICS IT WAS LIKE GOING TO GRADE SCHOO 
 It is very repetative and over simplified. He does make his point, then again, then again. While his one point was interesting, it's not worth the book. I read this book a few years back. Now that I have been more involved in the market, I can say that the book has contributed nothing to my experience. 
 This book simply butchers the story.  Blair was a hero and a tough guy, not some weakling, who just about gets killed at the beginning.  Furthermore, the idea of a full Colonel, who is over forty, having some  sort of romance with a Lieutenant, who is not only his subordinate but  about half his age, is simply disgusting, not to mention having nothing to  do with the actual story.  Avoid this book, if you have any concern for  accuracy in the Wing Commander universe 
 there is a handful of writers in the genre of fantasy who actually know what they are doing; creating their own history rather than dabbling in things that can only be described as monstruous fanfiction. sara douglass, however, is neither a good fantasy writer or a dabbler in fanfiction - she's a typist. there is no other excuse for the existence of this series; someome must have seen her at a computer and assumed that she was an author and accidentally given her a book contract - for this is literature at its absolute lowest.  1. random capitalization of names and places and races does not make a book stronger - in fact, it makes it look like it's been written by a mad monkey.  2. the popularization of a traditional hero/anti-hero has been done to exhaustion. the hero/anti-hero in this case is so boring and full of himself that one wishes he'll just jump off a cliff and die already.  3. problematizing a trivial love story into oblivion is NOT a good idea; half of the time the reader will have absolutely no idea of what the author is getting at, and the rest of the time will be spent in annoyance at the trivialities.  this is not literature; it's TYPING, and it is not even good typing. a bland, uninteresting character will not catch my attention by a double-capitalization (StarMan? StarDrifter? TypingAuthorWomanWithComputer?) that most of the time looks like the typist's hands were sliding all over the keyboard. this story is bland, unoriginal, boring and sometimes infuriatingly presumptuous. no reader likes to be treated as a child, yet it is exactly with such an attitude that the author takes on her quite ridiculously thin story.   stay away - or better yet, go read george r r martin. this is not worth your time 
 I have not read this book, but my nine year old daughter has read and enjoyed most of it. Last night though, she cried herself to sleep after reading graphic stories (near the end of the book) by an incest victim whose father was sent to jail and the daughter of an injection drug user who woke up one night with police pointing guns at her. I'm sure the inclusion of these stories was well-intentioned, but there's no way they are "chicken soup" for the average kid's soul. 
 I was hoping to read an informative, yet entertaining study on the history and impact of Hillary Clinton, whom I'm no fan of.  But the author constantly digresses into a pendantic rage. And ruminations follow one after another on Hillary's powers and why they should be stopped.  Yet she fails to make a case for why one should support or not support her views on Clinton.  The final 200+ pages take the reader through a thoroughly boring, month by month overview of Hillary's duties as First Lady.  By the final chapters I could barely keep awake 
 Short Answer: No  This caught my attention on HBO because I noticed that the producers are a bunch of former and current Pro Baseball Players. An opening day pity rebroadcast must explain why it was shown at all.  The characters would have been stock characters if any of them were even developed that far. This movie gets it so wrong that it isn't even clear that the jocks dominate the school, whether the psycho in the pickup is a jock or not, whether the hot girls are popular or hermits, whether the dorks are oppressed or just slightly less popular. I think all the nerds get laid without even much of an effort. When even timeworn cliches are beyond the comprehension of the writing staff it might be time to consider writing something less complicated; maybe the "hip" slogans on a McDonalds bag. Let the Family Guy Manatees write films like this, its their specialty.  Even the appearances of the hot girls are screwed up. None of them are in it more than about 4 minutes total and they don't have much to do but stand around. How hard is it to have a scene where someone visits a beach or has a car wash? Its been done in teen movies since the 50s. Its really hard to screw that part up. It was screwed up here.  I'm glad baseball is back in season so that a sequel is less likely 
 While certainly a better presentation than the Rod Stewarts and Michael Boltons of the world and their flaccid stabs at music way different from a rocker's sensibilities, Buble is a standards singer for those who think Kenny G is a jazz musician and John Tesh is a pianist.  There's nothing 'wrong' with listening to him...there are just so many better alternatives.   It's the songs that are great, folks, not the singer. Seek out the people who recorded these songs in the first place, when they had REAL musicians and the best arrangers in the world working with them (a nod to Johnny Mercer, who provided some of Buble's arrangements.)  Want to know the keywords? Sinatra. Darin. Billy May. Nelson Riddle. Peggy Lee. Mel Torme. Tony Bennett. Keely Smith. Johnny Hartman. Anita O'Day. Diane Krall. Gordon Jenkins. Johnny Mercer. Cole Porter. Count Basie.   There are plenty more, but you can find them for yourself.  If you think Buble is Da Man, wait till you try Frank or Bobby Darin. You'll never look back 
 Chromosome 6 has a great premise: what happens if medical technology accelerates to the point that scientists can create genetic doubles for people; doubles who serve as living organ reservoirs for possible future organ transplant needs-a sort of biological insurance policy? How much would people pay for this service? How far would they go to protect it? What are the moral implications?  Robin Cook comes full circle, returning to the themes of his 1970s novel, Coma. Coma is the novel that first made us aware of the dangers of corporate medicine and greed; of the subtle but relentless destruction of the long-standing relationships patients had with doctors, and the dignity those relationship once preserved. Now, a quarter century later, Robin Cook is shown to have been eerily prescient as technology has caught up to his nightmare.  Chromosome 6 is a very believable scenario of a technology designed with the best of intentions being corrupted for the sake of profit. In this novel, there is mystery and murder; medical sleuthing and exotic, international sets. There are a host of characters whose paths will intersect at some point-the set up is brilliant and we read with eager anticipation-but...this novel is so poorly written that I cannot believe it has Robin Cook's name on it. Though not high literature, Robin Cook's novels have always been tight and suspenseful, with believable characters and settings that seemed real. The characters in Chromosome 6 are as flat as road kill, the action as watered down as a glass of coke left in the sun until all of the ice has melted. Turn a page and the story just ends...what? That's it? Are you kidding? Did Robin Cook really write this? I don't think so.  
 This is the book the Pharisees would have written about how they dealt with Jesus...talk about spin.   Paul Pressler and Paige Patterson are the Annas and Caiphas of the twentieth century...they know scripture backwards and forwards, but they completely miss the message of love and grace and forgiveness preached by Jesus Himself 
 This is what you get when you have a philosopher, other than a backwoods philosopher or a Good Ole Boy Philosopher, talk about this subject....(See Title, leaving out "On))  Some kernals of corn here, but not worth the effort in working through the rest of the "stuff" to find them.   This gentleman didn't have a whole lot to do when he wrote this book!! 
 Two-and-a-half stars.  In Requiem, Faulkner pens a sequel to his sensational novel Sanctuary, attempting to navigate the troubled marriage of Gowan and Temple Stevens. He delves deep into Temple's psyche, revealing a woman unable (or unwilling) to escape her troubled, violent past in Memphis. Just as her marriage is spiralling to destruction, Gowan and Temple's daughter dies at the hands of their nurse, Nancy. Faulkner seems to be trying to lend some serious philosophical weight to the otherwise lightweight Sanctuary. Two problems. First, Sanctuary was fine as it was; a sequel was unnecessary. Second, the narrative structure of Requiem--half prose, half play--while initially intriguing, ultimately hinders Faulkner is his attempt to probe psychological depths. (There's only so much of that you can do when you're limited to dialogue.) Oh, and of course that annoying ubiquitous allknowing lawyer Gavin Stevens has to put his $.02 in. I recommend this book only for true Faulkner lovers 
 Me and my boyfriend found this book to be slanted toward the Jewish person who is having trouble with the mixed relationship.  I think this is a good book for a couple that will carry on a lot of Jewish customs and forgo the  Christian ones 
 This is one of the weirdest video adapatations of a novel I've ever seen.  The novel was an early work by Jane Austen (published posthumously) so it's not as well crafted as later works.  Despite the novel's weaknesses, however, even this video production does not do it justice.  The heroine looks like she's on heroin, Maj. Tinley (played by the same guy who played the older doctor in "All Creatures Great and Small") is positively creepy, his son, Henry Tilney, smirks instead of smiles, the Thorpe sister is just plain ugly (I should say she's just plain plain) and the Tilney sister is a stiff.  I can't remember whether other videos of this novel were available and this is the one I chose or whether there was no other choice.  The only value the video had for me was it helped establish who the characters were and their relationships--before I read the book.  As they say, "the book was better," and in this case, the old saying couldn't be more true 
 This is one of those CD's that are good for one song.  "Remind Me" from the Geico Caveman commercial where he is in the airport and sees his poster on the wall.  It is clear that Royksopp has done much better with their newest CD "The Understanding" it has at least 3 good songs.  I like Royksopp when they actually create music instead of certain cacophonous filler material. "Remind Me", "Only This Moment", "What Else Is There?", and "49 Percent" are their best works, 3 of which are found on the CD "The Understanding". They are pretty good, but if they really want to impress, they should continue writing songs like "Only This Moment" and "What Else Is There?". "Remind Me" is cool, but I was disappointed with the rest of the boring stuff on the "Melody A.M." CD 
 OK...this is quite possibly the most retarded device ever crafted. It barely picks up even simple dirt and debris, and when it does it fills the filter up and gets clogged in seconds, not minutes.   Also, it is about as easy to return the device to its charging stand as it is to hack into Bank of America and swipe a few mil. Really, its like cracking a safe to lock in back into place to charge. Stupid....stupid...stupid design. The same goes for returning the filter to the device and putting it back together...its like a rubics cube.   A true waste of 40 bucks. Don't buy this! It doesn't even look very cool 
 Most would say that battleships is a game of luck, yet someone known to me proved that there are some very sneaky tactics (without cheating) that you can employ to see that you win. Kind of ruins the fun, but a classic game nonetheles 
 This book does not cover the new exams that have been revised as of September, 2002. Don't bother, wait for the next release 
 This book was recommended for me to read by my husband's personal therapist.  He's in anger counseling, after coming back from Iraq, and I'm the one reading about six books right now.  While it was worth the read, I need MORE:  More instruction, more direction.  More getting to the point!  Lerner goes on and on and I found myself bored with the stories.  I'm reading for answers.  There are so many stories and you really have to hunt for clues as to WHAT TO DO IN YOUR OWN LIFE.  If you're reading a self-help book, then obviously you just may need some help now.  And fishing for "what to do" isn't productive.  I just didn't like the flowy, story telling way of writing.  To me, she spent a lot of time writing the history of a problematic relationship and then what the patient WANTED to achieve and then not so much as to what was needed to fix the problem for a positive outcome.  Too many times I read the phrase, "we'll get to that later."  
 This is a fine album if you want to hear Ethel Merman singing Irving Berlin tunes.  However, if you want to hear a performance of  "Annie Get Your Gun" with some real acting, this isn't it.  Ethel Merman's voice MAY be much better but my 17 year old daughter played the part with a lot more feeling in her school play.  For instance, "Moonlight Lullaby'  HELLO... it's supposed to be a lullaby not an aria.  Another example, "Doing What Comes Naturally" is supposed to be when Annie Oakley was an uneducated hillbilly and the accent in this version just isn't there.  Some of this may be a proud papa speaking but I just can't buy Ethel Merman as anything other than Ethel Merman 
 I won't say this is a bad film because it is someone's art. But I will say the point of this film is mute. The characters have no redeeming quality & it is hard to feel any sympathy or empathy for them. The plot is simply a bunch of well off twenty somethings with too much time on their hands who do nothing but gossip, complain & do drugs. The whole film takes place at a party in a bathroom with the main male protagonist complaining about how he messed up his relationship with a girl named London (Biels) in between doing massive rails of cocaine the size of Utah. With flashbacks scenes suitable for an MTV audience of moments good & bad with London. Pretty much The  Real World on cocaine. He relates his troubles to an insane coke sniffing impedent man from England who he brings to the party. Now I'm one for the dark drug film genre after all 2 of my fave films is Less Than Zero & Drugstore Cowboy but like I said this film as no redeeming value & loss interest in the characters & plot.    
 Put some samples up there for us good little consumers to listen to. Obviously this album has enough interest from people to justify   at least the first five songs. Are ya lazy or what?  
           Gene Kranz's experience from inside mission control is one that not many Americans experience for themselves. This riveting book expresses the problems that he had to encounter and overcome. Kranz was a major contributor to the success of the space flight operations and all of his accomplishments are revealed right in this book. Kranz's competitive edge to segue America's "space world" into the number one position and his daringness in the Mercury to Apollo missions not only helped unite Americans, instigating a feeling of national pride, but it also wired the world together to work in one common effort. Kranz is able to provide behind the scene information, sharing the myths and stories of the media about the men in the mission control and thus providing the reader with the true untwisted story.         Through this novel, Kranz takes us back to the primitive age of technology when there were no books previously written on the actual methodology of space flight. This book is truly enthralling for everyone, not just space buffs interested in the detail of flight control. The network of trust and driven scientists motivates the readers to read hours on end. The emotional conflict and skepticism provided by Kranz illustrates the intense life of these men. This book takes us behind the scenes of Apollo 13 and lays out all of the problems and obstacles that the controllers on the ground had to solve and overcome. By the end of the novel one can truly say that failure is not an option, especially not for Gene Kranz. 
 I was somewhat disapppointed with this. It was not what I was expecting. I was hoping for a concise chord chart-I did not find this extremely helpful in returning me to my music 
 The way this book is set up it does not teach in a good order. It has a lot of things that make no sense when you are given information suddenly that has noting to do with what was covered in the last segment and it is not instructional. Look at getting "Learn Chess" by Alexander as a much better book 
 The dog part was kinda interesting but the eclipse flashback(s) was disgusting and the rest of the book was really boring. It also could have easily ended about 50 or 60 pages before it did. But at least its short for a King book (445 pages) and I was able to force myself through it in a few days. Out of the 17 or so King books I've read this was definitely the worst, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you want to read every Stephen King book there is. - - 3/1 
 Cryptic and confusing muddle of mush. If this is the "new style" of writing, we are in trouble folks. 
 this can be truly the most horrible book by ms. coulter.  she's my favortie author, and she still is after this book.  she put genny through so many humiliating moments!  it'z really embarrassing for her!  and alec  is so arrogant and such a jerk!  ms. coulter gave alec too much control  over genny and this is the worst book i've ever read 
 I just finshed reading it for my sophomore honors class, and I am sure that I will never voluntarily read Faulkner ever again. Throughout the novel, there is no use of punctaution, such as an apostrophe, and the sentences run on for as long as a whole page. The first hundred pages require more attention than A Tale of Two Cities, and the narration gets worse from there! It's as if Faulkner didn't want to appeal to or reach any person. And to make matters worse, there are no book notes anywhere, save essays, that can help understand it. And so don't read this voluntarily, but, if you have to, good luck and hope that they have made sparknotes for Intruder in the Dust 
 Our baby boy loves jumping and swinging but this product is not well designed (and I'm an industrial designer Dad, so I should know!). It can hit the door frame easily, the seat is way too deep even though our baby is above average height. He's banged his mouth a few times into the hard plastic portion when he swings in or jumps in it. He has fun in it at first, but it always seem a disappointment in the end. Save your time and money and get the Baby Einstein Excersaucer. THAT is agreat toy and better for development skills 
 Admittedly, the reason I read The Bourne Identity had everything to do with how much I enjoyed the recent film of the same name.  However, the book bears very little resemblance to the movie.  So little in fact that I wonder if the writers of the movie recognized the same weaknesses in the book as I did: shoddy writing, a confused and over-complicated plot, and a ridiculously juvenile, untenable love story.  I kept expecting the story to pick up and sweep me away as most great novels do, and I tried to gloss over my own revulsion at the soap opera dialog, and blaze undaunted through the remainder of the book...sort of like sitting through a movie you know you don't like much, but sticking around because you've already spent your money to see it.  The premise of the story is also hampered by a sort of cowboys and indians, good versus evil, over-simplified rationale on the part of Ludlum's characters.  Their motives are described plainly enough throughout the book, yet those motives are difficult to understand because they seem so casually overwrought.  Both Bourne and his nemesis, Carlos are laughably thin characterizations.  So much so that I found myself reminded time and time again of The Young and the Restless...especially when the story involved Marie.  Too often, her character came across as wooden and forced.  I don't buy her devotion to Bourne for a minute.  I was actually hoping that she would turn out to be an undercover agent or a psycho or something...anything to make her character more interesting or believable.  I have heard that the second and third books in this series are better, but The Bourne Identity doesn't give me enough reasons to find out for myself.  This is the only instance I've found where the movie is better than the book.  So, rather than waste four or five days slogging away at another Ludlum "best-seller," I'll just stick to the films, thanks 
 As a current member of 3 Art Deco Socities (NY, LA and Chicago)and owner of at least 30 books on Art Deco, this book told me nothing new or enlightning.   I am not in any way a Deco authority, but it would be nice to read (and see) something new about LA.  Most photos are a rehash of already printed material and many need additional shots to explain the architecture.  For example:  the Wiltern Theatre.   The interior is 1000% more fantastic than the one exterior photo used.  The Wiltern is one of the best examples of theatre deco ever designed.  But, for those that have never set foot in LA, this book may suffice their deco urge 
 If Hillary's a cult leader, then where's her cult? Because I'm one of the ones Rush, Hannity, Coulter and the rest would have you believe are scheming in the shadows for Hillary's overthrow of apple pie, baseball, and mothers.  I'm one of the wingnuttiest of the wingnuts (or is that "moonbattiest" of the "moonbats?" I get all of these childish epithets confused).  And as wingbatty as I am, I can't stand her.  I understand (disagree with, but understand) the suspicion of Soros.  Big money colluding behind closed doors with influential and powerful politicians.  But this isn't a liberal conspiracy; if you'll just read a gosh darn newspaper, you'll find it's a conservative reality (KBR, the Northern Mariana Islands, seriously, look 'em up).   What I don't understand is how Hillary has achieved boogeyman status.  Like I said, I'm one of the supposed leftist zombies you've been warned about and I'm far from alone in my distaste for and distrust of Hillary.  The only people whispering conspiratorially of Hillary's agenda or even her political potential are conservative pundits and their devotees.  She hardly comes up during our zombie get togethers, and when she does, it's negative as often as not.  Indeed, do you remember her tepid reception at the Coretta Scott King funeral, even with Bill by her side? There you go.  And do you also remember what happened to Lieberman in Connecticut? That's Hillary's future.  We don't like opportunistic, sleazy career politicians any more than you do.  
 why are actors trying to write books, play music, and so on?  Stick to acting please.  we don't need actors to influence the lives of our children.  I completely disagree with the actions his characters take throughout the book.  play something for a year and if you don't like it quit?  that's a great lesson to teach our under 5 year old kids.  
   I've seen MIB I numerous times.  What I'm trying to find out is this....what was the name of the song that Tommy Lee Jones had on 8-track? I know it was by Elvis, but I cannot figure out the name of the song.  Any help out there 
 It's been over 19 days since my SanDisk 512MB Transflash card was "shipped" from EMARTBUY and I still have not received my order. When I contacted EMARTCRAP, all they could tell me was that it had been shipped. I am sure that flash card works great. I just hope that I will receive it before it becomes obsolete. AVOID EMARTBUY AT ALL COST. Don't settle for incompetency. Your are better off paying a higher price for better service...correction any service 
 I was disappointed, only because the music doesn't carry over the action of the movie.  The main reason I purchased the CD was for the song that Salma Hayek sang...her voice is every bit as sensual and seductive as in the movie 
 I feel really sorry for the would-be-writers who are taught by this author. If they write anything like this book--wordy, pointless, boring--well, good luck to them. I've read at least 10 books on the craft of fiction writing; I think this is the worst book. In Chapter 2, she talks about her student's fear of writing dialogue, and I thought she might be teaching middle school English classes, not college-level creative writing courses. Somewhere she talks about one of her student's question, why a story has to have a plot, and she goes on to say in many words why a plot is needed, etc., as if the readers of this book are all like the insincere student. I lost interest and went to the next chapter.  In Chapter 3, she talks about Genre, Mainstream, Literary. She says, "Literary stories are avant-garde and experimental stories that incorporate unconventional and nontraditional writing style and techniques. Maybe she got it right and other authors got it wrong.  In Chapter 4 (Dialogue that propels the story forward), she has subsections of "Dialogue that moves," "Provides new information," "Reveals new obstacles," "Increases suspense," "Furthers the theme," "Shows character transformation," "Reveals/reminds of goals," and "Keeping your characters in social settings." What's the point of all these? Even mentioning these in a paragraph would be unnecessary (I don't believe a person who hasn't read any book on creative writing would jump right into a book titled "Dialogue"), but this book has each of these points in subsections. Nothing what she says sticks in your head, and you feel like throwing up. I stopped reading somewhere in Chapter 4; that was last month and I don't feel like continue reading.   Oh, she has lots of exercises (each seemed like writing a novel; I might be wrong, because I've paid attention to just a few of them). If you like that (I don't), go for it. I've learned a hundred times more in a short chapter (Chapter 11, The secrets of Good Dialogue) from Sol Stein's "Stein on Writing."   
 I lived in France. I know plenty of fat French women. And French women who drink hard liquor every day. And French women who drink coffee more than just in the morning.  French women don't have the market on thinness by any means. People all over the world have guilt about eating and learn bad habits. The author starts out trying to be objective but her arrogance comes out loud and clear as the book goes on. And her dropping of French phrases here and there throughout the book are downright annoying.  Nothing new in this book. Eat less, exercise more. 
 This book focuses on Amanda Starkey, a young nurse who has suffered a breakdown and was sent home by her boss so she could get her act together. Amanda returns to her family home in Wisconsin to live with her sister, Mattie, and Mattie's daughter, Ruth. Mattie's husband, Carl, is off fighting in France during WWI.  The sisters are very close, and so Mattie is of course thrilled to have her sister back in her life on a daily basis again. They begin to embark on a new aspect of their life together, while Mattie anxiously waits for her husband's return from the war.  Then, one winter night, tragedy strikes, and Mattie ends up drowning in the nearby lake. Her young daughter, Ruth, almost ends up drowning as well, but is rescued in the nick of time.   Not long after Mattie's death, Carl returns from the war, wounded. He is eager to see his wife, not realizing that she has died.   Amanda, who has never liked Carl, hopes that he will decide to leave again almost as soon as he'd returned home. She figures him for the sort to not want to raise a child alone, and each day waits for him to leave, thereby making her Ruth's sole caretaker. Yet much to her annoyance, he manages to get his bearings again and remains a fixture in both hers and Ruth's life.  At the same time, Amanda struggles with inner demons, both because of what happened to her sister, and because of what happened in her life prior to returning home, which you eventually learn about. She is then sent to a sanatorium and Carl is left to care for his daughter on his own. However, he founders, and ends up relying on a second cousin (Hilda) for her grudging help.   This new upheaval causes Ruth to regress a great deal, and she stops talking and acts out by breaking things in the house and being impossible to toilet train and deal with overall. In a funny turn of events, Ruth manages to embarrass Hilda enough so that she leaves. Carl, in an act of desperation, takes Ruth with him on one of his many visits to see Amanda, in the hope that it will spark a desire in her to get well once and for all. It works, and a year after having been committed, Amanda returns home.  The rest of the story vacillates between what really happened the night Mattie drowned, and what is happening in Amanda and Ruth's life afterwards. In the first part of the book, Ruth ages from about 3-5. When the second part begins, she is already 11. I felt that was somewhat abrupt, and it took me a few pages to realize how much time had passed, as there wasn't anything to indicate that this had happened.   The book continued to bounce around a lot from this point on, between reminiscences of the past and what was actually happening to the characters months or years down the line. It got a little annoying at times to have to figure out where exactly the next installation was starting out. Also, the book jacket said the story was told from several of the main character's points of view, but the only ones you really hear from are Ruth and Amanda.   I was pretty disappointed by the end of the story. The book starts out intriguing and makes you wonder if Amanda literally went off the deep end after all and killed her sister, or if it was in fact an accidental drowning. But by about halfway through, the facts become clear and are easy to interpret. Still, I hoped maybe I was wrong and the ending would surprise me after all. It didn't.  Carl also disappears about halfway through the book. It's due to a job he takes, but it felt like he was written out of the story because the author ran out of use for him, or wasn't sure what to do with him after a certain point. She spent a lot of time focusing on Carl's desire to learn about the truth of his wife's death.   As it was, he only found out part of the truth, and that was according to what Amanda got him to believe. Nevertheless, Carl accepted it at face value and after that he accepted his wife's fate. He was then written out of the story. I didn't really like that aspect of things and didn't think it meshed with everything else that was happening. Even though he wasn't a strong character in general, he's one of the characters I actually liked. Amanda wasn't that likeable at all, and was a pretty cold person who was obsessed with Ruth and still obsessed with the past. Ruth was somewhat pliable and easily molded to her aunt's bidding, even though she made some feeble attempts to be her own person.  I don't know if I'd read this author again. But I managed to find this book for $1.. and would say it was worth it and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, either on here or in a bookstore 
 As a big Steamroller fan, perhaps my hopes were set a little too high.  I envisioned more original music (perhaps a more scarier vibe than the silly one this CD has to it) and maybe a few covered tunes.  Chips originals (from the Fresh Aire series)found on this CD outshine the weak efforts put forth on the covered and rearranged tracks.  The sound effects disc sets a great(and creepy)mood, that should had been followed through with some new and equally scary compositions.    If you're a die hard Mannheim fan (as in 'I just have to own everything Chip puts out') I say go for it.  But otherwise spend your Halloween money elsewhere.  Overall this is a forced and lazy effort 
 Who is her editor?  The main character self-analyzes to the point of nausea. We got it. We do not need the author to explain to us what she is trying to say.  I felt, as the reader, that the author did not trust me to "get" her own work. It would have been a much better novel had she given her readers more credit. Not to mention, if she grew up in a cold family, with no experiences to open up her sexuality and sensuality, I did not buy that one boyfriend would all of a sudden be a panacea to a lifetime of suppression. 
 The thing that Hewitt wants most is to lead this country down the path of fascism. Don't join him. Would recommend staying away from these people. Read something intelligent like Chomsky. 
 I'm a little hesitant to write a review of this book as a male reader that does not gush with positive statements about it being an affirmation of the hardships women face (same would go if I were reviewing The Fear of Flying or A Room of One's Own, both of which are far superior to this outing, although of different genres), but I'll go ahead and write one anyways. Nafisi's account of her life and those of her female students during the past few troubling decades in Tehran didn't provide all of the insight that many have used to champion this work. Nor has she really provided any insights into the works that she uses nor many links between the relevance of these specific works with her students. I know I may get lambasted for saying so, but the memoir and literary criticism does not mesh together well and at no point do we get some semblance of true cohesion. Instead, we get pockets of reflections that come out slightly forced or too general. The layers of interpretation for a character such as Humbert is simplified to either he's a villian or a misunderstood villian, neither of which deals with many of the nuances Nabakov has included. You would expect more from someone who teaches these works if she wants to actually flesh out some of these ideas and the relevance and impact upon her students. The strongest parts of the text lie with her description of university life and the political complexities that emerge surrounding being a literature teacher educated in the West who comes back to Iran to teach. I think one of my problems was the way which the book is marketed as a celebration of sorts of the way literature is important within any context, yet the novel devolves into a simple description of the life of one brave English professor who stands up to the conservative regime and its attempts to curb access to certain books in the country. On a more stylistic level, I was slightly annoyed that the students she describes in the text, as much as she loves and cares for each of them and does try to differentiate them, actually become a massive blob without much indivuality. I had many problems picturing them and the way that they are different from one another. Her husband is also described more as a shadow than anythign else, even though he does play an important role, although a subtle one in many scenes. I think I expected a lot from this novel that I couldn't get from picking up a newspaper and I didn't get much beyond that. 
 The Alex Cross series by James Patterson started out incredibly strong with a couple of excellent novels to the start the series in "Along Came a Spider" and "Kiss the Girls."  These novels were truly exceptional when it came to being edge of the seat thrillers, page turners, and plot twisters.  They were a standard by which I and many others judged other novels in this genre.  As the Cross series continued, the quality of the novels began to decline.  For one, Cross is supposed to be a detective.  However, as this series has progressed, he has done less and less detective work.  He usually just follows leads until he happens upon the villain, and then Cross is praised as a major hero.  Second, the plot twists, for which this series use to be famous for, have become very contrived.  Instead of that "I can't believe I didn't see that coming feeling," or "man, was I fooled" sensation, the plot twists frequently leave me saying, "that was absolutely ridiculous."  Many of these very flaws have found their way into "Londond Bridges."  This novel picks up where "Big Bad Wolf" left off.  Some sort of Russian mad man has created a criminal empire, is capable of unspeakable cruelty, and has more criminal plans to execute.  Cross, formerly of the Washington P.D. and now with the FBI, has been tasked with tracking down the Wolf.  This novel, like the others in the series, switches back from first to third person story telling.  When the chapters focus on Cross, they frequently are told in first person from Cross's point of view.  When other characters are central to the storytelling, then the narrative switches to third person.    This is not necessarily a bad thing, but in the later chapters, the third person omniscient narrator lies to the reader!  To be clear, the narrarator doesn't provide clues and lets the reader jump to their own conclusion.  The narrator deliberately tells the reader something that isn't so.  Then, the narrator attempts to turn this into a plot twist a few pages later.  This is extremely aggravating.  Many, if not most, of the plot twists in this novel just come off flat.  To a certain degeree, you are left asking "who cares?" or thinking to yourself "he couldn't possibly thought he got him this time."  The redeeming quality of this book is that Patterson doesn't pull punches.  Several monuments, buildings, and bridges throughout the world are targetted by the Wolf.  Don't expect last second rescues.  In addition, Cross's personal life has more and more problems thrown at it.  The resolution of those problems doesn't happen easily, but at least Pattrson doesn't let Cross off easily.  My opinion is that perhaps Patterson has spread himself a little too thin across all his projects.  He just posted in his blog that he has five, and maybe six, novels to come out next year.  It appears the focus needed to make a great Cross novel is lacking.  I've heard good things about "Mary, Mary," the next novel in the series, so I suspect I will pick that one up.  However, it is potentially my last Cross, if not Patterson, novel.  Overall:  2.5 star 
 Published in the November 2006 issue of the UK journal Literary Review:  Ilan Pappe is an Israeli academic who has made his name by hating Israel and everything it stands for. In his view, expressed with obsession and a degree of paranoia, Jewish nationalism, that is to say Zionism, has been from its outset a deliberate tool for dispossessing the Palestinians; and therefore it is to be condemned root and branch. He reserves the Palestinian term of Nakba, meaning catastrophe, for describing what to Israelis is their war of independence of 1948. To him, Israeli politicians and soldiers, one and all, are so many murderers. Forests have been planted only to cover up the past. Houses are `monstrous villas and palaces for rich American Jews'. Everything Israeli is ugly, everything Palestinian is beautiful. One day, he supposes, the Israelis may well consummate their original crime with something even worse. The only possible alternative lies in the immediate return of every Palestinian to his original home, and that will mean the end of the state whose existence so offends Pappe. This, of course, is exactly the inflexible position taken by Hamas and the PLO.  The reader's initial reaction must be one of pity. Poor man! What a strain it must be to belong to a nation whose members are so overwhelmingly unbearable that he longs for them to be overpowered by others. Yet there is more to it than that. Sad and creepy though it is, Pappe's anger is open to rational analysis.  The doctrinal element pushing Pappe into anti-Zionism is his prominent involvement in the Israeli Communist Party, known as Hadash. An outcrop of pure Stalinism and always a marginal movement, Communism in Israel rejected Zionism in favour of internationalism, according to which Jews and Arabs were to form a state together. Events, indeed the whole thrust of history, have proven this to be a complete illusion, but Pappe remains one of a minute handful still in its grip.  The further emotional element pushing Pappe towards his hatred of Zionism is best elucidated by J L Talmon in his profound book, The Myth of the Nation and the Vision of Revolution. Among the `horribly charged and tormenting questions' Talmon asks is why so many Jews have adopted identities that seemingly allow them to deny their Jewishness. Uncountable numbers of Jews have followed the example of the Karl Marxes, Trotskys and Rosa Luxemburgs who sought identities as Communists and revolutionaries in the hope that this would allow them to merge with those who otherwise would be their persecutors. Some Communists - like Lazar Kaganovich, and many in the KGB as well as leaders in the Soviet satellites - set about the deliberate destruction of the Jewish religion and culture. Talmon speaks openly of the neurosis and `morbid masochism' motivating such unhappy people.  In Nazi Germany a few Jews tried to camouflage themselves in a similar manner. Felix Jacoby opened his Kiel University lectures in 1933 by comparing Hitler to the Emperor Augustus. Dr Hans-Joachim Schoeps and Max Naumann even formed a movement of Jews for Hitler. With gallows humour, other Jews replied that this movement's slogan was Raus mit Uns, or Out with Us. In Israel today, Neturei Karta, a sect of ultra-Orthodox Jews, believes that the Messiah alone should bring about a Jewish state, and that Israel is therefore an impiety fit for destruction. In New York they have a branch called Jews Against Zionism, and recently they welcomed President Ahmedinejad in person there, supporting his call for genocide in Israel. Pappe is the secular and political version of these sectarians. As often happens, extremists have come from opposing poles only to reach the same conclusion.  Zionism, in Pappe's conventional Marxist view, had nothing to do with the need for Jews to survive persecution by Europeans or Arabs, but was only a settler and colonialist movement cynically directed by British imperialists and their greedy Jewish collaborators. He characterises David Ben-Gurion, the driving personality in the latter stages of the foundation of the state of Israel, as someone who always intended to expel Palestinians from the land. To bring this about, he assembled a body which Pappe refers to as the Consultancy, but the details of who these people were, and what they really did, he fails to give us, instead preferring to conjure an aura of sinister conspiracy. The Israelis were always the stronger party and knew that they would win out at the end of the British Mandate in 1948, Pappe says. In contrast, the Palestinians were defenceless and hardly violent at all, designated victims whose villages were mercilessly overrun and many of the inhabitants butchered.  A huge literature exists in British, Arab and Israeli archives to reveal the multiple reasons for the flight of the Palestinians at the time, ranging from a belief that invading Arab armies were about to rescue them, and they should move out of harm's way, to a cultural reflex that they could not accept Jews in positions of authority, an escapism on the part of some leaders and delusions of power on the part of others, and of course fear. Savage things were certainly perpetrated by both sides - ï¿½ la guerre comme ï¿½ la guerre - but Pappe will have none of that, completely ignoring the context in all its complexity and local variation. His technique is to list towns and villages as though their capture involved always and only simple brutality and expulsion. No mention of the Jewish need to survive in an existential struggle in the aftermath of the Holocaust; no mention of the 6,000 Jews killed, which was 1 per cent of the population; no mention of Azzam Pasha of the Arab League promising a massacre of Jews on the scale of the Mongols; no mention of Arab radio propaganda and disinformation; no proper account of Arab military successes, brushing over Arab atrocities and the destruction of Jewish settlements; no mention of the countervailing expulsion and expropriation of a million Jews in Arab countries.  As history, the book is worthless. In interviews Pappe regularly explains: `We do [historiography] because of ideological reasons, not because we are truth seekers.' For him, as a Marxist and anti-nationalist, `there is no such thing as truth, only a collection of narratives'. To substantiate his particular ideological narrative, Pappe puts the worst possible interpretation on any Jewish deed or word, while validating anything said or done by Palestinians. For evidence of Israeli monstrosity, he relies on quotations from his own previous works or from Palestinian polemicists, and above all on the oral testimonies of Palestinian refugees. Over half a century of military and ideological conflict has passed since their exodus, but Pappe declares his faith that whatever they now say is true. This might all seem too pathological to matter much, but Arab and Muslim extremists are making huge efforts to contest the legitimacy of Israel, and many of their allies on the international Left will lean on Pappe for purposes of `pilgering' and `fisking'.  The final element contributing to Pappe's mindset lies in the sphere of psychology and fashion. Contemporary intellectuals have long been accustomed to glorying in an adversarial stance towards their own society, preening themselves as men of nobler spirits than the dull indifferent masses around them, and isolated not because they are foolish but because they are brave. It is a form of snobbery - moral snobbery - which is why intellectuals of this kind are so widely resented.  There is a fatal contradiction at the heart of Pappe's advocacy of the immediate return of all Palestinian refugees as the necessary condition of peace. If Israelis are really as vicious as Pappe presents them, then Palestinians could not possibly want to live among them. Are Palestinians to return only to wipe out Israelis or to be wiped out themselves? Poor Palestinians, poor Israelis, to be mobilised for such fates. And should Hamas, the PLO or President Ahmadinejad make good on threats to eliminate Israel, there will not be time to rescue Pappe from the consequences of his moral snobbery and his Marxism, or to discover whether he really applauds his own Raus mit Uns demise. 
 I wouldn't recommend this book 
 The book offers no rigor in any sense and the author seems to have simply copied a large number of formulas from a real probability book. Explanations are sparse and incoherent with vague references to "important applications" with no sense of the abstract concept and virtually no insight into any of the information presented; as another reviewer wrote it is quite dry, I can't see Ben Stein narrating it, but I can picture the author sitting at his keyboard haphazardly plunking in text from other 'sources' all the while wondering what it means.  Skip this and get something with more substance, Peebles offers nothing more than you could find on wikipedia, perhaps less 
 if you want your children to think that the"cure" for any problem, such as daydreaming, lack of energy or hyperactivity comes in a powder or a pill, then "Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle's Magic" is right up your alley.  if you believe in slipping mood-altering substances into your child's body is a good thing, here's your book.  if you think children's shortcomings should first be treated with love, avoid this book and the rest of the Piggle-Wiggle books, which treat children like mindless [kids] that parents must trick into good behavior 
 I just read _The DaVinci Code_ in less than 2 days.  I couldn't put it down.  It was fascinating.  Then, I put this DVD on and everyone in my family fell asleep!  I tried to keep them interested and have the DVD help explain some of the underlying theories that I found so interesting in Dan Brown's book, but the "expert" interviews were sloppy and not engaging.  When I switched to the extras, hoping to get some visuals on the sites mentioned in the book, the glimpses of Westminster Abbey and The Louvre were very brief while the Rosslyn Church segment made me nauseous with all the spinning camera work.  I wish they would have held still a little bit and let us LOOK at the place!    I have seen many good documentaries in my life, but this is definitely not one of them 
 I didn't like this book.  Truth be told, I still haven't finished it, and I bought it over six months ago.  The characters are boring; the situation (while ripe with potential) drags; and the recipes don't even sound good.  I am supremely disappointed, as I usually love what Nora Ephron does.  Bummer 
 I had to read this book for school and I also had to do a report for it, and I felt I was being tortured by having to read it.  Nothing interesting ever seems to happen in this book, therefore, I do not recommend this book  to anyone, especially to teachers looking to have there students read it.   To the teachers, I got a 100 percent on the test, because nothing  interesting happened in the book to ask a question about.  In closing, if  you are looking to read a book, i suggest you pick a different one, if  there was a zero star option I would have picked that 
 The best scene in the movie, the "I love the nightlife" disco scene has been edited and the music replaced with some lame tripe. It is painful to watch. They are completely out of step with the music and the song is really awful. Imagine the Godfather with the restaurant scene (where Michael gets the guys who hit his dad) edited out! It ruins the entire movie. Wait for it on cable and tape or Tivo it!      
 The shape conforms perfectly to the designer's hands, but unless you share the same DNA, I'd avoid this product. I've used many of these over the years and this is the only one I struggled with. Constantly shifting it to get it's high and low points in a place that was tolerable. I finally reversed it, pointing it towards me and it worked a little better. This just needs to be a simple pad. Instead, they've overdesigned it as a gimmick. 
 10 or 20 pages of nice graphs worth copying and keeping on your desk, otherwise really generic, should be kept for reading in the subwa 
 It's very good, and I only give it one star because my teacher ruined it for me.  She analyzed everything Arthur Miller wrote in it, whether the lights were to be dark, or bright, how he shift time, how the instruments played, believing symbols of all of them.  Contrary to Arthur Millers own statements which I printed out and gave to the class, that he didn't plan on anything, he just wrote.  Let people do with it what they do.  In that affect, the teacher took a great play, and ruined it with her ideas of what he meant.  
 I've enjoyed Melody Carlson's adult novels.  They tend to have realistic characters and give a far more complex, nuanced view of faith and the world than a lot of Christian fiction.  This novel disappointed me a great deal.  The characters are one-dimensional and the plot could not be more simplistic.  Basically, it boils down to this: don't have sex, because God's greatest concern with teenage girls is the state of their hymen (their actual one, or maybe, like Beanie, their spiritual hymen) rather than of their heart.  Perhaps the most insulting, disgusting part of the book is the final page where the fictional character in the book tries to urge readers to sign a chastity pledge.  Can you imagine how much better this world would be if young Christians were encouraged to pledge themselves to feed the hungry, comfort the afflicted, and visit the imprisoned, rather than to not have sex?  How wonderful it could be if their energy and passion were turned outward toward helping the "least of these"--the poor, the sick, the outcast, the people Jesus served--rather than inward toward perserving their "sexual purity"?  Unfortunately, that is not what's happening, and books like this are a part of the problem 
 This iw the worst book I have yet read.  While the concept of the Biography is enhanced by the plates and drawings, the foot notes don't correspond to the propper painting.  The facts of his life don't even go hand in hand with Leonardos notes on himself.  Other journalists and recorders of Leonardos time dictate him as being a marvelous genius in which all aspects of talent blossomed from his soul at some point in his life.  If this books had any basis in researched fact it would have been reviewed by the Museum of Science and Technology in Milan.  And by the National Historical Preservation Society and since it has not been,. Anyone interested in - da Vinci, read for yourselves from the masters own hand writing, even if in translation.  This book a pathetic fallacy on a great man 
 Reading this book was like reading a soap opera script. Nothing happened, the same events were rehashed over and over and everything is revealed through a secret window the reader has into the thoughts of the characters. The story was weak, the characters far worse and the premise completely ridiculous. Why would any woman, depressed or otherwise, allow their 11-year-old daughter to continue a strange friendship with a strange older man she met on the beach? Implausible. Especially for someone who has lost all her loved ones, to even take the chance with the daughter being lost, insane. Danielle Steel is a terrible writer, that is if she even writes these books anymore. Poor writing, poor editing...what a waste of my time 
 This book will sucker you, and I don't mean that in a good way. It starts out as a hard-nosed, nicely-written discussion of what it means to help someone and the rewards and troubles that may ensue. The first half of the book presents a number-but not as many as the jacket blurbs would have you believe-of the philosophical conundrums of giving and receiving help; as a one-time teacher and recently-retired minister the author has had lots of personal and practical experience in the area. Then about halfway through the screen of objectivity starts to slip and the author's radical leftist colors begin peeking out here and there. By the last third of the book the text has become a confused, softheaded 'social liberation theory' polemic for some sort of a semi-Marxist utopia where, I guess, everyone devotes his or her existence to helping each other. This may be fine if you already believe that sort of thing, but the argument isn't convincing and to a more neutral reader it comes off like a rant. Heaven help the conservative who stumbles on this piece of work; the author has no help (or compassion) for him or her. Which is too bad because the original topic-the paradox of help-is worthy of any amount of reasoned discussion, and the author's nice writing (if you discount the usual self-centered boomer "I this... and I that..." style) draws you in. But the journey doesn't go to its advertised destintation, and I'd say spend your time and money elsewhere. 
 This book of the disintegration of Jugoslavia is very detailed, nicely organized, and easy to read one. It covers the step-by-step death of Jugoslavia, and like many reviewers I found biases dragging all over the book as if the Muslims are saints and the Serbs devils. The blame on Milosevic is constant, but the blame of Tudjman does not exist. How good or bad Milosevic is/was, it was designed and decided by the USA and the Western Europe-same like in Irag, with once Western darling Saddam Hussein and suddenly the evil, the demon. The ethnic differences in Jugoslavia were created and provoked by the USA and the Western Europe ONLY by corrupting the Balkans governments in search for more markets for their collapsing empires and places for their oil tubes for their SUV's and poluted fat ways of living.  
 From the Playboy pics, it looks like she is on steroids, too. Trophy wife, but aren't trophies made of plastic 
 Having seen Dead Man Walking, I became interested in seeing more movies about the death penalty so I got a hold of this movie.... I hated it.  The acting was corny and cheesy.  Sean Penn's performance as a condemned  prisoner facing imminent execution was vastly superior and definitely more  convincing than Sharon Stone's.  It beats me why this movie was released  shortly after Dead Man Walking.  In fact, it beats me why it was released  at all.  Stick to Dead Man....don't bother with this extremely lame ripoff 
 A catalyst for the civil war, Uncle Tom's Cabin gives vivid details on the living conditions of the black slaves. The book's literary worth lies in the fact that people can make a difference by speaking out, and by preserving a kind of fictional history of the African American's pain, despite being redundant, rube and rife with tautology. The story is about Tom, a slave who saves his master's daughter and is promised his freedom. But his master dies before Tom is actually freed. The family falls upon hard times and Tom is sold to a horrible slave owner named Simon Legree. Legree tried everything to degrade Tom, but Tom holds firmly to his religious convictions. 
   Beware!  If you read this book, know that it misrepresents the Minoans terribly.    Let's begin with the cover.  The vast majority of humans depicted in Minoan art are women.  Furthermore, for every man shown in a (possible) leadership position, there are thirty Minoan women shown in such positions.  Most scholars concede that the political leader of the Minoans could very well have been a woman.  So what does Castleden plaster on the front of his book?  Not only a man, but the only male figure that's ever been suggested as a remotely  possible leader. If this isn't blatant dishonesty of the worst kind, I don't know what is.    And who is Castleden, anyway?  I've looked high and low, and can't find credentials for him.  There are none listed in (or on) his book.  He isn't an archaeologist.  He doesn't seem to be a scientist or academic. He doesn't seem to have any training in anything.  Did he even graduate from high school?  If so, no one's saying.  As the Library Journal reviewer above points out, Castleden spends quite a bit of time blasting "traditional" theories about the Minoans.  In his mind, almost every "traditional" theory is a "wrong" theory.  But as the the LJ reviewer also notes, Castleden offers little or no evidence to support his "new and improved" theories.    Take for example the Anemospilia data.  Not every archaeologist agrees that "human sacrifice" happened at this Minoan site.  Yet Castleden assures us that he KNOWS it did, and, furthermore, that this translates into the Minoans generally practicing human sacrifice (!)  He knows they did, by golly!  He, the "expert" with the mystery credentials, tells us point blank that "the archaeological evidence is not susceptible of any other interpretation" (p. 171, 1994 edn).  Excuse me, Mr. C., but have you read the imminent archaeologist Nanno Marinatos?!?  No?  I thought not.  Marinatos gives that "other interpretation" you so haughtily assure us does not exist.     And then there's war.  The traditional view is that the Minoans maintained peace for 1000 years unbroken.  So of course Mr. C. knows this has to be wrong.  Again Mr. C. refrains from mentioning that not all experts (of which he is not one) agree with him here.  He passes the Minoans off as confirmed warriors (in certain time periods at least), and himself as one with the credentials to know.    I wholeheartedly agree with the Library Journal reviewer: "Castleden frequently proposes scenarios drawn more from psychosocial inference than evidence, yielding arguments less compelling than the originals. A nation of addicts could scarcely have had the energy to execute drug-induced creativity, much less to develop the commercial empire that was ancient Crete under the Minoans...."    Lastly, nothing in this book is referenced -- the first mark of an insecure amateur.    We are forced to rely on Castleden's honesty and integrity about almost every thing he says.  And we've already seen that his honesty is questionable.    
 The concept of "Rumspringa," in which some of the world's most conservative people run wilder than most of us ever do, is fascinating.  Then why is _Devil's Playground_ so boring?  The beginning is amazing, when we get our first glimpse at the debauchery of an Amish youth party.    The rest of the film, unfortunately, is pure tedium, as the filmmakers focus on a few kids who stray rather far into drugs and other vices, but who just aren't very interesting.    One in particular, a crystal meth dealer and user, gets endless attention, and we just see him ramble about nothing much for minute after minute.  The fact that he was formerly Amish does not make his pathetic life much more interesting than that of the next white trash loser.  Another Amish drop-out is a girl who appears to have serious emotional problems and who decides to go to college.  That is all I learned about her in the movie, and it could have been conveyed in about 30 to 60 seconds.  Instead, the director goes back to the girl again and again to pad out the film's running time, even though she has nothing additional to tell us.  Meanwhile, we are not given much context for any of this.  Do most Amish kids stray this far before coming back?  Do some not stray at all?  Do the adults really just sit idly by for all of it?  After seeing this movie, I have no idea--I just know about a few kids who fell pretty far from the tree, and who aren't very interesting in themselves.  It seems many of the Amish shown here do not reflect typical Amish/Mennonite ethnic traits, which goes unexplained.  It is also clear that some of the Amish people we see, including the adults who allowed themselves to be interviewed on camera, are from substantially different Amish sects.  So does this stuff go on among all the Amish, or just in some weird group of Amish, or what?  The film never explains.    Other things irritate, such as use of the same soundtrack music over and over.  Why the filmmaker thought the electronic music of Aphex Twin was the best choice to represent the "unplugged" world of the Amish, I don't know.    The footage in this film could have been used to make an interesting 15-minute news magazine segment.  It does not work as a (barely) feature length documentary 
 I was very dissapointed when I watched A Bing Crosby Christmas.  There was very little of his old Christmas shows and a lot of stuff I didn't care to see.  If I had wanted a biography on Bing Crosby I would have ordered a biography.  I would send this DVD back if I could...don't waste your money on it 
 I'm a hardcore B.G. fan.  I'll copp anything from lil whoadie. Is this first cd of B.G. you are consdering buying?   STOP!!!  Go back to the previous cds...get "Checkmate" for your first B.G. purchase.  Then purchase backwards until u buy "True Story".  THEN get "Heart of the Streets".   Too many of the beats here suck.  Its just pitiful...maybe people in the N.O. like that BS.    At last B.G. is workin with Mannie fresh again...i'm waitin on that "It's All on U Vol.3 
 The book jacket of this novel describes it "as the authoritative biography of one of the most fabled women of the century". I would describe this novel as an attempt to delve into the psyche of the most fabled woman of the century.  Sally Bedell Smith, the author worked at TV Guide and The New York Times, where she was a cultural-news reporter. She joined Vanity Fair as a contributing editor in 1996. She was awarded a Sigma Delta Chi Distinguished Service Award for magazine reporting in 1982, and she was a fellow at the Freedom Forum Media Studies Center in 1986. She has written several books of famous people, the Kennedy's, William Paley and Pamela Churchill Harriman.  Diana, Price of Wales died traumatically in 1997 in Paris. We all watched her funeral and the clip after clip of her automobile accident.  We have heard and read every story about Diana, and all of the numerous TV movies and films made about her. However, it is not until this book, have I seen her diagnosed with a mental illness without benefit of a physician and psychiatrist, but with only the words of friends and acquaintances. Ms Bedell Smith says that Diana suffered from a borderline personality disorder. That is such a generalized term that can describe each one of us at certain times in our life. Certainly, Diana had her problems, her bulimia, shyness, lack of ego and insecurity. But this young woman was thrust into the middle of a dysfunctional royal family with no mentor and it appears little love and support.  Who knows what the real story was or what Diana could have made of her life. She left behind two young men to carry on her name in the royal tradition.  The author attempts to diagnose and describe Diana by the symptoms she showed the world in the most unrealistic of environments.  I prefer to remember the Diana of charity and good works and beloved by her countrymen.  This book does not provide the evidence needed to prescribe or diagnose Diana. Let us leave her alone. The people of the United Kingdom will revere her as we all did at one time.   prisrob 
 I've always admired Norman Cantor as a historian.  However, this book is terrible.  It is scattered--I could never tell what was coming next or how ideas fit together.  It is repetitious--giving the same general fact or opinion over and over again, as if the author couldn't remember what he'd already said or had no idea of organization.  It is vague--rarely does he get into the specific details we know of Gaunt's life that would give us a true flavor of the times.  The all too brief section on Gaunt's registers was one of the few interesting sections of the book.  A waste of my time and money 
 Though I found this book full of facts and a great look into their lives, the Author is very repetitive in his writing.  He repeats himself to the point of annoyance.  There are paragraphs that are rewritten two to three times in a few chapters.  If you can get past this, check it out.  If it irritates you like it does me, find another title about them 
 This is the first book I've not been able to put down - not because it was so riveting, but because I couldn't wait to be done with it. It reads like a grocery list of domestic issues that might be intriguing for an adolescent or, perhaps, for someone who has never left their small town and dreams of the dramas that they assume lie in the big city. The themes, problems and experiences of the Stassos family are so completely generic that, should the book be interpreted into any visual form, it would take the shape of the most heavy-handed after-school special ever made!  And as for the "poetic" prose that is attributed to this novel: the use of language is over-the-top and often pretencious. Many experiences are not simply stated, but are rather coated with words that only add weight rather than description or meaning.   One example that I underlined: "'I'm always careful,' Ben said, in exactly the spirit he would toss a too-small offering -- a hibiscus blossom, a pomegranate -- into a crater." WHAT?!!!  Granted, the context is missing, but even in the context, this quote made me laugh. And by the time i came to the last third of book, the laughter was all that got me though to the end (that, and the fact that I had to finish it because I told someone that I would.)  If I could give this book less than one star, I would.  
 This is old and not a very professionally produced product "As The presenter states" at the beginning. Sorry but for the price, it's definately not worth the money. A big F+!! 
 I basically agree with the reviewer who said this book is largely an "info-mercial", BUT the PsychK course itself is something I would recommend.  It is a simple & safe way to change belief systems, without the arduous (& often ineffective) methods of talk therapy.  The DVD Psychology of Change demonstrates one PsychK balancing technique and it's possible, as another reviewer indicated, that it may work for you, but the PsychK Workshop will provide other methods to use when that one does NOT work, as well as other practical information.  Skip the book & go to the Workshop 
 My daughter had her Tamagotchi V4 for about a day when the screen didn't work anymore.  At first we thought it was the batteries but once we changed them I knew that wasn't the problem.  It would beep and make noise but you couldn't see anything in the screen 
  In the post 9/11 world in which this book, subtitled "The Clash Between Islam and Modernity in the Middle East" was published, it should not be surprising that the reader would anticipate a discussion of the factors that led up to that awful day. This, however, is not to be found in What Went Wrong?  Instead we are treated to a cerebral discussion of various and sundry esoteric minutiae. We learn, for instance, that, "A distinguishing characteristic of Western music is polyphony, by harmony or counterpoint. This begins in its simplest form with the choir, in which matched voices sing different notes in a planned sequence to produce a combined effect; then comes the keyboard instrument, matching the ten fingers of the two hands, following different routes in a common purpose; and finally, the musical ensemble, from duets and trios to the full orchestra". While this is all well and good, and may even be mildly interesting on some academic level, it is hard to understand how it plays into a discussion of "The Clash Between Islam and Modernity..." that has led to the precarious times in which we live.  Or, on another note (harmony? counterpoint?) we learn that Robinson Crusoe was translated into Arabic by Butrus al-Bustani and published in the late 1850's. Big deal!  What we don't learn anything about is the rise of militant Islamism. There is no mention of Wahhabism or how this fundamentalist Islamic movement contributed to the rejection of modernity. The Muslim Brotherhood also is not to be found in the index, nor is there a mention of Sayyid Qutb, or his writing of the incendiary manifesto, Milestones. Furthermore, there is not a single reference to al-Qaeda, though Usama bin Laden does appear, albeit seemingly as an afterthought, in what appears to be a hastily added Afterword.  So what went wrong?  Beats me.. 
 Disney, just about the worst company on Earth, has many lines of magazines. This is just used to suck even more money, even though they already have so much money that they're kids drown to death in money. Then disney goes on to cancel Dave the Barbarian and Teacher's Pet, the only good Disney shows 
 To begin with, we really don't need this kind of book, nor do we need those written by the Neo-Fats who wish to blame America for everything since Columbus sailed in 1492.  Does that mean that Mr. Prestowitz might have a point here and there? Possibly. But when the majority of the baby butchers of 9/11 were born to prosperous families like the Atta scum (daddy Atta blames America for his son's murderous tendencies) - or families like that of Vicente Fox that prospered thanks to America, to Coca-Cola, McDonalds, Starbucks and all of those evil American corporations, and still blame America for their poor campesinos (remember, Clyde, you were a trade representative), then I for one refuse to buy into this kind of fallacious argument.  Should Americans understand the world? Absolutely. Should we buy into their Hate America crapola. Not for one single second. If we do, then I will ask Mr. Prestowitz and "Compassionate Conservative" who blames an Israel for the Palestinians wanting to butcher women and children, - an Israel that recently smashed the homes of its own citizens instead of the PLO leaders, where they happen to reside. Because more than likely they live on Native American land that was taken by force. If so, kindly hand over the keys to the local Tribal council, dear sirs, and take your family back to Europe. I'm sure Clyde can find an ancestral home in Cracow or Lodz or Warsaw.  We are NOT a "rogue nation" nor should we carry a guilt trip about Kyoto, the Israelis, SAVAK, the division of Korea or any other tripe that Prestowitz or his similiar-minded friends on the Left wish for us to carry, namely Soros, Chomsky and Zinn. Thousands of American boys and girls laying beneath the soil in North Africa, Western Europe, the Pacific Islands have already paid the world's price. Not to mention those who have died in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. And if the masses of the world don't like it, too bad.  Seems Mr. Prestowitz didn't learn much from serving in the administration of a great American President. Care to blame him too, Clyde?  My Country, Right or Wrong - it does have a very nice ring to it. 
 I thought the title was interesting so I bought this book.  Wow, what a disappointment.  This is sappy and poorly written.  How does Mitch Albom keep  getting on the best sellers list 
 2 1/2  Competent though disappointing, this highly referenced trance album cannot escape it's plodding, dated backbone of a beat, no matter how refined and professional the production tries to be. Of course, listening to the album 13 years later, one immediately feels the bland, aged thump soaked into the generic sequencing and tonality, which is not to say the album was not worthy of the praise it garnered upon release-in House-centric circles that is. The thudding, ever present, 4/4 layering of a pulse that guides entirely too much mainstream electronic music out there will vastly undermine any of the dreamy atmosphere heavily present on this ambitious little club-hopper, rendering most of the Yanni-with-edge keyboard melodies banal. Thankfully once in a while, particularly at the start and finish of the disc, a semi-potent spell is afforded these static conditions, allowing Dreamland to shine in refreshingly unrestricted ways 
 There are some things in life that simply cannot be taught 
 Nothing is wrong with `Trauma' as far as the actors and technical aspects are concerned. Colin Firth shows compelling acting as the suffering protagonist who survived a car accident, and John Mathieson's noir-ish cinematography is simply riveting. Except that, however, `Trauma' is likely to leave most audiences only puzzled and unsatisfied after the end credits roll. As for the film itself, it goes on and on without giving me during its course any sense of mystery, drama, character study, or whatever that is worth spending my time.  Colin Firth plays Ben, who wakes up from a coma that lasted one week after his car crash that killed his wife Elisa (Naomie Harris, '28 Days Later'). In spite of the constant therapy and the presence of a lovely girl named Charlotte (Mena Suvari), Ben's mental condition gets worse and worse, and he begins to suspect that what he sees and remembers does not necessarily reflect the reality that everyone else shares. In addition to the premise that is no longer original, the film introduces a murder case of internationally famous actress (or singer ... sorry I forgot which) that does not convince me at all. And the most surprising thing is, Ben might be the prime suspect of the murder! But how? and why?  The script is laden with so many bits that do not simply gel - beside the things I pointed out above, Ben must meet a seer (played by Brenda Fricker) who says something very predictable, and his estranged sister who is just forgettable. There are also big red ants crawling all over, paintings that imply nothing special, and the CCTV surveillance images that only remind that the film is set in UK. All these gimmicks are used in the short films directed by film school students. The difference is, probably they know what they are doing better.  I simply detest the ending that only wants to be shocking (which it is not), and sincerely wish that Mena Suvari find a new agent who can help her out of the string of bad career choices that are getting more and more serious damages to her career these days 
 When will MTV learn? and when will anyone ever come to reality? Who in the world told this child that she could sing? She can't! Yes I agree totally with someone on this review the girl is just as nasally as I am when my sinusis are backed up. My cat can sing better then that...  Heck why not let me do a reality show you don't have to know how to sing all you need is just a pretty face. And that sums her up in a shampoo bottle.  She's young, pretty, petite, and talentless.  I say CAN Cheyenne! 
 Returned the book. Started to read the book but within the first cou0ple of pages couldn't get past the word-jams and author's long convoluted sentence structure 
 The only great thing about "The Great Fire" is its name.  This is one of those books that as you read it, you find yourself lost in thoughts about the morning commute, the long ago expired and still unpaid decal on your front windshield, about the dog, that you forgot to feed and you now know it repaid you by doing its business on the one spot of the carpet, which you fiercely guarded and hoped to protect before the weekend party with your boss and his pricy wife who for some time now has been...but then you collect your thoughts and try again to refocus your attention on this story of post war Japan and the Australian soldier who fell in love with a teenager, or was the chap British...and the she, the bosses wife, who strangely winked at you during the last Christmas party and you felt like choking...he must have been Australian since in the end he decided to stay with the girl in Australia...but now you know that the spot in the carpet would forever remain brownish with its if not putrid then at least nagging reminder of the day you forgot to feed the damn dog because the book you were tying to read...but who really cares whether the Australian and the teenager remained faithful to each other, after all the world really changed since 1947...and so you hope that the next paycheck would be enough for you to make a call to `Stanley Steamer' and have them fix the memory of your immoral transgression...But back to the book! If you love British style novels of the kind where old ladies and younger chaps (with names like Bertram and Aldred) get together to have some tea, then in their spare time write long romantic letters, and from time to time remind each other of the horrid world war 2, this is the book for you. If you are like me, meaning you have so much on your mind that it'd take a much stronger novel to keep your attention pinned to its pages, then I highly recommend you withhold the urge to read this one.   - by Simon Cleveland 
 I was disappointed with this purchase.  "Vaxxine" got me excited for this disc, but sadly, the remaining songs don't compare to the fire of the lead track.  Mid-way through the CD I find myself very bored by the uninspired chugga-chugga guitar riffs. On the brighter side, the vocal harmonies are a plus 
 I ordered two 4 gb mini flash drives. One of them arrived DOA (dead on arrival. I have emailed the person who sold this product with no response. I would say that the seller does not warranty any equipment. If you bought it you own it. Not the way I like to do business 
 I bought this card based on its capability of range and speed.  When I first bought it, it lived up to its promise.  I got great range and speed out of the card.  I could go waaaaaaaaaaay across the yard and surf the internet at blazing speed with no problems. It could go through two floors, a few walls, concrete, etc. without any issues.  Like Superman.  Life was good.  After a few months I noticed the card started to "hang".  I thought it had something to do with my p.o.s. laptop, so I would just reboot and live with it.  Another month goes by, and I notice that the card is not very stable.  It stops working after about 30 minutes, but it seems to work just great at Panera for unlimited time.  I once again chalk it up to my cheap computer.  Now, after 4 months total, the card barely works anywhere.  It gets very hot when using it, and I am lucky to get 5 minutes out of it, at Panera or anywhere else.  I tried it in another computer, same problem.  I wasted $[...], and now I am using a 3 year old slower Netgear card.  But guess what? It works.  If you are wealthy, buy 10 of these cards and just throw them out as they fail (they work GREAT for about 2 months).  Otherwise, keep shopping 
 I remember that I thought, at times, that American news shows would do better if they watched BBC or listened to NPR. I simply couldn't find what I wanted to know (i have to confess I skipped a good chunck; i couldn't take it) such as an answer to "Why all the major broadcasting stations chose to use certain words in reporpting the incidents in middle east, war on terror, war o/[i]n iraq, etc? (I still don't know when it actually became a war, in terms of the offical U.S. forein policy). The U.S. disregarding the U.N.'s inspection/judgement was enough at least for some of us to doubt any yet-coming-out proof of existence of WMD's. It is a piece of news, indeed informative one, if we hear a simple truth like it's too risky for reporters to go into certain regions and don't really know what's going on there or the U.S. goverment didn't allow reporters to go to certain areas, etc. Again, some of us figured anyway because we never heard iraqis talk on TV--even now we do rarely on radio (to tell you the truth i haven't had a TV for a long time). I believe that the american media didn't fail to inform the public what they knew, but they failed to inform that they didn't/couldn't know. Chomsky, though i often find myself disagree with him, is better---by far 
 I love Koontz but this book fell far from the mark.  It started off slow and I found myself thinking, "Where is this going?"  And, in the end, I felt it took me nowhere.  And, the T.S. Elliott quotes got a little annoying.  If you're a fan like me, I know you'll read it despite this review but if you're a first-time Koontz reader, don't start with this book.  It is definitely not his best work - try Odd Thomas or even (going way back here) The Funhouse instead 
 Though I love his show, this book does not seem to have the outstanding qualities I expect from Jeff Smith.  You would be better advised to purchase his "Frugal Gourmet Cooks American".  THAT one is a treasure 
 I knocked this book from someone that ordered it, but got to the store after me :-).  I made the mistake to buy the book by the sound of its title.  And author.  I fell for it this time..... It is not the first Konstantinos text I buy and must say, this one helped me make up my mind.  It seems highly obvious that the author is abusing the commercial value of the "black arts" to get to the spectrum of rebellious teenagers that would "sell their soul" just to make a statement at large.  Well well, if that aren't following the routes of the christian church we so dire to critisize.... The practical aspects are not well thought through and I suspect, just as unknown to the author as to the guys that made the front page.  Practise is either made as difficult as possible, or serves as an example of the inability of the author to explain some basic concepts. It does show that the author is jack of all trades, but master of none. I would advise readers that are seriously interested in the topic to acquire the texts of Frater U.D., which I find much more fascinating, as well as educational.  I would therefore advise this text for any pseudo-black-art-wannabe with little interest in the occult.  
 If you are a expecting a book with information this is not the product for you.  However, if you are expecting a disc with many NCLEX style questions this product could be useful.  I was wanting a review type book to augment my maternal-neonatal nursing class.  I plan on keeping this product for future NCLEX review but it is not helpful for the typical student 
 I saw on the cover it said something about the New York Times bestseller list, so I kept reading (for a while) since I thought it must have something good in it to get on the list.  Well, it never did!  It's just a bunch of ridiculous long-winded drivel that couldn't get to the point.  The author dragged out the most boring unimportant acts for pages upon pages upon pages, and nothing ever happens.  The LONG descriptions are of something like Val whining ad nauseum how she doesn't want to go to this memorial service, or Jake acting crabby on the plane, or how Val sat around for hours looking at Tony's picture in her apartment, etc.  Anyway, I don't know how it got on the NY Times list, that's for sure 
 Okay, now, I know that I am in the minority here. But...I really did not like this book at all.  Not because it wasn't about 'spells,' because that's not why I bought it. But, because it seemed so full of contempt, just plain arrogance & 'meaness' (and this from a man who'd queried, 'Where's the love in Wicca' in a later text, yet seems to be unable to demonstarte it himself; hypocracy is unbecoming, especially when it only serves the Anti-Fluffy Fundie fringe, allowing them to pat themselves on their back).  He left me feeling, which gives me pause for the concern of other self-identified Wiccans, that if you don't believe as A.J. does than you are really fooling yourself and are not 'a real Wiccan' (eg., a 'playgan').  And, that is why I so strongly object to this particular book.  He fills this book with insults such as calling people 'gullible,' 'simpletons,' and saying that if they believe a certain Wiccan 'tenets' that they 'must have checked their reality at the door' (sic.)  He presumes that various common Traditional Wiccan beliefs are not Wiccan at all!  A.J. also makes a number of factual errors which could result in the loss of businesses whom sell either real Musk Oil or Strawberry Oil (perhaps Pagan owned & operated; it is also note worthy that he owns his own Pagan supply store!).  He states that Musk Oil involves the killing of an animal, and I know to be false (it is no longer mandatory that the animal be harmed).  Although, cosmetic companies have since replaced authentic Musk Oil in their products with Musk Ambrette Oil, which bears a similar scent (and is just as expensive).  He also warns his readers to avoid sellers which sell real Strawberry Oil, because, as he tells it, there is no such thing. This is also false!  Strawberry Oil is pressed from the skins and seeds of strawberries (though it may not necessarily smell like 'strawberries').  He even backs up one of his claims that it's alright to perform manipulative magick (regardless) using one of Scott Cunningham's incense recipes: Business Incense (which can be found on page 61 of Scott's "Complete Book of Incense, Oils & Brews"), because 'the sense of smell is connected to the brain,' saying that Scott wrote that this incense is to be smoldered near an open window to attract customers.  Well, this statement is entirely false, as Scott Cunningham never included such an 'instruction' in his brilliant book.  I checked this out for myself, as it sounded odd to me that I didn't recall reading such a direct instruction in Cunningham's book, or I would have surely remembered it.   Over all, this book seemed incredibly belligerent, which is quite a divorce from his previous book ("Wicca For Men"). I don't understand it, myself!  And, I really didn't mind his last book, even though it was a bit dry.  But, there's nothing wrong with that!  However, there's absolutely no need for such name-calling, and a book on spiritual practices certainly is not the place for them, IMNSHO.  Be well, and take this review for what it's woth, just a review after having read this particular book. I was absolutely upset when I read all of nasty words that were being thrown around. Granted, I will fight for freedom of speach until my dying breath, but...he could have DEFINATELY written this book without all the insults!!!  SERIOUSLY!!!  He could have gotten his point accross completely unaided by such words as "simpletons," and much worse...  So, please, take heart.  You know, it's just like he's really trying to make his grandparents suck eggs, and in a sort of defaming way (I've even heard that in his book regarding couples, he'd went about scathingly airing the Farrars' private business, and defaming Ray Buckland severely out-dated facts)!  Highly unbecoming, imho...  But, I skimmed through one of his titles, one day, and he'd dedicated it to his Goddess, Eris.  And...looking back over his attitude and writings, his behaviour kinda' makes a little more sense, now!  *shrugs*  Though, this far from any sort of excuse, in the LEAST!  Furthermore, it seems like he's purposely being controversial just to sell a product 
 Let me first say that I am an unlikely reviewer to be so hostile to this type of book; I am extremely committed to healthy food choices, environmentally sound policies, and all the basic values Gary Null ostensibly embraces.  I have no problem with Null's basic premise that we should consume a fresh, non-processed, plant-based diet(although some studies have concluded that those who supplement their food with some fish and dairy products are healthier), buy organic food when at all possible, and avoid toxic household products.  But I am totally outraged by Gary Null's voodoo nutrition approach to these legitimate issues.  I bought the book and promptly returned it because it was so filled with woozy-new age drivel and devoid of reliable references to support the more controversial points.  We don't need any more evidence that a plant-based diet low in trans-fats is healthier than eating at McDonalds.  This book adds NOTHING legitimate to the basic health information you can obtain from any reliable print or internet source, and is far inferior to, for instance, "The Food Pharmacy" by Jean Carper, in which virtually every statement of fact is supported by one or more scientific references.  Save your money and buy some nice fresh organic produce 
 I used to own this cd and I thought it was absolutely groundbreaking and a wonderfully creative release from Mike Patton and Co.  However, I just bought Torture Garden by Naked City.  The fact is, Naked City was doing this exact same stuff over 10 years ago!  I could not believe that art like this came out back then!  Don't get this cd, it is Patton ripping off John Zorn's brilliance.  Get Torture Garden instead.  It is much more daring for its age and actually just sounds much better, fuller.  Mike Patton is mosly ridding the inspirations of other artists 
 This is another love fluke set in a sci-fi enviroment for the sake of thrill. It would've been better, maybe, if it would've kept to the normal decor... Humans colonized an alien leftover planet, then were cut off from earth. They managed to survive and develop a sixth sense.  Most of them are ghost-hunters or "tanglers", able to spring psychic traps left in the alien ruins. Lydia Smith is a tangler who has to find an ancient heirloom of Emmet London's. She's ready for a love affair and he's the right guy , in the right place. Love affair unfolds. Some things happen. Emmet is searching for a missing nephew. Lydia stumbles upon him. Then everything ends happily. Stupid book, stupid plot. Not recommended.

 The only reason I finished "The Transit of Venus" was the hope of any improvement.  This book took away two hours of my life-two hours that I can never earn back by reading true literature.  The story (is there a story?) is dreadful.  The sentence structures, the paragraph performances, the offered descriptions assist in one wondering if Ms. Hazzard is merely attempting to impress the audience with her self-perceived insights.  I will never recommend this book to any audience.  Ms. Hazzard and her publisher should refund my money 
 This one is for you.  But honestly now, the guy doesn't write--beautiful voice--but songwriting is a major appeal.  So  guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above Justin Timberlake.  Ok, there are definitely highlihgts like a Heart in Newyork, (what a) wonderful world, but generally this a very casual compilation, good for a couple listens.  in general, Art Garfunkel isn't really good for more than that.  Check out him witht Paul Simon, that is amazing stuff, but this is kinda boring.  I might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs--but even though there are good songwriters writing for him, the songs are still sub-par 
 I don't feel that Miller made much of an attempt to prove that Anna was in fact a "good" mother. Like another reviewer said, I don't think she was a BAD mother, but the book really didn't go into much detail about Anna's relationship with Molly (especially up until Anna' ex-husband filed for custody) and instead focused on Anna's life experiences and psyche. After Brian said he wouldn't send Molly back, Anna didn't even seem that concerned about Molly's mental and emotional well-being. She just focused on her notion that Leo's actions were simply taken out of context, and while she wanted to see Molly again, I got the impression that it was based on a selfish concern for her "rights" as a mother, not out of a concern for her daughter.   And what was so great about Leo anyway?? He wasn't exactly nice to Anna, often condescending to her, and from the beginning I felt that his affection for Molly was a farse, simply to stay on Anna's good side. He also seemed sexually possessive of Anna--like the scene when he kept having sex with her after Molly came into the bed because of a nightmare. I think Anna loved her daughter, but she made the error of confusing sexual attraction with true love, since she had never felt such an attraction before. As a result, her daughter became an afterthought to someone she had known for 2 months, with dire consequences. Although she did show some signs of remorse, she spent a large amount of time trying to justify her actions instead of showing a very deep concern for her daughter's welfare. If she had put her daughter first from the beginning, instead of being swept up into a sexual frenzy and creating illusions about the new "family" she and Leo were forming, then she probably never would have lost custody of her child. 
 Normally, I am very open to listening to new music -especially scenster/indie-hop - and when, months ago now, I'd heard about the Bravery I was intrigued. I turned on the radio here in San Francisco to the best indie station on the planet and kept my ears open. I remember hearing a song and thinking, "wow, the Strokes' new song is amazingly good." Then, when the announcer stated that the song was in fact performed by The Bravery, I was horrified.   Simply stated: how are these guys NOT the Strokes? Sorry, but they sound exactly like them... but not as good. Lyrically, they are not as original and the lead singer does not have the same passion or enthusiasm in his voice as the lead singer for the Strokes.   However, lucky for the Bravery, people are actually buying that they are a unique and catchy band. What a joke 
 Don't waste your time on this thing until they fix the bugs. We bought the Bratz one & it thought it was a Pawz when we took it online. After 10 or so total hours (Yes, I know what I'm doing) fighting it I gave up & took it back. Tech support is a joke. There's NOTHING in the manual or online help, only a link to tech support who sends the exact same auto response every time, and none of those responses addresses the issue. 
 This book is a mish-mash of new-age concepts. Here's a new-age quote from the book: "You only need to look within to find the best self undiscovered."  This is not a reliable guide to Confucianism. If you are interested in seeing how to apply Confucianism in your life I recommend another book: "Achieve Lasting Happiness, Timeless Secrets to Transform Your Life" by Robert Canright 
 I purchased the gold filter to go with the Krups FMF5 10-cup programamable coffeemaker - since on Amazon, it was something that people purchasing the coffeemaker were also buying. I hadn't had anything but a "paper filter" coffeemaker before. Anyhow, this filter does NOT FIT inside the filter holder on the Krups FMF5 10-cup programamable coffeemaker. Paper is the only option for you. 
 "The Skin I'm In" is fabulous, but I don't think this lives up to it at all. The first third of Bang! is an excellent evocation of a family and a neighborhood in decline.   After that, the book itself declines into unbelievable, author-directed silliness. Even if everything that happens to Mann after his father abandons him in the country is taken at face value, I find it impossible to believe that for a whole month no family member and no person in authority thought to look for the boy at the stable where he loved to go daily. A stable that became convienently empty just in time for him to move into it.   And to call the child Mann when the whole book is about rites of passage into manhood is just ludicrous. The final scenes of supposed redemption between Mann and his father are some of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes I have even read in fiction of any type.   The many messages of the novel are worthy, but the novel itself is quite flawed 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 The collection of stories in this anthology are pitiful not horrific.  This book opens with 90 pages of an intro that provides a chronology of "events" for the genre for the year.  An absolute waste of paper and ink.  Neither interesting nor relevant to a good horror story.  Finally the book opens with the first of "The Best New Horror", a triffling werewolf story that left me wanting.  Better stories are told by 6-year olds.  But I had faith and kept reading and was further disappointed by the quality of the stories that followed.  Don't waste your time, your money or your shelf space.  This book is not worth any of them 
 overpriced and overrated.  too many candid celeb shots - wasted pages that couldve been filled by more fashion spreads or images.  and i got really annoyed by too many images of his stark, boring homes. can anybody honestly live in places like that? so devoid of any kind of color or creativity that he brings to his clothes.  i am in love with tom ford as the next fashionista, for he is a great talent, but for someone who is going to put out a book about himself and his work - where are the pics of the countless people behind the scenes who helped propel him to his superstar status. maybe pics of him hangin out with the seamstresses, i dont know -- something that would show that Tom is indeed human...instead i thought the book, although did present some fantastic images of campaigns and such, was lacking -- straight runway shots are so boring - papparazzi shots of celebs are boring also - im sure there were arty photographers out there at his shows taking pics all those seasons.. i am glad all the image campaign ads were included 
 In "Out for a Kill," wooden Indian Seagal takes on the Tongs single-handedly. The film is a definite mixed bag, giving us both some of Seagal's best scenes from any of his films, littered with some of his worst and most unintentionally funny. The result is a moderately entertaining but very frustrating movie, frustrating because it could have very easily been better. In fact, it could have been Seagal's best film. Too bad.  Seagal plays Robert Burns, a thief who was imprisoned and who then earned a PhD in archeology while in prison. Upon release he was hired at Yale, where he became the university's most distinguished academician. On a dig in which he discovers drugs hidden in artifacts, his assistant is killed. He's imprisoned, released, and harassed by the Tong's. His wife is killed and he embarks on a killing spree after mumbling the best line in the film, "They say kill one to warn a hundred. I might have to kill a hundred to warn one."     Let us now summarize what is both bad and good with this film, starting with the bad. First, the plot is ludicrous. You can't earn a PhD from a credible university while in prison, and Yale would not hire an ex-convict, period. Second, the only emotion Seagal can convey is determination. When his assistant is murdered, he simply frowns for a second. His reaction when his wife is murdered is no more emotional. He doesn't even seem to care, emotionally. Perhaps his reaction is simply due to the sheer principle of the matter. (Compare this to the wonderful and heartbreaking scene in "Wake of Death" when Van Damme discovers that his wife has been murdered!) Third, many of the scenes are so bad that they should have simply been cut, such as Seagal bonding with the black guy in jail (AGAIN trying to make Seagal look "cool"), the VERY fake scene of Seagal flying a plane with detectives standing in front of a fake-looking sky, and the scenes of the house in Connecticut that are composed of graphics so bad that Xbox games are more convincing.  Fourth, Seagal needs to dub his own damn lines. In the first 15 minutes of the film Seagal is never shown moving his mouth and all of his dialogue is given as a voice-over, because, unsurprisingly, it's not really Seagal talking! Many of the decisions made by the filmmakers here must be questioned, such as why in the "barbershop fight," after an amazing beginning in which Seagal engages in a superb series of blocks, did they decide to ruin everything by making the guy fly and crawl on walls? DUMB!   Now for the good side: some of the scenes in this film are remarkably well-filmed. Similarly, some of the cinematography is surprisingly spectacular. So much so, in fact, that these scenes seem somewhat out of place here, as though they were stolen from a much better film. I think the director was going for a film noir feel here, and in this he succeeded. Some of the scenes are saturated with deep, moody, rich colors, creating a foreboding, brooding, almost "Blade Runner" feel. It's quite beautiful. In fact, some of this film is surprisingly artistically done, such as the male detective's death scene, the barbershop, the mah jong game room, the fight in the restaurant, the tattoo parlor, etc. In general, all of the Chinatown and eastern European scenes have very successful, moody, noirish "feels" to them. These successful scenes, counterpoised against the lame scenes mentioned above are what make watching this film so frustrating. Some moments are downright laughably bad, as when the last line of the masterpiece "Chinatown" is blatantly ripped off for no apparent reason whatsoever. Further, there is an entire subplot about tattoos on the Tongs' wrists and a "riddle" that is composed by piecing the tattoos together (though it is really not a "riddle" at all but a quote). This subplot perhaps did not make sense, and some narration was added in attempt to aid the viewer's understanding. Notice that whenever we hear Seagal's character's thoughts, it is never actually Seagal's voice!     Fans of Seagal watch him for the action scenes, which is why fans may not be disappointed here (assuming they've been able to stomach his other post-mafia films). "Out for a Kill" has more and better fight scenes than most of his other recent pictures (which have had virtually none!). There is less wirefu nonsense than in "Belly of the Beast," thankfully. Unfortunately, however, there is still a high degree of doubling. Ever notice now how much of Seagal's fights are filmed at odd angles, shot from behind his back, or are so low his head is out of the frame? That's because it's not Seagal doing the fighting. They cut to a shot of his face grimacing, then cut back to some arms playing paddycake. Unfortunate. (In the last fight, in which Seagal enters the villain's "lair," for instance, we only see "Seagal" from behind-because, it's not Seagal at all!) With that said, the scenes actually performed by Seagal are some of his best, recent work. The fight where he uses bamboo sticks to kill a tai chi sword master is excellent (but notice how the other bad guy is just kind of off doing his own thing, and then looks up in apparent surprise that his buddy is dead!) In this movie Seagal also uses more aikido than in his other, newer films, displaying some beautifully executed throws here shown in slow motion. There is also a greater degree of wrist locks, arm bars and arm breaks.   Some of the pseudo-Chinese philosophizing in the film may get on viewers' nerves, as may the mostly pointless scenes of the Tongs sitting around a table calling Seagal a "gwilo professor." These scenes are only interesting in the end, when we learn that all of these men were sent to Seagal knowing Seagal would kill them, so that their leader wouldn't have to split the dough with them. If this is a metaphor for a leader and his troops or a king and his men then it is a shallow one, as are all the other attempts at philosophy in the film made by sprinkling about random, cryptic quotes, such as when Seagal asks a Tong where his leader is and he growls, "Crows everywhere are equally black." Huh? Does that mean that Seagal will never find him? or that everyone is equally guilty? Who knows. Kill'em all, Seagal. That's what you're good at.  
 Go right to the heart of the matter with Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis if you want to know how Buffett started.  Hagstrom's book is a poorly executed fifth grader's book report on the primary investing philosophy of Buffett.  Don't waste your money here.  You'll regret it.  This doesn't even really scratch the surface of relevant information 
 After reading all the reviews this book had I was very surprise to see how terrible this book is.  Make sure not to buy this book I was very very disapointed, it is supposed to be for an intrudoctory level, but this book is way below that, the only person who should by this book is someone who has never used a computer.  This is very disapointing considerint other Sam publication. Botom Line DON BUY THIS BOO 
 I would ask parents to avoid this book altogether.  No doubt children need love, trust and affection.  What they don't need is mind control, subversive child abuse and the pathology that can accompany faith-based child rearing. Rather, seek out books that promote a healthy set of boundaries, how to go about setting them to keep your children safe and respectful individuals.  Find books that promote intellect, creativity and kindness in your children - not service to a mythical being.  It is not ok to hit your children!  I wish I could give this book zero stars 
 Sean Hannity is a joke, all of these pundits are. WE should dig a hole and push them all in, then throw in a few starving tigers. That would roc 
 In this book, Mr. Biggs does not discuss the fact that before he left Morgan Stanley he was unmasked as having fabricated comments used in his research reports (claimed to be from his plumber, Ron Valentine) [see NYT, May 21, 2000, Sec 3, p2]. Readers and potential readers of Hedgehogging should, however, remember. It explains the view smart investors have had of Mr. Biggs for some time: he is mildly entertaining, but not someone you should use for serious advice. And above all: never give him any money.  Hedgehogging won't challenge this conclusion for a number of reasons. First, it is about what the author does not say. Nowhere does Mr. Biggs actually detail his hedge fund's strategy or process. His discussion of losses from shorting oil are interesting, but only highlight his lack of thought. Is Mr. Biggs just the public face for Traxis, asking for money for no other reason than he has been around a long time?  It is also about what he does say. Several times Mr. Biggs talks about the "special magic" that it takes to be an investment superstar, most memorably when he talks of the "seeing eye" (p111).  This seems to be his core philosophy. Investment success is not made or created, it just happens to those who succeed.   And it is about his actions. In the end, hedge funds can be judged by only one thing: performance. After initial success with Fairfield Partners, Mr. Biggs does not talk about their returns other than that Fairfield "survived the bear market of the 1970s." He left in 1973. We will all see how Traxis does.  Finally, an attempt to put names to pseudonyms. Most do not precisely match Mr. Biggs' "clues," but many of the details may not be true (remember Ron Valentine). Superstar Ian (p11): J. Kevin Kenny, Jr., Emerging Sovereign Group Grinning Gilbert (p15): Steven Cohen, SAC (fantasy amalgamated with Zalmon Gilbert Simmons) Jock Robinson and Casino Resorts (p35): Robert Wilson and Resorts International Jim the Trigger (p51): Janus alums ala Warren Lammert and Blaine Rollins Peter the Great (p63): Henry Kravis, KKR Tim (p96): Nicolas Roditi The Bearded Prophet of the Apocalypse (p99): Douglas Kass, Seabreeze Julian's Guy (p104): Tiger Cub cocktail with likes of Chase Coleman, Thomas Facciola Dave (p133): David Marvin, Marvin & Palmer Greg from Mega (p192): Leon Cooperman, Omega Judson Thomas and his special Wall Street Journal (ch20):  When first written in 1971, the story was clearly fantasy. But today, it is remarkable how Barton has become Judson. "... a big, beefy middle-aged man, faintly disheveled, his shoes spotted. The face was good - strong, sturdy features arranged honestly - but the eyes had been shot away a long time ago and now there was nobody home a lot of the time... Jud knew all the big names in the game like Kingdon, Cooperman, and Druckenmiller, but they disdained him as a hack." 
 A good book to leave lying around in dentist's waiting rooms, but if you actually want to concentrate on reading about Shakespeare you'll need something much more grown-up. Anyone with such a short attention-span as this book imagines its readers to suffer from would have trouble getting to the end of a Shakespeare sonnet, never mind a whole play. This book is all bright pictures and sound-bites -- it's completely facile, a series of short-cuts to the aspects of Shakespeare which for some reason people think high school students need. They probably aren't the ones you want anyway. 
 This book did not benifit my child at all, I do not know how anyone can say that it helps. My child was so bored with it she did not pay any attention to the words, she was just set on getting it done. I talked to the local principal at my community school, and he said that he tryed using, but the children were just not able to apply themselves, and like my daughter were just set on getting it done. Half of the kids would not even do it themselves, they would copy off of each other 
 I hoped to find a great amount of content from this Catholic Priest. I have long suffered the issues of guilt in the same religion and the fear of God was about being afraid of messing up in life rather than having a healthy fear of the Lord.  Father Tom accurately describes that guilt issue. However, instead of expressing how he found the Lord to be a forgiving God and that we are in need of accepting His grace, Tom moves into a diatribe of Panentheism and peppers most of the book with this type of theology that has proven inconsistent in and of itself. If you don't know, Panentheism is a way of explaining that "Everything is in God". At the surface that sounds great. But there is more to it. It also ascribes that God is so intertwined in the creation that he cannot live apart from it. Man. That is a leap...since God is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow, and He was so BEFORE he made the earth.  OK>..so you see. Tom moves away from a real answer to the guilt issue to explain a theology that has no foundation in truth.  If you want the guilt answer...doooo noooott buy this book. Instead, buy a bible. Holman Press just came out with a great one. Read the first few verses of Romans chapter 8. Then buy a couple of great commentaries that discuss them. If you want the short answer. Hear it is. "We are not ever going to be good enough. And that is OK. God forgives all of us. Just accept that fact." Don't stop trying though. It helps others see the Good in GOD when they see it. Being good is not for going to heaven. It is to help show others that there is a good God to go to heaven to see! 
 While this book may have had significance when originally penned. I fail to see how it applies to anything I've experienced in the military thus far. My advice. Don't take it seriously 
 Okay, I bought for the price. And it is effective enough. But it is very clumsy and unergonomic, so that after a couple minutes of use it is difficult to handle any longer. The main problems are: Balance of weight, and the switch.  First, the switch: Because it is a cheap push-in button, which must be constantly depressed to keep the knife on, you lose optimum control quickly. The handle is badly placed for this, as your thumb must always be on TOP of the handle and forward toward the front of it, but you can't hold your hand up there because your wrist angle will be completely wrong for cutting. In addition, keeping that button depressed is difficult not only because it does require a constant application of pressure at a different direction from both the grasp and the application of the knife, but because the button sinks deep into the handle, so your thumb is inside the handle as you're trying to hold and control the knife: Quick cramp. Moreover, as you're pushing it in, if the food you're cutting is moist (like a turkey), juices may run onto the handle, your thumb--and into the hole into which you're pressing the button. NOT safe. A couple times I've wondered whether that shooting pain in my thumb was from nerve torture or electric shock; either way, it wasn't good.  Then the weight distribution of the knife is not very good. Look at the huge bulk of the motor--and then look at where the handle is located, and how it is designed. There's no way to hold this at a proper angle with the handle shaped as it is. Add in the need to be depressing the power button as you're holding it awkwardly, and...  2 stars for effectiveness; minus 3 for bad functional design 
 I seriously didn't like it. It is definetly not for the young and weak hearted. The characters were not likeable and the fact that everything was sexual was not exactly a positive feature. It sickened me, and i really felt bad after finishing it. Truly skip this book, it's not worthwhile, please i beg of you don't read it. I'm incredibly disappointed in Richard Peck in this one 
 King certainly lends a high-profile to this collection of latter-day noir writing and tough-guy procedurals, but I believe he created something a little too far outside the readership's expected genre for this series. The setting and characters are recognizable (now trite?) staples of his beloved Maine coast, and he works at bringing their "down east" mannerisms to life with language that rings of "Bert & I" lobstermen. I wasn't particularly caught up in the aged newspapermen's tale of their quest to identify a mysterious dead man found on the local beach. And the ending ... well, um ... the ending is definitely an open-ender. King cleverly covers himself by adding a disclaimer of sorts that the story won't appeal to many readers. Yep. You got that right, Stephen. No gunplay, no boozers, no saucy dames, no double-crosses, no slangy patter, no real satisfaction for me. I suggest Hard Crime afficionados skip this entry and look to some of the heavy-hitters from the past 
 COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER!THIS CD ALMOST SUCKS!BUT HOLD ON A MINUTE!I`M HER BIGGEST FAN,BUT THIS IS MY LEAST FAVORETE ALBUM BY HER 
 I was disappointed in this book.  The title is promising, however, the content is sophomoric - a rather juvenile style of writing.  This is basically a woman's journal entries, chronicling her personal growth through her reading experiences.  Her reading material is dated; there are many newer and finer sources for personal growth opportunties.  Her frequent comments of, "you might not be interested in this but, . . . " are tedious.  Her frequent pauses to listen to a tape and then writing, "I'm back . . . " are irritating.  I don't know how the editor let her get away with her repetitious non-information.  Wait, yes, I do.  The reason this book was published is the gimmick of a ninety-year-old woman writing her memoirs.  Given all that, if you need a reading list for personal growth and enjoy the ramblings of a woman who is constantly working on personal growth, then this book may be for you 
 I just did not like this book, it just did not have much of a point.  Even the usual witty repartee between Amelia and Emerson wasn't enough to salvage this book for me.  The whole plot seems pointless with Amelia and Emerson just meandering around Egypt's various famous archaeological sites.  As much as I hate to admit it, I really missed Ramses, and that whole England bit was far too boring.  Let's hope the next book redeems the series for me 
 I can't believe how many reviewers are giving Roddy McDowall accolades for his performance in this monstrosity. Out of all of the shortcomings this movie has, its biggest one is the miscasting of Roddy McDowall in a tough-guy role. I couldn't help but laugh every time he was on the screen, because I couldn't believe a scrawny, short guy with impeccably-pronounced British English in the role of a tough, Old West cowboy. I'm not a macho brute by any means, but when I watch a Western, I want true (actually, make that typical Hollywood formula) cowboys and action.  Other reviewers have rightly mentioned that the plot is a bit thin; it's so thin that you can see right through it. Robert Mitchum was a good actor, and he did the best job in this film even though his character was also poorly written. As for Dean Martin, I never did think he was much of a cowboy actor; he did okay in both "Rio Bravo" and "The Sons of Katie Elder," but it didn't hurt that those were star vehicles for John Wayne; without the Duke, Dino didn't fare as well in Westerns.  The only way they could have made this stinker of a movie entertaining would have been to have Roddy McDowall riding around in an ape costume with an ammo belt draped over his shoulder and a rifle in his hand (I know, I know - he was a 'good' ape). I'm not sure whether this movie or "Planet of the Apes" came out first (both were released in 1968), but that would have made a funny tie-in with "...Apes", and it wouldn't have been any more ludicrous than any of the things that are already in "Five Card DUD" 
 It's so sad when artists as talented as Connick take the cheesy, poppy (and yes, lucrative) route. I used to love this guy's piano playing and singing, but he has just gone and made such a cornball of himself that the only people that could like him are ones that consider what he does "jazz." Folks, this ain't jazz. Coltrane, Miles, Monk, Mingus---that's jazz 
 This is easily the most boring book I have ever had to read for a class.  While the case studies are fairly interesting and thought-provoking, the actual instructional portions of the book are very dry and hard to read 
 This is a poorly written book on the important subject of race in politics.  Carter spends the entire book blaming conservatives' exploitation of race for their recent resurgence.  In many examples, he is  outright wrong(such as his analysis of the Willie Horton debacle), and in  others he dramatically overstates the significance of the particular  action.  The only credible observation is that of the evolution of a new  form of politics, a political system in which "image is  everything".  However, Carter complete ignores liberal manipulation of  race in politics, and this book subsequently comes off as being very  biased.  If you're looking for a good book on race in politics, I suggest  reading The End of Racism by Dinesh D'Souza or Hating Whitey by David  Horowitz 
 This book should only be read by master level film students highly interested in every single director, film and plot summary of every movie ever made.  There are no summaries of the main points and this book should NEVER be used as a college core classroom book.  I have never been so bored and overwhelmed by such trivial and useless information in my life 
 Sorry, have saved for my trip to the Far East starting next week 
 These tighty whiteys are close to being a perfect everyday bikini. However, as another reviewer noted, there is a large seam on the right side which will dig into your hip and will actually leave a dent in your skin. I'm normally a 32 waist and the pairs that I own are for my size, medium 32-34. Streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam, but I've also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this. Maybe buying the next size up would work, but that might mean giving your boys too big of a yard to play in and I like keeping 'em close to home. 
 I love Linda Howard, but I didn't even finish reading this book because it was so boring and annoying!  The heroine was a whiny martyr--she drove me crazy!  And where was the suspense?  I truly can't believe that people liked this book!  If you want to read a good Linda Howard book, read "Mr. Perfect" or "Dying to Please" 
 This is one of our favorite movies.....but, when we sat down to enjoy it, the last 2 scene segments would not play.  Very unsettling 
 What Charles Finney popularized in the 19th century Rick Warren has taken to a new level in an era of mass communication.  At the core PDC is rooted in semipelagianism, a teaching labled heresy by the church in 529 AD.  Semipelagianism laid dormant for centuries and was given new life by Jacabus Arminius.  Today the heresy is known as arminianism.  In short the doctrine cuts at the core of biblical revelation, denying God's sovereinty in salvation.  The result is a pragmatic approach to ministry where results are measured and the question as to their biblical justification is ignored.  PDC , therefore, employes woldly business and marketing techniques to "grow" the church, reducing and often eliminating the need for God to build His church.  PDC will lead a pastor and church down a path of doctrinal error.  The visible church (unregenerate crowd) may grow, but the invisible church (the redeemed) will languish.  The focus will shift from the mandate to feed the flock to entertaining the goats. Skip this book and practice ministry as outlined in THE book--the Bible. God has not called pastors to be "successful", but to be faithful to His Word and Gospel.  Adherants of the PDC philosophy ultimately sacrifice both in their quest for "success."  
 After reading Blood Of Heaven I was quite eager to read Threshold.  Blood of Heaven was a book that I could not put down.  I cared a great deal about the characters  and the storyline was extremely captivating.  I was so eager to find out what was going to happen next.  I read the book in 3-4 days.  Well with Threhold I was majorly disappointed.  The storyline was interesting, however I really did not like where he took the premise.  The story was not as focused as Blood of Heaven, Myers seemed unsure of what he really wanted to do with this book.  Some of the characters were interesting, however many of them really did not interest me.  Most of the secondary characters  were not developed at all, they were just there.  Thier backgrounds and motivations were really not developed.  The main character of Brandon was somewhat interesting, however he seemed like a weak character to base a book around, Sarah was a far more interesting.  My biggest problem with the book was trying to visualize many of Brandon's visions, they become more outlandish and outright silly as the book went on.  Brandon's final confrontation at the end did absolutely nothing for me, I could not take it seriously at all.  Years ago when I used to read Stephen King he was able to make just about anything believable, no matter how bizarre and out there it may have been.  That most definately was not the case with Threshold.  Overall I found parts of the book enjoyable.  I did like the resolution and the development of Brandon's abilities.  This book really did not grab me.   I have just started Fire of Heaven, I do hope I am not disappointed with that one 
 Nice package (as usual with HRR) but articles are VERY outdated (late '90). I do not recommend it 
 Even though yugioh is dead, this is my favorite pack (even though i don;t get them any more). The deck that i made is an Archfiend deck, which can kill you if you don't have a spell card on the field that says you don't have to pay life points for Archfiend cards. They are also one of the strongest group if cards. There is TerrorKing Archfiend, InfernalQueen Archfiend, Archfiend Solder, and others. Even though yugioh is dead, some people still play ot, and some stores but them from you. I sold my deck for $$$, you should too.   
 After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to try Skeleton Man as my first Hillerman novel.  Unfortunately, I'm about 100 pages into it and have decided to give up on it.    I read a lot of novels and have never really had a problem with this before, but I find Hillerman's writing style to be very choppy and awkward.  I find I have to re-read sentences to catch the meaning because it just doesn't flow smoothly.     Here's an example of one paragraph that I opened to randomly:  "Getting this ceremonial procession from Tuve's village on Second Mesa to the canyon rim and them to the riverbank involved describing several more stops for prayers and offerings, the placing of painted feathers in the proper places with the proper songs, and putting prayer sticks where the proper spirits traditionally visited.  By the time Tuve had brought them to the Hopi shrine at the tribe's cliff-bottom salt deposits, Joanna Craig had looked at her watch three times that Chee had noticed.  Navajo fashion, he hadn't glanced at his own.  Tuve would finish when he finished."  It's like he talks in short cuts that you're expected to follow. When I'm reading this book, my mind is wandering all over the place because the text doesn't draw me in.  I'm glad he has a lot of fans out there, but I'm not one of them 
 This game is very confusing and hard to play.Thisn is a piece of junk. Get the origional Risk 
 What is with these British anthologizers? How perverse a talent it is to find short, comedic stories which are not funny. Sweet merciful heavens this guy found a John Cleese story that was tedious. Imagine how hard you must work to find a tedious John Cleese anything. At least in this volume you can tell that most of the authors were trying to be at least a little funny 
 This book was awful.  Josleen's "professional" point of view regarding pregnancy entails babie's as being a huge inconvenience, financial drain, and resentment to your "hard-earned relationship".  I felt terrible while reading this book.  Fortunately, newer books and philosophies exist since she published this useless trash in 1986.  I burned it because I shudder at the idea of someone else picking it up a second-hand store 
 Shhh, don't tell anyone but Miles and his "in your face" trumpet give me a headache.   I like funk and groove so I should have done a bit more homework before trying out the jazz scene. For me this CD is mostly silent except for some irritating trumpet blowing like foxtail into your eardrums.   I was about to give up on the whole jazz scene when I came upon Panthalassa. Track 1 of that CD (In a silent way/Shhh/Peaceful) is nice; smoothing out and grooving out Miles while staying true: say the purists.  If you love it remixed and electrofied (yes sir!) check out DJ Cam's tribute to "In a silent way". 
 Another book that teaches kids that being bigger  is a personal defect caused by personal weakness,  and too much eating.  If you just quit doing 'this' and stop doing  'that' you can be just like the other kids.   Complete drivel.  A waste of money. Find a book that will teach your children about the value of being different, not one that tries to scare them into starved conformity 
 Forget about what your read from people giving this a one star effort because they say its "offensive" or "anti-religious", its a one star effort because we have a great cast here that is wasted on what is clearly Kevin Smith's worst movie. As I watched the first half-hour, I was waiting for something to be funny, and it just wasn't. I was felt like I was wasting my time, so I finally hit the stop button, as I couldnt bear to watch another minute of this snooze-fest. Believe me when I tell you that I find everything amusing, hell I even bust out laughing when watching Spongebob Squarepants. If you are a fan of Kevin Smiths films, please stay away from this one. Go into your collection and watch Mallrats on Clerks again 
 This novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries.  In between the entertainment biz cliches, the author can only think to put various assination hits.  some of the characters are interesting but not believable, and they  certainly can't make up for the braindead plot.  Read some of his other novels and skip this one 
 'the executioner's song' holds the dubious title of the worst book I ever read cover to cover. seriously. it's tedious, massively overlong, mawkish, trite, trivial and badly written. in fact, it was a milestone in my reading- I never just trusted an author to pull it all together again. now I just drop a book if it's going as badly as this one did.  the only remarkable thing about Gilmore is that he insisted the death penalty be applied to him, even tho it wasn't mandatory in that state anymore. Mailer fails to come to any significant conclusion about this, despite having a whopping 1072 pages in which to do it.  basically, Gilmore is a run-of-the-mill petty criminal, with relationship troubles. he gets caught after killing two men in a botched hold-up. he gets 'life', but instead insists on being executed. he gets executed. the end. there- you don't need to waste your time reading it now- the book draws no further conclusions about his motivation, the ethics of the death penalty, the morals of crime, or indeed anything at all. poppycock 
 Many years ago - more than I'd care to remember, truth be told - I was spellbound by the first two books in this trilogy (Wideacre and The Favored Child, respectively). At the time, I searched high and low, but could not find, the concluding chapter of the series. I went on to read and fall in love with another book by the same author - The Wise Woman - but my search for Meridon proved elusive.  Until recently, that is.  With the reprinting of the trilogy, I anxiously rushed out and picked up Meridon, worried that I might have difficulty picking up the saga, as my memory is... well, not good, to say the least.   Without hesitation, I dove into Meridon... and quickly found myself mired in a story which had it's interesting moments, but spent far too long on the road with circus folks and not nearly enough time at the beloved estate around which the previous two books had centered.   Anyone wondering how this book would fare as a stand-alone read, were it to be picked up without having read Wideacre and The Favored Child, need not fear. I believe it works perfectly well on its own. I doubt, however, that anyone reading the conclusion of the saga would feel compelled to rush out and purchase the first two books. Which is sad, considering how excited I was to get to the third book based on what had come before.   None of this is to say that the book is not worth reading, especially for those looking for a sense of closure to the series. However, compared to the author's previous work in the series, this book can only be considered something of a let-down. 
 Lian Hearn lost me on this one.  This is the third and final book of the original Tales of the Otori trilogy (there's a fourth book set decades after this one ends that reportedly resolves the one dangling issue from the trilogy) and it is easily the worst.  Across the Nightingale Floor was very good with swift pacing, a mentally tough heroine and solid action; Grass for his Pillow was a decent middle volume that moved the story forward, set up the final book and did not lose too much momentum.  Brilliance of the Moon is a relative flop.  The two main characters, Takeo and Kaede, make laughably stupid decisions.  Kaede loses too much of her inner strength -- she becomes simply the damsel in distress.  And the anti-climactic, deus ex machina resolution to Takeo's quest is entirely too unsatisfying.    If you can read Book 1 and enjoy it as a stand-alone novel despite its status as the first in a trilogy/tetralogy, do so.  But you're forewarned before you get too deep into the story, the ending in this volume is pure disappointment 
 I have greatly enjoyed the Anita Blake series previous to this installment, even going back to re-read many of them several times.  However, I found "Danse Macabre" disappointing. While the imagery and characters are solid and well-developed, this individual book greatly lacks for a plotline. The characters spend so much time having sex that they don't really get out of bed until somewhere after the first 400 pages, then they go to the ballet, which is interrupted by an emergency sex scene, then they finish watching the ballet, talk to someone at a dance club, then it's back into bed for more sex for the remainder of the book. This felt like a half-developed idea for a short story, propped up with 500 pages of extraneous sex.  Still, the endless sex scenes are very well written. If you enjoy detailed, passionate, sensual, group sex, erotica narrative, you will enjoy this book very much. However, if you are hoping for the exciting mystery and adventure of the previous thirteen Anita Blake novels, you will find none of that here.  On the bright side, the excerpt of the next book, while containing one sex scene, also contains a scene in which Anita interviews a client in her office. That does seem to suggest that an actual mystery may be addressed in book 15. Here's hoping 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 If you want a review of the plot itself, complete with spoilers, feel free to read the other reviews.   My biggest beef with this movie is the fact that any suspension of disbelief is utterly killed, again and again, due to the fact that the script writers and director couldn't keep the story straight.   There is a homage to Asimov with the shipboard computer telling one of the crew that it can not let a human come to harm. That would have been fabulous if it had actually been adhered to in any other part of the film. There are a handful of these screw ups that kills any chance of the story being credible.  That said, it was a bit enjoyable. The cast did a fantastic job with what they were actually given. If the writers would have spent more time developing the characters than finding ways to get them naked, maybe I would have cared what happened to them.  The dimensional jump effect was quite novel and was the one thing in this movie that made me say, "Oooh, cool".  Good premise, good effects, good acting, but poor writing killed any chance at this being a good film 
 Thoughful male protagonists?  If you are a forty-ish man who fantasizes about being seduced by his sexually experienced 17-year-old babysitter, who likes it rough, this novel will titillate you.  Once you get over being thoughtful about that, you will be jerked through a fast-paced predictable plot until you leave the book in an airport for its next victim.  
 I decided to give this album a chance based on several glowing reviews, but after a few listens, I can honestly say that I don't get the appeal of if. There are a couple of tracks that have mildly catchy hooks, but overall, the instrumentation is repetitive and the lyrics are sophomoric. I'm not sure if the reviewers that fawned over this had not heard a solid melody in a few years, but "Popularity" is largely forgettable.   Sure, I like to support the smaller fish just as much as the next guy, but for those that are looking for a good "dance rock" album that you'll actually remember listening to the next day, I'd suggest buying one of the Killers albums or the Brothers Martin album instead of this. 
 don't buy this item...I was cheated...now i am gonna send it back. Its really waste of your money. don't go by the price...i will never buy anything from this site 
 This book was so hard to follow I sent it back, and I have read and enjoyed a lot of books that are technical in nature or historical in nature.  As I tried to go through this book I was bogged down at once in jargon fit for AD 1600.  Not the kind of thing I want to wade through for reference material or anything else.  There are a lot of other books out there which cover this material and are a lot easier to read 
 A couple of points.  I dug this book out again because I needed some inspiration on what to do with a $17 pork loin roast. Score! In the 'marinades' chapter, there are 13 pork marinade recipes. But. There are eight marinades for barbecued spareribs. And four for roast chicken. AND THAT'S IT. There are no marinades for seafood, none for vegetables, and none for just 'beef'. There is one brief paragraph on p. 704 (five lines!) about the 'large and important part' that marinades play in Chinese cooking, but no comment on whether the marinade recipes she gives might be successfully interchanged, or how they might be modified for vegetables, other meats or tofu. A little more information here would have been tremendously helpful, given how 'important' the author purports marinades to be.  The thing that really motivated me to post this little review-let, though, is the fact that the author or her editors did something pretty sloppy. She lists an ingredient with no discussion of what it is! In the recipe for 'Sugar-Soy Marinade', which is on p. 717 of the 1984 Fireside Edition, she notes at the end of the recipe: "variation: add 2 tablespoons of catsup ..."   In the Asian cuisines 'catsup' means something different everywhere one goes. So I check the index for 'catsup'. Nothing. Then I check the ingredient glossary. Nothing. I look under 'Sauces'. Nothing.   So. In 1966, when the book first came out, were cooks reaching for the bottle of Heinz? In 2005, is the 16-year-old wanting to impress his or her friends reaching for the bottle of Heinz? Is that ok in this context? The author never mentions it one way or the other. The author also invokes 'chili sauce' in some of her recipes, without emphasizing the distinction between the Chinese varieties and the American variety. Chili sauce is explained in the ingredient glossary, and is listed in the index. But if the cook doesn't ask the question, he or she really could reach for the tomato product in the pantry. This book was intended to be an introductory text for a 1966 American audience (x). It falls short of this goal for *any* audience.  I will be exploring this book further so that I might benefit from its merits (it cost me twenty bucks!). It certainly helped me out with the pork roast. However, I *cannot* recommend it to the complete beginner *as a purchase*, even in today's world where Asian cuisine is so much more familiar than it was in 1966. And if you need a recipe for a pork marinade, go ahead and check the book out of the library 
 This book proved to be disappointing. The author adores Kay Francis (perhaps too much), but he has no grasp of film history or the times in which she lived. The book is only about the actress and provides no details on what else was happening in Hollywood or the world. The illustrations are poor quality and also disappointing. It seems a rush job with little perspective or care for the final product 
 There's little more to say....great item, almost a "must have", but forty bucks for a half ounce of plastic is absolutely criminal 
 There is a reason why some things are cheap, and it's because they are...ummm...cheap. Bad frame, uneven color on the glass. Polarizing filter aside from having AIR BUBBLES on front glass, almost falls apart. Screwing and unscrewing them is a pain. If you are even a little bit serious about photography, don't waste your money on this set. Get yourself at least a set of HOYA filters 
 Just finished this book what a dissappointment. Dialog, Dialog, Dialog...no action no plot no idea what this strange little rant of a book is about. Thank goodness there is no test 
 The continually referenced web site says, "Coming Soon." This book may be ok for a full time help author but is very time consuming to find information. CSS, DHTML and HTML Help information is scattered all over the book. The index is of little help. I'm sure someone could build HTML Help if they had years to do it as did the projects the author references. The supposed on-line files might help. I feel very ripped off that the author did not follow through on the website and example files 
 Didn't like the recipes in this one--just not our taste.    
 Sweeeeeet! Duuuuude! Or so I thought.  Ordered this item in August and still waiting for it.  My beloved Amazon.com gets no props on this one.  
 I have already bought and read Palm Programming for the Absolute Beginner.  I learned a lot with that book and it was extremely helpful.  The author presented the language in a basic but informative way.  At that time, I was an absolute beginner to computer programming.  Now, I just bought Java Programming for the absolute beginner and was very disappointed.  Not only does the author make no sense in explaining the language, but he also digresses to other topics that are just pointless.  I don't recommend this book at all.  If you have a problem with something, this book is not helpful.  Hope this was helpful.. 
 This book should get 0 stars; speaking as an artist myself, the theories laid out in this book are ridiculous. The basic gist of the argument seems to be that the work completed by the old masters was just too difficult to have been done without the use of optics, etc. To me it sounds like the desperate argument of a man who did not have either the talent or the determination to attain the skill of a great master, and therefore spent years constructing an elaborate excuse.  Admittedly, I could not even finish this book; after reading for the nth time a line of shaky, circumstantial evidence like "all artists know that the ellipse of that collar is very difficult to draw, but there are no correction marks, therefore optics must have been used," I could not even stand to keep reading! On the contrary, all artists who have spent time and dilligent effort in becoming technically skilled know that although that ellipse may be difficult, after a few years of daily drawing and painting it becomes second nature, and could very well be drawn naturally with minimal correction.  That is just one example... the book is filled with flaky examples such as those - Hockney claiming "this is too good to have been done without optics" or "this was too difficult to have been done without optics" - and I found myself thinking over and over that the man simply must not have been disciplined enough in his own art, if that is indeed what he thinks. And, modern artists must remember this: nowadays, the work of the old masters seems very difficult because in modern times artists get nothing like the education or practice time had by the old artists, for many reasons. Superior art education is very hard to find, and there are many distractions in the modern world (TV, computers, having to hold a 'day job', lack of patrons, etc.) and therefore modern artists usually lack discipline and do not live and breath art in quite the same way that the old masters did. Therefore, most will never attain the skill of the old masters. But that is certainly no reason to assume that the old masters could not have done what they did without the help of technology!  Some of the other examples used as 'evidence' refer to 'odd' proportion, perspective, etc. in otherwise masterful work. I am surprised that this author (and those readers who are artists) apparently does not realize that throughout history, great artists did NOT necessarily strive for EXACT realism - even nowadays, photorealism is not necessarily considered great art by many artists, because after all we are ARTISTS not cameras! The point of realist art is to ACCENTUATE the reality, not to copy it! Therefore, many inconsistencies in proportion, perspective, etc. evident in old masters' work are not 'oddities' or 'mistakes', but purposeful exaggerations or adjustments to benefit the composition.   All that being said, I think this book may even be harmful to the budding artist, since it may cast doubt in the mind of the art student that he or she can build the skill necessary to paint in a masterful way without the help of 'trickery' or technology of some sort. Instead, an art student should be encouraged to build skill, discipline, and self-reliance - because THAT is the true secret of the great masters 
 Philip Jenkins has passed off a supposed academic book with blatant lies. Without exposing myself to legal action, I find his use of clergy sex abuse as a travesty for the survivors of pedophiles. This piece of fiction is not  a critical examinationof objecctive academia. I am a 30 year survivor of a  priest who has not spent a day in jail and was bailed out under the  discipline of a cowardly Bishop. I feel very sorry for the true priests and  Christians. My book will be coming out shortly and will cause controversy.  I seek no money but only the truth. For those intersted in my story, I can  be reched at my email. I may sound bitter, but we have thousands of these  pedophiles. Yes, the media may have blown it out of proportion but I think  they are just reporting another holocaust 
 I List Hezekiah Walker , Donnie McClurckin and Micah Stampley as gospel vocalist with the most range and you hear how much range he has at the end of lift him up, he is almost singing soprano. This album takes awhile to get used to.There is a Mix between live songs and studio songs, different from all of the rest of Walkers' albums.My favorite song is lift him up, and im pretty much satisfied with the album because it lifts me up when i listen to it.I was  blessed to see Hezekiah Walker live and he sung lift him up, ive played in my car ever since and its hard not to shout off of it.I must say I like the live recordings better because i love live instruments .The one thing i must say is that Hezekiah Walker does not dissapoint and his music is about ministry and not about all the technical stuff that musicians and song writers worry about. Hez carries an anointing nobody else carries, he is a pastor first and a singer second, his albums are not about lyrics there about ministry and lifting up jesus.so if you are someone that cares more about lyrics than anointing you might want to  try someone else whose anointing is not as powerful as Hezekiah Walker 
 Well lets face it, Sir Paul McCartney is good at what he does, I mean he was part of the group that gave birth to what everybody now does, with of course, a few exceptions. Paul is a fine musician, songwriter, composer, and sound engineer. BUT; He is a lot older now and his voice is certainly not what it once was, although it is still better than most. It appears to me he is writing and recording this album (CD) Okay I'm old too! for posterity. He is already  in the history books with the Beatles acclaim, so why not put his mark on something of his own that will stand the test of time, and even cross over into several genre's. Will it satisfy Beatle fanatics? NO! Other than the fact that he WAS a Beatle and can't help but bring some of that sound to the table. BUT; this is Paul being Paul. If you like Paul and his taste of music you will love this. If you wane for more Beatle stuff you will be a little disappointed. BTW the Beatle stuff is done enjoy the legacy that was left and move on. 
 The author's failed attempt to be cute and clever is very annoying. I guess he wanted to follow the style of Hofstadter, Paulos, Berlinski, and others. The problem is he's just not a good writer. 
 We bought it, came home and tried it: did not work!  Went back to the store, exchanged it, took the new one home, tried it, worked, BUT 2 months later it just stopped working! I would NOT recommend this fryer. 
 Although it may be too late for some unhappy buyers, the adhesive can be easily removed with Goo Gone. Goo Gone is made by Magic American Corp. in Cleveland, OH. If necessary, Goo Gone can be poured onto the label and you can peel it off. Any adhesive that doesn't come up with the label can be wiped off with Goo Gone. Since I don't own the pan, I gave it a similar rating as those previously posted 
 I use "The Notebook" and "A Walk to Remember" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.  After a slow start with "True Believer," I was more satisfied with "The Rescue."  Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,  
 This mouse works fine on my laptop...however, it goes through a pack of batteries within weeks.  I hate it.  If I still had the packaging for this mouse, I would have returned it.  No wonder it is so cheap. 
 This is an extremely weird book. At first I didn't like it. The whole novel discusses something that Burt did to Jessica. I wanted to discover what that was, so I kept reading. It's discovered that Burt and Jessica had sex, but they're only eight. Which is weird. It's not "dark" or "twisted" like it has been described to be many times. Most of the time I just skipped to the end of the paragraph because Buten goes on and on about some uninteresting, pointless perspectives that Burt has. This book should be YA. It was such an incredible waste of time 
 Hollinghurst's character development is attrocious to a point where nothing is out of character for anyone.  While he brings together four potentially strong characters (the nice guy, the young tease, the oddly aloof and the aging circumspect lover), he leaves an unseemly amount of room for expansion on both the characters, their interactions, their foibles and a multitude of themes.  He deals sparingly with class distinction, its role in gay society and differences in city versus country life (by making the country-dwelling main characters oblivious of the staid nature of the tired hamlet). Oddly, he writes powerfully of the "nice guy's" first experiment with Ecstasy, intertwining it poignantly his relationship with the "young tease," though overall the book does little to challenge or promote thought.  The Spell is little more than a mildly believable portrayal of gay life, a diversion that should be recognized as such 
 According to the authors, the main idea behind achieving "full engagement" is to maximize your physical and mental recovery.  The only thing this book provides are obvious suggestions for doing so. ("get enough sleep and exercise", Duh!)  It is basically a book of case studies on how various professionals have implemented the "program".  Don't waste your time or money; skim through it at the bookstore and do some internet research and you, too, can become "fully engaged" 
 This toaster looks good on your counter and is very sturdy.  However, the toaster's raison d'etre is to produce toast, and at least mine produces very inconsistent toast.  When I set the toaster on 3 (out of 8) and put a piece of wheat bread in, it is usually 'well done' on the side that faces the center, brown on the top part that faces the outside, and barely done on the bottom part that faces the outside.  The bun toasting feature, which works pretty well, is its only saving grace.  My Sunbeam toaster that I bought for 15 dollars was better than this one 
 The title pretty much lets you know what you're getting. It's a grade-C howler but not as blatantly funny as I was hoping. Directed by exploitation film specialist Eddie Romero from a story that originally came from Jonathan Demme (long before directing "Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia"), this low-budget 1972 action movie was obviously filmed in the Philippines but set in some anonymous third world country. Playing hooker and small-time drug dealer Lee Daniels, blaxploitation superstar Pam Grier plays the first half of the title role, while long-forgotten Margaret Markov is the other half, Karen Brent, an unlikely Patty Hearst-like political revolutionary looking to partner with her comrades to overthrow the oppressive local government. Naturally antagonistic toward each other, they are in a women's prison camp where they wear inexplicably bright yellow mini-skirts as uniforms. Run by a closeted warden and lecherous matron, the prison is just an excuse for a lengthy shower scene and some half-hearted cat-fighting as Lee and Karen are pitted against each other. Of course, they escape but shackled together a la "The Defiant Ones" and continue the cat-fighting until they attack a couple of nuns to steal their habits.  Meanwhile, various groups of unsavory men are in pursuit - the loutish drug lord looking for Lee who stole $40K from him, the rather passive revolutionaries looking for Karen, and the incompetent police (who suffer the humiliation of exposing their privates to the drug lord). Needless to say, everything eventually comes to a head but not before gratuitous nudity by a number of Filipino women, a dog wears Karen's panties and some of the worst of 1970's men's fashion (one beer-bellied revolutionary wears a leather halter top with a straight face). There is a rather sad ending, but what's truly sad is how much of the potential black comedy is missed entirely in this hilariously preposterous exercise. Sadly, Grier is disappointing in this outing because her character is not allowed much to do beyond dealing with all the "jive", while Markov is an Amazonian blonde whom I am convinced is trying desperately to be credible. Since no one displays any talent for acting, the rest of the cast is not worth noting, except balding, bug-eyed Sid Haig, who uses his standard psycho persona as the drug lord. The 2003 DVD contains only the original trailer as an extra 
 "Messenger" is a terrible book.  Ed Lee's writing here is almost good, and his characterizations here and there are decent.  But he bogs his characters down in predictable, never-really-threatening scenarios.    Not once did I feel any rise of tension or real stakes in this book.    His plotting is also frustratingly incomplete, the final climax doesn't even resolve half the pale 'mysteries' he establishes in the beginnings of the book.  Obviously what seems to have happened here is he wrote himself a whole bushel of vague threats and ominous enigmas, and then had no real idea how to neatly tie them together or even finish most of them by the end of the book.  Very few if any of Lee's primary characters have any depth of motivation or anything more than a superficial veneer of plausible human writing/dialogue/action to them.  Everything they do felt contrived, like the characters had no individual attributes except as various chesspieces being shoved about in pre-ordained and expected motions.  And like any good chess game, if you're at all an intelligent and thoughtful reader of speculative/horror fiction, you can see the moves before they're completed, which takes any fun or suspense out of experiencing this work.  His protagonists are little better than idealized, confused archetype figures borrowed from Central Book Casting, like trying to make a custom outfit out of off-the-rack pieces that don't quite fit right.  "Messenger" is incomplete and written as if by someone who pays no attention to how people really talk, live, act, or respond to danger.  It sets up very comical and hammy concepts of "hell" or punishment in the afterlife,and doesn't even hold consistently to why or how given characters meet their particular fates.  Apparently anyone and everyone can just be possessed, at random, by unknowable demons with barely-realized motivations...all for a goal that Lee never really deals with or even tries to explore 
 I was disapointed by this book. The author ideas are very intersting and deserve 5 stars. However, every chapter starts with very few pages of text then continues with a copy/past of NTSB reports. The book has about 500 pages more than 400 arn't original work but just publicly available accident reports 
 Detailed and well researched, Christopher Hitchens unveils a small pamphlet on the life and work of George Orwell, but he rarely explains the significance of Orwell's politics as they relate to the contemporary world. Hitchens is a fine journalist and he compiles some interesting information on Orwell's experiences in Spain, India, and elsewhere, but he rarely provides in-depth political/literary analysis of the man, preferring instead to subject the reader to mildly interesting anecdotes involving various luminaries in the literary/political world. Why Orwell Matters is a minor work, it may interest curious readers who've read 1984 and Animal Farm and would like to know more, but it's far from a serious study.          
 The description of the book made me believe that I would learn more about how children develop morals.  The greatest revelation of the psychiatrist author is that character is the foundation of behavior.  There are few novel thoughts stuck somewhere in the lengthy descriptions of his meetings.  I felt at times he focused too much on creating a mood or setting that is best left to fiction 
 I've been told by many people that this show was an American Monty Python.  While it is slightly better than SNL (Bob Odenkirk, the co-creator of this series, rarely got any of his sketches on the air while he toiled at SNL, so this show was the result), it still isn't particularly funny.  The only sketches I liked were the "burger" commercial in Season One, the Iguana sketch (Odenkirk plays an Iguana very well), and the Jesus Christ Superstar parody is really good (though not particularly funny...just well shot and edited, it feels almost like a tribute).  But other sketches drag on and on (particularly the infomercial parody), and many feel forced.  The repartee between Cross and Odenkirk doesn't really work well either.  I tried to get into this show, but just couldn't.  Sorry...  
 My first Philippa Gregory book was "The Queen's Fool"  which I throughly enjoyed.  I could not waited to have time to sit and read!  So as I was towards the end of "The Queen's Fool" I began to see what other books were available by this author.  I bought "The Virgin's Lover" since to seemed to follow "The Queen's Fool".  Within the first 36 pages, I was completely frustrated at the layout of the novel.  TOO MUCH BOUNCING ABOUT WITH THE TIME FRAME.  And the time frames within the book do not match those in "The Queen's Fool".  For instance, in "The Queen's Fool"  Queen Mary dies in Winter 1558 but in "The Virgin's Lover" The Queen dies in Autumn 1558.  Another example is Lord Robert.  In "The Queen's Fool" Lord Robert lives at St. James Palace (Autumn 1558) and presses Queen Mary to name an heir (Winter 1558).  However, in "The Virgin's Lover" Lord Robert is low man in court with no where to go but to his wife's StepMother's.                                                                   I think part of the problem with this type of time framing is the use Seasons.  Winter 1558....is this November December or January February?  Because further in the book the use of Winter 1558-59 is used. The back and forth at the beginning of the book set me up to confusion a few later chapters into the book.  I spent more time concentrating on keeping the time frame correct then actually enjoying the book which must be quite evident by now with me taking the time to write this review 
 Dee Brown's The American West is the poor consolidation of three distinct books. The resulting consolidation reflects differing types of organization and style.   It is a series of disjointed, non sequential often unrelated vignettes that ramble across the Western American landscape. Focusing primarily on the West that occurred after the Civil War, it addresses a period of continual evolution, of transition between Native Peoples and their non native counterparts, between law and lawlessness and from one ecological state, wilderness, to farming, ranching and settlement.  But for all its lack of organization, continuity and sometimes poor writing quality, it is a book that manages to entertain and inform. Be prepared for some serious Native American bias. It appears the Mr. Brown feels the West should have never been developed to become the amazing part of America that it has become, but rather should have been left to Stone Age peoples in perpetuity.   It is a very quick read with lots of simple sentences and even simpler logic that in a very direct way can evoke a reasonable amount of sympathy for the author's agenda. This bias can and does effectively cloud what really happened.  
 A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.  It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets  his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite 
 It may sound minor at first, but Elmo's nose is actually orange.  In this book, the publisher chose to make his nose brown!  Elmo is an icon and a critical error such as this can be confusing to kids.  Otherwise, the content is cute.  My son threw it out of the tub, however, after tapping at Elmo's nose on the cover 
 The Irish culture according to an an Englishman's perspective. Truth? Maybe some of it. Stereotypes? Yes 
 Was looking forward to this book since I found some systems using BBs.  However, was less than impressed.  Nothing new, especially for someone that the indicator is named after.  Lots of references to his websites too.  Squeeze play-expect a move after period of low volatility, yep, nothing new.  But, no good discussion on how to implement strategy to capitilize on squeeze.  You'll learn more from the following tips than this book,  1. If price touches a rising lower Bollinger Bands (long) or a falling upper Bollinger Bands (short) in the traded time frame, that is a safe entry point.  2. If price touches a lateral (flat) Bollinger Bands and is also touching (or nearly touching) a lateral Bollinger Bands in a higher time frame, that is safe entry for trade in opposite direction.  3. If price touches lateral lower Bollinger Bands (for long) and lower Bollinger Bands on higher time frame is distinctly rising, that is a safe long entry (reverse for short).  4. If price touches lower Bollinger Bands and MACD and/or stochastic on higher time frame is showing long, that is safe long entry.  
 In a story that should be familiar to anyone who has seen or read The Big Sleep, a old dying billionaire charges a pair of detectives with the task of tracking down his daughter, who disappeared under highly suspicious circumstances. The detectives, Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro, aren't the first ones who have tried to find her - that is Desiree Stone, daughter of Trevor - in fact, the man originally hired for the job vanished himself not long after claiming with great certainty that she was still alive.  Dennis Lehane crafts a spiraling plot where you wonder if anybody at all is telling anybody else the truth about anything. There is a cult-like group preaching some sort of church message somehow linked with a grief counseling center, and Desiree may have been a member of either or both of these groups... or was she? All of the events surrounding her disappearance are highly suspect, so much so that our detectives aren't even sure she exists at all. And if she does exist, just what is her agenda? Some say she was seen with a dangerous man named Sean Price, but does he exist? It's a big confusing mess for Kenzie and Gennaro, but a page-turner for the reader following along closely.  In the end, though, this book turns out to be fairly predictable, despite the twists that Lehane works in throughout. It's an effective detective mystery, but fails to capture on anything other than a visceral level. I enjoyed it a lot while I was reading it, but nothing really stood out for me after I completed it. If you are familiar with the standards of film noir, none of the twists will surprise you too much, although they do hold up to scrutinization of continuity. 
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 Like many of you, my 7 year old wanted this for Christmas.  What a waste of money.  I had the hardest time assembling it.  The middle funnel which is suppose to pump the chocolate kept popping up, squirting syrup everywhere.  What a big mess.  And the syrup that you have to use, which we use to make chocolate milk, does not taste good with pretzels and other salt items.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because my daughter still loves to play with it.    
 H. L.  Mencken is perhaps (along with many of the adherents who pay him more attention than he deserves) the responsible for the creation of the figure known today as "intellectual snob", a person who merely devotes his existence to judge the work of others and who deems himself equally important (or even superior) to the own writers.  I have always thought that this pathetic guy had a recurrent wet dream in which he imagined that he was the author of "The Devil's Dictionary". Unfortunately for him, Ambrose Bierce was one and only. Bad luck, Mr. Mencken.  His taste in literature was nothing out of the ordinary and left something to be desired, as shown by his appreciation of a repellent racist troglodyte like Jack London and other mediocre authors. He even dared to say that Bierce's experimental fictions were useless; this last judgement being quite paradoxical, if we take into account that Mencken always ludicrously tried to imitate Bierce's mordant style for his own sake.   Who cares about this Mencken? He never wrote fiction. He's just a critic... Why bother reading his out-dated and erroneous assessments and his insufferable mental diarrhoea? You'd better be spending your time in real literature and learning to draw your own conclusions about it (I know it's difficult, but you can do it if you try). Use your brain if you have one and forget "the crackpot of Baltimore". 
 The stuff in this book is explained in a complex manner. Though it is well organised it lacks clear representation. It looks like linux man-pages are explained in an organised manner. Could be used as a reference book, but not for learning 
 A bit self-serving, over simplfied, and in the genre of alarmist, "National Enquirer"-type of journalism. At least it was a very easy read....finished it cover to cover in a couple of hours. Good airplane or beach reading material 
 While purporting to 'embrace objectivity and think critically', LeGault repeatedly fails to do either.  His gratuitous bashing of other countries based on single figures from surveys smacks of both sloppy thinking and chauvinism.  As an example, to substantiate his view that the US is unfairly maligned as crime-ridden, he quotes a report that Sweden, "the United Nations' perennial merit-badge winner", has double the assaults of the United States, 667 versus 313 per 100,000. Could this statistic, if it's real, result from differential rates of reporting crime?  Quite possibly. Would it be reasonable to mention also that many reports indicate that the US has a homicide rate that's roughly 5 times that of Sweden?  Probably, if you are a critical thinker and/or concerned about crime rates.  LeGault also uses an unreferenced survey that supposedly indicates that two-thirds of Canadians say the US is a negative influence in the world to justify a rant about the "myth and balderdash dished out by the country's legions of left-leaning scholars and pundits". How objective of him to conclude, "it is not enough to scream 'Hypocrites! Ingrates!'" As a Canadian, I suspect that we do try to maintain a balanced view of the contributions of the US, both positive and negative, on the world scene. LeGault's reasoning implies that that because Canada is "dependent on trade with the US", anything that hints at criticism of American foreign policy is unacceptable.  There may well be some value to this book, however, it will require a concerted effort by the reader to separate the valid arguments from many that appear to be invalid or based entirely on such emotionally loaded thinking 
 Ha!  This is almost as good as Norman Leff's combat jujitsu book.  Here the production value is better, and obviously our heroes are athletes. I like this book a lot for the same reason I like kung fu movies.  Here is the secret to the ninja fighting success of the old days.  When you attack someone from behind or while they are asleep, or from a distance with a projectile weapon, you have a high probability of success.  Why?  Because your opponent can't really fight back very well.  Reading this book has helped me to understand why ninjas preferred to kill people or beat them up while they were unaware.  The sad fact is that people buy this book and its premise.  They think it is a worthwhile art for self-defense instead of seeing it as the great joke that it is 
 Well, this CD is okay but unfortunately the two tunes that they released on the radio are probably the best on the CD 
 This is a kids book. First few had my attention but since then its getting worse with each book. 
 Despite the word "Science" appearing about thirty-eight times and the covers depicting spaceships and moonscapes, fans should be aware that Gardner Dozois in on record as defining science fiction as "What I like..."  During his nineteen years as editor of Asimov's Science Fiction magazine, he stretched the definiton to the point of being meaningless.  So instead of adventurous tales of heroic astronauts exploring the solar system and positive stories about the promise and wonder of the near future, the reader instead gets bleak and "disquieting" (Dozois favorite word to use in the introductory blubs) literary experimentations that are mostly fantasy or horror, or I-have-no-idea-what-it-is-but-it's-not-science fiction.  Parents should also be aware that shortly before Dozois "stepped down to pursue other interests," Asimov's magazine was banned in a few high school and middle-school school districts for some semi-pornographic stories with inappropriate language.  This anthology contains stories in a similiar vein and of similiar quality.  
 I bought this for my husband at his request and asked him what he thought. He said no flow to choppy and poorly writen 
 Many students might or might not enjoy this text.  I personally did not enjoy reading this book as much as I would have had wanted to.  Go Tell It on a Mountain is a book that allows us to know how a person grew up spiritually with the Christian God.  If as a reader, you enjoy reading about coming of age in a Christian home this may be an appropriate book for you.  This book allows you to be exposed to God in a Christian manner and the people who praise him.  Having the opportunity to read this novel will be fun and exciting for you.  Therefore, your experience while reading this book will be exciting and interesting.  The main foundation of this book is spirituality, "... lay his life in the altar and rise up, praising God," is one of the many examples of God being mentioned.  In this societies' point of view God is real and he is the higher law.  What we see is on of the members of this society not sharing the same opinion.  Many people like my self might not enjoy religion for religion to be part of their educational enrichment in school.   If you as an individual become distracted, dull, or simply uninterested in literature with the religion topic addressed please do not consider this book as part of your summer reading choices.  You will end up hurting yourself because on e of the goals for summer reading is to enjoy yourself with educated reading.  I for the most part did not feel excited while reading and writing responses for this book.  In addition, if you have problems with reading elevated books Go Tell It on a Mountain may be suitable for you.  It is not a difficult book to read, because the vocabulary is not elevated.  As a reader, I prefer books with a high vocabulary.  When I was reading I was not challenged and that added to my discontent with this novel.  One thing that might help with reading if having problems with understanding the text is to write notes to the side or on post it notes.  I myself wrote notes when it came to a point that I had to create reading responses.  Writing notes helped me, because when I needed to write the reading responses I could simply refer to my notes and not be confused about how I concluded or were I obtained some observations or information.  If reading this book I recommend discussing it with a friend of someone else to make stronger connections to the text.  Go Tell It on a Mountain is an interesting book in its own way.  There`s a picture in the cover that shows an event in the book.  I is nice to have a picture to look back at when trying to imagine one of the scenes described in the book It may be even of great help to read the critics reviews on the back to have an idea of what kind of book it is and how it may be to your help or interest 
 I bought the Duro-Med 7921LCST-BG because of a back injury--I need good back support in order to sit somewhat comfortably.  This product is very disappointing.  The material with which it is filled is of such a low density that it gives practically no support at all.  If you need firm back support, I would look elsewhere (I don't know of a good source yet).    If you don't need such support, then I don't know why you'd have any interest in this product--but I suppose there could be valid reasons that I can't imagine 
 My problem is, is that I didn't read any of the books. But just ordered one & waiting on it. I do feel that the people who think Michael Schiavo was thinking of the best interest of his wife, was only for his own personal needs. He wanted to move on with his life, he should have done it in a different way. He should of turned everything over to "Terry Schindler's" family. I am a CNA, and I have taken care of people who have had feeding tubes & did not feel they were in a vegetative state. When rolling them over in bed, from side to side as you are suppose to do every 2 hours, they look at you in different ways, they make noises if you ACCIDENTLY hurt them when turning them. They are people just like us. Just because Terry was supposevly running out Michaels money, that did not belong to him in the first place, was no reason for that Son of B*^ch to make her suffer the way she did. If Terry was going to die, she would have died a long time ago.....ON HER OWN!!! She was just to strong of a woman to NOT GIVE UP!! And as far as I see it, there is no reason to rate any of the books if you had followed the NEWS. That's what I did. It didn't take Michael to long to find another woman and move on with his life, no matter if he was there with Terry everyday. Michael was just lucky enough to find another woman to put up with that, or she was just looking for the same thing Michael was looking for. And I feel that was the rest of Terrys money, so they could enjoy there life with Terrys money. I think i've said enough......everyone needs to remember, "What Goes Around, Comes Around!" Michaels day is coming & when it does......Terry will be waiting! 
 A novel like this needs a light touch.  Instead, Brown gives us a fantasy sex scene after which the lovers lie in each other's arms discussing Reagan-Bush AIDS policy & the evolutionary purpose of gay people 
 "Rules of Engagement" tells the story of an heroic fighter-driver flying Phantom jets during the Vuetnam air war.  Brad Austin, an Annapolis grad and the latest in a long line of loyal US servicemen broke with tradition when he joined the Marines instead of following his fathers into the Navy.  Over Vietnam, he chafes at the politically-initiated, and overly restrictive rules of engagement ("ROE"), watching enemy pilots pick off US fliers while shielding themselves behind the ROE.  One of the best aviators in the Marines, he flies his way and barely stays within the ROE as he targets an enemy ace responsible for the deaths of many US fliers.  Soon fed up, he plots one illegal flight which will clearly go over the line.  WHY THIS IS THE WORST BOOK ON THE VN AIR WAR: I gave this novel the benefit of the doubt, even though it quickly proved itself to be no better than an over-glorified and under-inspired rip-off of the far superior "Flight of the Intruder".  The more enjoyable characters and irony of that other book made it the best novel of its genre.  "Rules" drops the ball where "Intruder" got it right, taking a heavy-handed stand on the ROE (they deserve their bad rap, but Steve Coonts wasn't afraid to see the issue from both sides), while not going into great depth about the mechanics of his hero's machine of choice - the F-4.  Next to Jake Grafton, Brad Austin is as lively as an action figure - Weber unwilling to give him any of the flaws or introspection  that made Jake Grafton so believable; Austin's back-seater remains a captive passenger and nowhere near the equal of "Tiger" Cole.  Even the promising idea of having Austin romance the daughter of an anti-war fixture goes nowhere. (I kept waiting for the unhappy dad to tell Austin how he disapproves of his daughter's dating a guy who may get shot down, leaving the poor girl to wonder for years whether he was dead or rotting in a tiger-cage.)  Instead, Weber loads us down with details that don't do anything to substantiate the plot. Austin is a maverick of his family because he chose to fly for the Marines instead of the Navy, a plot twist that's supposed to establish him as a rebel, even though it has him flying the same planes from Navy ships like a Naval Aviator, and facing much of the same challenges.  Even the climactic flight, the one that will break the rules, is a cheat.  While books like these don't mind chiding wartime planners for choosing a strategy that has nothing to do with winning the war, "Rules" easily settles on an epic dogfight against the shadowy Communist ace, one whose result won't have the least effect down on the ground where the war was grinding its way through an entire generation of 19 year olders.  Coonts at least chose a target his characters felt was attached to the war's larger purpose (the Communist party HQ), didn't mind using a plane a whole lot less sexy than the F-4's in "Rules", and granted his characters sufficient self-doubt to question the wisdom of their actions.  Also, there's something a tad dishonest about a book that fights against the insane restrictions of ROE, yet never has its main character get anywhere near having to answer for breaking them.  If you must read a Weber novel, read the sequel: "Target of Opportunity", also an uninspired novel, but one with amore original plot 
 Please do not be fooled by the title of this book or by the fact that Kitwana is exploring an "unexplored" facet of American pop culture.  If you are seriously into hip hop this book is not for you.  If you have no preconceived notions and/or previous interest in hip hop Why White Kids... may prove to be mildly engaging, unless you choose to delve further into the culture and music.  As the Publishers Weekly review states, Kitwana races past the so-called "subject" of his book and when he does address young white involvement in HH culture his narratives are painfully dated.  X-Clan, Bambaataa, Public Enemy, Rakim, SugarHill Gang ("Rapper's Delight" as important a song as it is, it does not need to be referenced two million times in a 210pp book) are the groups and people that create the framework for his analysis.  N.W.A, 50 Cent, Dre, Kweli, etc. are swept by in passing.  The book seems like an addendum to The Hip Hop Generation, which IS groundbreaking-Are these the unused chapters?  The few pages on SoundScan are worthwhile and thoughtful.  Though Kitwana's ace has to be his use of Billy "Upski"-of Bomb the Suburbs fame-whose few quotes are predictable.  If you enjoy the music of any of these groups rest assured you will not find them in this book, and will probably walk away as frustrated as me:   M.O.P. All of Def Jux All of Rhymesayers Jean Grae MF Doom Das Efx Mos Def (Yes! I swear Mos Def, is mos def M.IA.) Immortal Technique Cam'Ron Tribe Called Quest De La Soul Blackalicious Prince Paul Gang Starr....		  However, don't get it twisted, I'm not making claims on what's "real HH," this just seems like the best way to summarize.         
 J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.   In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.  This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.  Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.  As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.  My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book 
 It's babout a cat that fiies and gets cought.This is a book about cat lover 
 I wonder how many of the people who get up in arms about this airline accident get up in arms about the United State Navy shooting down an Iranian civilian airliner, then lying about it, then decorating the murderers who gave the order to shoot and the order to lie about it? Not many, I bet. I suppose some of you call yourselves Christians, too 
 This book is terrible. If you are a certified HVAC specialist, it is for you. However, if you are new to this then it is a total waste of money. Explanation is bad, example are nowhere relate to the section discussed. And worst of all, there is no answer keys. You will not have a clue if you are correct or not. Every chapter there are as least half of the review question are calculations, yet in each chapter there will be probably one page showing how calculation is done. Example one of the simplest thing: COP = Cooling Effect / Power Input. If you look up the index, you cannot find the word "cooling effect", find out whichever chapter they discuss, or show you how to calculate the "cooling effect". You are in luck if you do not have class that uses this book. You have bad luck if you have a "good" teacher that using this book. You are doom if you have a "bad" teacher who using this book, might as well drop it. Waste of time and money. 
 I've heard this book on tape, which, poor writing aside, is more horrifying to actually hear O'Reilly read in his own voice. The gratuitous sex (which can only be appreciated if you also enjoy harrassing others with phone sex and falafels) is enough to turn anyone off, but THAT VOICE narrating the suggestive scenes is waaaay too much to endure. A sad, sad example of narcissism at it's very worst 
 This started out as a good story filled with mystery and intrigue.  A little over halfway through when I expected it to really start getting good, it died.  This story dove faster than the P-47 in the opening.  The second half of the story waned and the ending had no closure. I hope future novels by these authors will learn by these shortcomings 
 Wretched writing makes this biography almost unbearable.  In fact, as I went along, I read it more for the astonishingly amateurish, ripped-from-the-headlines writing than I did to find out anything about Warren Beatty.  Not only are most of the quotes and factoids easily found in any interview that Beatty ever gave to a magazine or television program, but the organization of the book is very poor as well.  Pointless quotes and asides are dropped into the middle of sections, while cardboard attempts at psychological insight are made about many personalities such as Jack Nicholson.  The author drools over almost any salacious story he could get on anyone in Beatty's circle (sometimes, for several pages at a time).  And, last but not least, the author doesn't even get some basic facts right - e.g., on p. 284, after dismissing Diane Keaton with a mean-spirited quote, he writes that, "By 2001, her son Dexter was five years old, and she had adopted yet another boy, Duke, six months old."  Seeing as how the author did most of his research reading readily available magazine interviews and the like, it is astonishing that he didn't know Dexter is a girl.  Any college writing assignment is held to higher standards than this 
 I love Cook's other Black Company books, but this one is atrocious.  Bleak Seasons is possibly the worst book I have ever read.  Confusing, convoluted, and a real chore to get through.  I hope the final three in the series are better.  What a stinker 
 This movie was awful.  I kept watching it because I thought eventually it was going to get better but it never did.  The plot:  two men abandon their wives and children to find themselves, but really all they are doing is chasing young women in the tropics. They carry on a "three-some" relationship with one woman.  One guy continues travelling, the other finally goes home to his family but in all his arrogance suggests to his wife she's lucky to have him home for as long as he stays. Do not waste your time - you will wish you had the two hours of your life back 
 Just be sure to read up on this closely... it's not the orchestra you hear in the movie, and you may be especially disappointed when you hear the vocal tracts - gone are great talents Enya and Annie Lennox, replaced by no-name voices.  This is not BAD music, but don't think you're a genius for capturing the music of the movies on one inexpensive 2-CD set 
 Oh no! What's happened to one of the best Western writers in romance? This is such a mediocre effort by Thomas. I have loved her books, but I could barely get through this one. It starts off very slowly, but I was willing to keep reading because I know what Thomas is capable of. The story does get interesting as we learn more about the hero and heroine. But, unfortunately, the book then becomes very inconsistent. Certain parts of the plot are page-turningly good, but then chapter after chapter in the middle were dead bores. The inconsistent quality of the drama started wearing me down. I just couldn't keep interested in what happens to these characters. The heroine, in particular, is not very likeable. She dreams of the hero and loves him from a distance and from his letters, but then is mean to him when she sees him again in person. I'm sorry to say that I would not recommend this Thomas book. "Texas Rain" is the start of a new series, and I'm hoping that the next one is better. 
 HA. This is the most disgraceful weapon I have yet to encounter. Sure the mock suppressor and the sight and the laser are good features, but the gun is weak, and the magazine holds a meager 10 BBs. I have very high standards, and this gun met none of them. It broke within 3 weeks of purchase. But, it is a pretty good backyard gun, but it is nothing compared to the pro-level airsoft pistols. Should not be used as a side arm in pro-level airsoft battles... Good for backyard fights though 
 When I first got this disc the other day, it would not play at all. I installed the latest firmware update to my XBOX360 HD drive, and it played. However, it does not play well at all. The video is constantly "dragging" or skipping. The audio is fine though.   I can't really provide a review of the content since, so far, it is unwatchable.  This is the only disc that has given me issues 
 I bought this book thinking it was going to briefly spell out what I already know--that our advertising-soaked world is toxic--and then get to the heart of the matter: what I personally could do to make my own life saner. It did not do that. It was mostly a diatribe against "the way the world is today" and how "things were better in the old days."  Well, hold the phone, because (a)Things aren't 100% hellish now and (b)The world is no worse than it ever was, it's just crummy in a different way. This is one great argument that IT IS IMPERATIVE TO KNOW YOUR HISTORY! So here goes:  Life up till the 1950s was not all one big back-to-nature love-in. Most people have been unable to build a fire without using matches since at least the Industrial Revolution. Nobody but an idiot would have drunk from a stream in the Middle Ages; the water was polluted (albeit with feces rather than mercury), and that's why they all guzzled ale instead. Life on the land basically meant you were one crop away from starvation and you worked yourself pretty much to death just to get by. And if you want to talk about long hours and fast paces, how about 7-year-olds toiling in textile factories and mines for 12 to 15 hours a day--less than a century ago?  Yes, we are inundated with advertising to a ridiculous degree. And yes, it breeds cynicism. And yes, the levels of noise and chatter have become deafening. These are Bad Things. But the book really doesn't give any positive steps for turning these things down in your own life...and I thought that was the point? I can bemoan the state of the world quite well on my own; what I want is some ideas other people have tried that worked. Like another reviewer, I'm hoping for a sequel that would deal with these things--plus not leave me so depressed I want to stick my head in the oven. Maybe it could be titled: *Okay, the Sky's Not Falling, Let's Lighten Up* 
 The way Idle in his book badly treats anyone who saw his performance but didn't care for it shows how truly stuck up he is. Everyone over 10 who watches his performances has to believe he's every bit as great as he thinks he is or he gets negative about it. The drawing of Idle as a lady is thankfully missing from the new paperback version.   To the most recent reviewer here before me I say this. George Harrison was part of the arguably biggest bunch of musicians in history (The Beatles). There was a moment in the 1960's when almost every youngster in the US, England and Australia between 13 and 18 years of age was into the Beatles. There was never a moment when the Pythons had such a fan following. Comparisons between Beatles and Pythons are ridiculous. When Idle's time comes the only people who'll blab about him in their own books would be the surviving Pythons (even Carol Cleveland) 
 Man, you can't keep selling the same book forever and keep everyone satisfied. I liked the way they presented the idea of BW, but it was seriously outdated. They should make enhancements and upgrades atleast one in two year 
 Having recently built a digital picture frame from scratch, I was excited when someone gave us this frame for xmas, to see what a commercial frame would be like. After using it for a few weeks, I have to say that if it wasn't a present I would return it and get one that was built by people who had some sense of innovation.  The Good:  * Screen is bright, images look great * Resolution is only 640x480 but it will play images up to 10 megapixel and they look pretty good to me. Doesn't seem like you need much higher resolution than that on such a small screen.  * Computer connection worked great - I plugged it into my xp box, all drivers installed automatically without the need for a cd and then 4 new removable drives showed up. It would be nice if only the drives with a card in them showed up but this is a minor issue.  The bad:  My main complaint about this picture frame is that the people who made it obviously had no interest in making the sort of product that you enjoy using because it is clear that the inventor appreciated why such a product would be fun to have or what makes it an improvement over what was there before. If I bought this frame in 1999 or if it cost $50, I could have forgiven it for the poor design, but in 2007, for $180, it is completely unacceptable.  We live in the future here people, get with the program!    I have not used other frames on the market, but given that you can buy an old tablet pc with a 12" screen on ebay for $70, strap it into a cheap frame and make your own, pc-based screen that works 100 times better than this frame, just by running a screen saver for under $150, I'd say this frame is not worth the money at all. This screen just doesn't deliver the goods for the price.  Some details: * Menu system is insanely poorly designed - for instance, you have to be in a specific menu to adjust the system settings - pushing the "setup" button at any other time does nothing despite the fact the the setting are global * Remote control only works when you are standing about a foot from the computer and pointing it directly at the tiny IR hole in the front of the screen. * Screen only works as a horizontal frame - there is no way set it up as a vertical frame (i.e. as a 480x640 frame) because the frame automatically rotates vertical images and there is no way to turn this "feature" off. * The slowest slideshow speed setting is 1 minute between images. Your only other option is to have it just be on 1 image that doesn't change. * No way to connect remotely to the computer or to easily  get images onto the frame without having to take the frame to where your computer is or go through a tedious process with a memory card an the crappy menu system. * Good viewings angles are limited but this is a general problem with lcd screens 
   I've read 8 books by Nancy Kress but after this one I'm not sure I'll read more.  This book degrades into military fiction, and leaves out the development of characters so they are nothing but shells.  This book is sorely unrealistic leaving the story unbelievable.  I can't explain too much without giving away the story, but basically, the Furs who are supposed to be a very intelligent race are not smart enough to use ceramics and know nothing about quarantines.  I thought the setup for this series was interesting but I think Kress is concentrating on a prolific career instead of worrying about plausibility.  Let's hope the next series is not about war with aliens 
 I just don't get the sixties guys sometimes. Maybe forty years ago pointing out the flaws in the American experience was novel, although coming twenty years after Henry Miller and others,  it was probably not that shocking to anyone that payed attention to the various literature. This is a smug book, with its smugness somewhat masked by Southern's cutesy tones and farcical situations that he sets up. Maybe it was groundbreaking then, but it comes off as a bit dated and ineffectual now 
 I was really looking forward to reading this book after having read many of the glowing reviews. While Jim Fusilli is an author with potential I was largely disappointed in Closing Time, his first effort. The basic premise is interesting and Fusilli's descriptive abilities of the sights and sounds of New York strongly ring true. However, the plot is too drawn out and Fusilli seems unable to forego describing all the thoughts and feelings of his main character, Terry Orr. By the time I got through the first quarter of Closing Time (about 75 pages), I was spending as much time thinking about what to read next as on the story itself. Closing Time is not a bad book, it's just not an especially good one. If you're into reading the first works of authors with promise, than Closing Time might be worth your time -- but buy in paperback, or better still, get it from the library. Otherwise, since there are so many books and so little time, I'd suggest you skip this book 
 I am having a hard time understanding why people have raved about this book.  I guess everyone is entitled to have loyal fans, but I just don't see what was great, or even good, about this story.  Two teenagers enter a school and end up killing seven people.  They are caught, they confess, and the Grandmother of one of the killers hires Spenser to prove the boy's innocense.  We are given the impression a great mystery, with possible red herrings, is about to entertain us.  Alas, it is not to be.  The kids did it, plain and simple.  Why they did it is so stupid.  The story reads as though a sixth grader has written it.  The plot is lame, and even as lame as it is, it isn't executed well at all.  The characters are boring and 2 dimensional.  The banter which takes place between the main character and others, while it seems to be trying to be witty, is just dumb and unbelievable.  I just can't say enough about how stupid this story is.  There are too many wonderful mystery authors out there writing gripping, intense works of fiction to waste your time on this one.  This is the first novel I have read by this author and will most definitely be my last 
 Kaplan is an excellent writer with several great titles to his credit.  However, "Warrior Politics" is not one of them.  While Kaplan's prose is crisp and pointed, he loses focus on his subject roughly 80 pages or so into the book, and the reader is left with a muddled mess.   Secondly, Kaplan's main thesis (the need of world leaders to embrace a 'pagan' disposition and to learn from the past) varies at times from obvious to silly.  Along with these fundamental problems, Kaplan also inserts extreme claims (i.e. Churchill single-handedly saved the West) without defense or solid explanation.  Also, the author contradicts his own points several times over within the brief text.  It seems the initial idea for this work, albeit a tad obvious, is interesting enough.  However, the following body of work fails to deliver on an intriguing premise.  For fans of Kaplan, prepare to be disappointed.  For those new to his work, don't judge the writer solely on this book 
 Sorry to disagree with the enthusiastic publishers and some readers, but I found Fox Evil an utter bore, with little action, long-winded conversation that doesn't move the story forward, and characters for whom I felt little interest. Walters also knows little about police investigative techniques, judging by the interviews that various officers conduct. Sadly, I've been unable to complete Walters last two books, also boring and with unsympathetic characters. She has been a disappointment for me, for I really enjoyed her earlier works, The Ice House, The Scupltress, and the Scold's Bridle. I also find her injection of news items, letters, police reports, etc., as shortcuts to explalining certain plot action. Either describe it succinctly as possible or let the characters do it. I'm not holding my breath for Walters nexr opus 
 This book and its author's audacious writing style are so intriguing it draws one in despite three warning signs: 1) it's billed as 'post-modernist' which too often means a poor work which is defended on the basis of its detractors being too dull and simple to understand it in all its glory 2) it's historical fiction, which too often means the author is neither creative enough to make up his own story nor skilled enough to make accuracy rewarding and 3) it was recognized by the national book award which too often lately means the public is right for once, the reason only 200 people have read this book is that it's not good.  These telltales notwithstanding the book has the power to fascinate, and readers who hate to give up, or love a challenge, or whose curiosity is powerful will likely press on to see where this careening narrative is headed and be unable to stop - for a while.  Vollmann writes long, confusing, and through varied narrators but in the end this is not Dostoyevsky, Pynchon, or Faulkner.  Vollmann DOES have ability.  It's been pointed out by (just about all) reviewers that the book desperately needed aggressive editing, but reading it makes one think this author's ego would never permit that, so there's probably little hope of him realizing his true potential as a writer.  He certainly didn't with this one. Behind the awards and condescension of its champions this is just a mediocre book that's so so sooooooo long even a sucker for clumsily sprinkled erotica such as myself simply can't stand it 
 Playboy asks why this movie hasn't become a cult classic.  I'll tell you.    First of all, the painting on the cover does not look like the actual woman in the film.  One or two of the reviewers liked the way she looks.  Okay, to each his own, but don't be surprised if you find her unattractive.    Second, the nudity.  No, she is NOT nude all the time.  Nor half the time.  Nor a fourth of the time.  Nor...  She's nude a few seconds now and then.  No more than any other movie.    Third, the movie is only 79 minutes, and the first four of them are skippable.    The movie is mostly a man fighting with a Neanderthal survivor.  Both behave more childishly than primitively.  You'll see more convincing behavior in Clan of the Cave Bear.    There are NO explicit sex scenes.  Also, no effective sex scenes of any kind.  Even the fight scenes are disappointing.    Oh, and did I mention that the dialogue is a joke?    Bottom line: for almost every viewer, this movie will not be worth watching even once.   
 Died after 6 months, could not configure.  Would only reset to default config which gave no security.  Worthless.  Support was BAD!! Never again for Netgear products! 
 I can't believe this was a Lifetime movie.It does make us wonder about Linda Hamilton's post-Terminator career choices.She's no Sarah Connor,future mother of mankind's savior,but a mousy journalist investigating Jacqueline Bisset,who may or may not be a madam.Linda Hamilton seems to be discomfitted in this movie,and with its awful script,it's no wonder why.  Jacqueline Bisset plays a Frenchwoman who combines the Professor from "My Fair Lady" with the campiness of Mame.She's being campy&clearly enjoying it.  Linda Hamilton is "transformed" from being an ugly American to an erotic Mademoiselle through buying lingerie,having a loooong dressing room sequence&watching pornos.Having a fling with a hot photographer apparently perks her up too.  This movie makes good for early morning watching (say 4 am,before going to work?),and it makes for good campy fun.If you're having a Bad Movie Night,put this on your list,have some French rose wine&chow down on chocolate croissants!  "Sex&Mrs.X" is hardly an epic,but it's a PERFECT GUILTY PLEASURE 
 As in my title I have mixed feelings about this toy. My children both have the original color version of the VideNow. I thought I would upgrade them to the newer version. They have a cheap feel to them and don't seem to work very well. In fact one is going back to the store next week for a trade in. There is a lock botton that freezes the bottons so you can't accidently turn off while watching. But it seems like the buttons freeze up on their own quite often. I can see why the batteries go dead quickly because if a child can't turn off the unit it just gets left on! I am very dissapointed in this. The kids really enjoyed their Color versions and I feel I shouldn't have gone to the extra expense to upgrade them. However, even with it's faults my kids still enjoy them. My kids don't watch a lot of TV and prefer the shorter pvds to the long Dvds. I prefer that too. That way I can say they can watch one show and know they won't be watching for an hour or more. If you are a parent thinking about purchassing one- keep you receipt in case you need to exchange and carefully think about how your kids will be using it. If your child is easily dissapointed by items that may not work properly this may not be the item for you 
 This book contains nothing but hobo meals and other worthless recipes. If you expect to ever leave the backyard, you had best buy a better book 
 Until Lord of the Flies I had NEVER left a book unfinished. Flies was excruciatingly dull, and uses way too much advanced vocabulary making it impossible to understand. The plot was horrible, and the characters under developed. I had trouble keeping the characters straight. They just seemed to blend together and had no distinct personality. I pity anyone sucked into reading this. It was one of the worth things I have ever read and I absolutely despise it. I would just like to know what the heck Golding was thinking when he wrote this! If it was possible I would have given this book a negative ten. A one is much too high for such a poor excuse for literature. 
 Do not buy this DVD as it is a total waste of money,Joe Walsh can be heard on a much better DVD with Eagles Farewell 1 Melbourne,Au. This DVD DOES NOT have DTS 5.1 Audio format as advertised 
 The opening strip scene is reminiscent of Barbarella - too bad those aren't Basinger's legs though. Nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by Kim Basinger. I have never understood Ackroyd's characters. And keeping in form, he is once again as unfunny as mud. Basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film, but that's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film. OK so she munches on batteries, and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime. She seems a genuine Betty Crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts. Jon Lovitch also tries to prop up Ackroyd and this weak script. However, his contribution seems way overstated to me. He doesn't have much to do. Funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people. Basinger's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do. Think, Jar-Jar Blinks. I suppose it's OK as a backdrop for housecleaning. But that's it. Flat and mechanical 
 you people don't actually STill think this thing is a "hero" do you?  oink, oink...he's ganna teach anyone about morals...what a joke...and all of you that still fall prey to his falasies...and fantacies.  one star because zero seems to be missing here. BIG zero 
 i had never known that there was a movie made about the life story of one of my very favourite singers patsy cline.well they needn't have bothered as it was a very much by the numbers story something definetely not above anything that you would see as a midday movie on any weekday.i liked both of the main actors,jessica lange and ed harris.the problem for me was that there was no attempt at conveying any real depth to the characters.whilst i appreciate that there has to be some element of fiction in most bio-pics anyone watchimg the movie and not having heard of patsy cline would be none the wiser for her motivations and driving forces.the only saving grace for me was that patsys singing was used in the movie to at least try to convey the quality that others saw in her singing 
 J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.   In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.  This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.  Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.  As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.  My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book 
 Trendy revisionist garbage as to be expected from the Yale imprimature. This edition is strictly for collegial faculty club bores. Get the edition edited by Stefan Collini instead he's less interested in himself 
 Whenever I read a book and find obvious errors that I know about, and I am not even an investigative journalist, I wonder what else is wrong about it.  Ms. Nasar, it's Jacob Wirth Restaurant in Boston, not Jack Wirth and the law firm was Choate, Hall & Stewart, not Steward 
 Just a collection of opinions and faux reengineering idea 
 Read Craft's book instead. It's the same series of events, better written and much more interesting.  I found myself skipping the build up to Apollo 13 
 This book is nothing special. Imagine George R.R. Martin's a song of ice and fire but make it boring and hard to follow with a really so so narrative and no emotion-you'd get this book.  This is basically just like the normal Middle Ages, but with monsters and other creatures that are never explained. Take normal human conflicts, throw in some obscure stuff, and viola-here is the Kings Dragon, a boring and extremely typical fantasy book. I can't say I'd recommend it just because there's nothing really good about it (although, there's nothing bad either) and nothing grabbed my attention in any way. I won't continue on with the series and I'm not interested in this author anymore. Maybe this book is more for people who like intrigue fantasy or more normal fantasy books, stuff with nothing really fantastic in it, but this just wasn't my kind of book.  
 "My edition of Demanding the Impossible was published in 1992 by HarperCollins Publishers. On p.561, Marshall writes that:    David Friedman sees such agencies as both brokers of mini- social contracts and producers of 'laws' which conform to the market demand for rules to regulate commerce. Each person would be free to subscribe to a protective association of his choice, since 'Protection from coercion is an economic good.' Apart from adumbrating The Machinery of Freedom (1973), Friedman has popularized Hayek's defense of capitalism as the best antidote to the serfdom of collectivism in books with such self-explanatory titles as Capitalism and Freedom (1962) and Free to Choose (1979).  The true author of Capitalism and Freedom and Free to Choose is of course Milton Friedman, David Friedman's non-anarchist father. Milton Friedman is not mentioned in the two preceding pages of the chapter; and in any case "Friedman" clearly is meant to refer to David Friedman. (Nor is Milton Friedman in the index or bibliography of the book, although at least Milton Friedman's books are omitted from the bibliography rather than attributed to David Friedman's authorship a second time.)   This error is so egregious that the reader can only conclude that Peter Marshall presumes to write about books that he has never even seen the cover of, much less read. Whether Marshall corrected it in a subsequent edition, or whether the error was simply corrected by the transcriber of the widely available Internet exerpt , I do not know. But even if the correction was Marshall's, for this kind of error to have made it into a published book speaks volumes.   On the same page, Marshall writes that:   The writings of Ayn Rand, a refugee from the Soviet Union, best represent the intellectual background to the new right-wing libertarianism in the United States. In her The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism (1964), she attempted a philosophical defence of egoism while in her novels she portrayed a superior individual fighting the forces of collectivism, particularly in the form of the State. Her superior individual, driven by a Nietzschean will to power, appears in the guise of a capitalist entrepreneur who is presented as the source of all wealth and the creator of all progress. Rand claimed that she had a direct knowledge of objective reality, and her 'Objectivist' movement had a considerable vogue in the sixties. Like most anarcho-capitalists, she is convinced of the truth of her own views, which to others appear mere dogma.  And in my edition, the paragraph immediately ends. The next paragraph begins, "Amongst anarcho-capitalist apologists, the economist Murray Rothbard is probably the most aware of the anarchist tradition."   Again, this outrageous error has been corrected in the Internet excerpt of Demanding the Impossible. But it provides additional proof that Peter Marshall presumes to write about books and authors that he has never read. Ayn Rand's attack on anarcho-capitalism (in "The Nature of Government," one essay in her The Virtue of Selfishness) is so clear that Marshall could only make this error by failing to have even read the author whose views he is describing.   These are only two of Marshall's numerous factual errors which demonstrate a shocking lack of basic standards of scholarship. After all, a book is not a Usenet posting; one is supposed to spend months or years in study, fact-checking, re-writing, and so on.   Some similar errors appear in Ulrike Heider's Anarchism: Left, Right and Green. Once again, there are errors so gross that the only possible explanation is that Heider presumes to write about books she has never read.   A few examples of her poor scholarship:    "Menger is considered the founder of the Austrian School of Economics, which continued to refine its theory of monetary value until the middle of the 20th century. The most prominent descendent of this school of thought is is monetarist Milton Friedman, the economic authority for such politicians as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and others." Anarchism: Left, Right, and Green, p.100.  Milton Friedman is not and never has had any affiliation with the Austrian School. In fact, he is the most famous member of the rival Chicago School, which even a minimal study of the differences between free-market economists would have revealed.   "If it weren't for their obsession with work and their misanthropic outlook, one might mistake Rand's heroes for left-wing bohemians. They are always Anglo-Saxon Americans." ibid, p.105  Francisco d'Anconia, one of the four major heroic characters in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged is of South American nationality.   "Roark's rival, the mediocre architect Peter Keaton..."ibid  The character's name is in fact Peter Keating. While the error is trivial, it does indicate that Heider sees no need to get the basic facts straight when she discusses a book. The Fountainhead is divided into four sections, each named for one major character; "Peter Keating" is the title of the first section. It would be very hard to miss, unless you never read the book (or wrote from memory years afterwards).   Reversing her previous confusion about the Austrian vs. the Chicago schools of economics, Heider appears to attribute monetarist policy prescriptions to Rothbard: "The monetarist road out of such misery must lead through a depression, the 'painful but necessary process by which the free market rids itself of the excesses and errors of the boom.' [quotation Rothbard's] Rothbard recommends that the government do the exact opposite of what the Keynesians suggest: it should simply abandon its policy of inflation by giving the free market reign and by reinstating the gold standard." ibid, p.131.  Again, Rothbard spent the better part of his academic career attacking monetarism and the Chicago school of economics with which monetarism is associated.  I have been informed by admirers of Murray Bookchin that Heider's work contains similar gross errors about eco-anarchism. Since this is not my field of expertise, I do not presume to point them out, but it would not surprise me.   It is one thing to violently disagree with an author, and to express one's disagreement in a book. It is another matter entirely to get basic facts wrong; so wrong, in fact, that it casts doubt on whether the author read the books he or she presumes to write about. "  
 This book needed a good editor who knew the different between an active and passive voice. The writing is much too flowery for my taste. I spend too much time thinking "huh?" and rereading passages. I didn't  finish it. Let me, instead, recommend Wolfgang Schivelbusch's A Taste of  Paradise 
 This is one of the best children's books ever written but it is a mini version of the book and was not portrayed as one.  It is over priced for the product.  I sent an email regarding my bewilderment  to Amazon and got no response 
 This book is lousy.  There is no depth to any theory portrayed and it is organized as an encyclopedia.  I suppose I should have looked more closely at the attributes of the book before purchasing, but this has been a major disappointment 
 Wack rhymes make me puke via my ear canal. That's how wack Paul Wall is. After I have eaten a full meal and listened to Paul wall, My dinner is regurgitated through my ears. I am sooooooooooo tired of these garbage rappers polluting the airwaves with garbage. This guy wouldn't know lyrical content if I slapped him with a Mos Def CD 
 I am a keen reader of music biographies, and this without a doubt or even a close contender, absolutely the worst I have ever read. The subject of the book is fascinating, it is the author that is the problem here.  David Bret is surely the most pretentious man to have ever put pen to paper. He doesn't seem to feel that a page is complete unless it has at least one "phrase francaise" in italics on it, where surely the English word would suffice. I speak French, so I can understand him, even though I find it extremely frustrating, but not everyone with an interest in Morrissey is bilingual and this is extremely alienating to the reader. It doesn't stop there though. Despite Bret's assertion that Morrissey doesn't speak a word of French, "not even a `merci' in-between songs at a concert", he gives Chapter 6 a French title- "On ne badine pas avec l'amour". Quite why this is appropriate for an English language biography on Morrissey is beyond me frankly. All I can think of is that David Bret wants the whole world to know that he can speak French. Well done David, give yourself a pat on the back.   Throughout the book he constantly creates comparisons between Morrissey and the French singers (and friends of David Bret), Edith Piaf (who I have at least heard of) and Barbara (who???) which quite frankly do not appear to be there. In my opinion, the low point of the book is when he claims that, "Few songs better sum up Morrissey's life than [.....] `There's a place in hell for me and my friends', later adapted into French by this author for Barbara" and then proceeds to quote his French translation rather than Morrissey's own words!!!! This sort of self-indulgence is absolutely inexcusable. Another exercise in self-indulgence comes at the start of Chapter 5. Each chapter starts with a quote, usually from Morrissey himself or from a music journalist, but in Chapter 5 we are treated to a quote by none other than Mr David Bret!! This is surely journalism at its absolute worst.  It's not even as is there is a decent biography lurking underneath all the pretension. A few dates, excruciatingly dull descriptions of certain concerts in minute details, and a frankly boring analysis of Morrissey's songs is pretty much all there is to this lamentable biography. The whole book tells us far more about the author than it does about Morrissey, it is littered with his own opinions, such as the pointless part where he informs us what his second favourite Morrissey song is, yet strangely without ever mentioning his favourite, he tells about his own godmother and about how the famous Barbara named a character in a play after him, yet it is very thin on actual content. He mentions an interview that Morrissey did with a magazine that was successful due to "the fact that [the journalist] published his comments verbatim [...] without attempting to draw attention to himself, as too often happens with the music press" Surely this must have been written with a trace of irony, as this book is the worst example that I have ever seen of an author being more concerned about drawing attention to himself than his subject.  Then of course there is the issue of sexuality. Looking at reviews of David Bret's other books seems to suggest that he has a certain fascination with homosexuality and bisexuality, so of course he has a field day with Morrissey, going over throwaway comments and hearsay repeatedly, without of course managing to draw any conclusions.   All in all this is a deeply unsatisfying attempt at a biography. In the first half of the book he jumps around from the 80's to the 90's and then back again, until you have no clue where you are, and then in the second half he seems to just rush through it as if desperate to finish. Maybe he was getting as bored of it as I was. His research seems to have extended only to looking under his bed through all his back issues of a certain French rock magazine and picking out quotes from Morrissey, and he has certainly never spoken to the man himself. He actually includes a quote from Morrissey talking about the first edition of this book when it came out, "It's unsettling to read supposedly factual accounts of you and your life from people who have never come within twenty feet of you"  Although after reading this book I feel I know absolutely nothing at all about Morrissey, I am absolutely certain he would LOATHE both the book and its author. David Bret is too obsessed with himself, Barbara, and the fact that he can speak French to actually engage us or tell us anything we want to know. Oh yes, and the `extensive' discography at the back doesn't even contain Vauxhall and I. Utterly pathetic 
   Kabat-Zinn, to his misfortune, is like many people who gain a bit of fame for doing one thing well: they come to believe that that they can do many things well and, worse yet, that they have the solutions to the world's problems. Almost always, that solution is dependent upon people behaving or doing what they do.    This book is not about the meditative strategies that made Kabat-Zinn justifiably famous in some circles. Rather, "Coming To Our Senses" is a confused, disjointed, rambling, disconnected and amazingly naive and ignorant treatise on how the world will be saved if only everyone could be induced to meditate.    Tell that to those pleasant folks who are beheading people because they don't share their ideas. Or to the punks on the street who take what they want with whatever violence they deem appropriate. Tell that to the smarmy politicians and others who feast on the taxpayer's money.    Kabat-Zinn should have stuck to helping people use mindfulness (his term of art for meditation) to help them overcome stress.    Kabat-Zinn displays amazing levels of naivete, ignorance and gullibility in these pages when he leaves his area of expertise. He leaves no doubt that he is a child of the 1960s. This is apparent in his endless litany of common left-wing political nostrums.    Kabat-Zinn's writing style in this work is absolutely awful. I counted 97 words in one sentence and it was not an exception. In many ways it seems that Kabat-Zinn is imitating --- poorly --- Joyce and Proust. One chapter is devoted to a description of the descent of the author's father into Alzheimer's. It is, in its own way, moving, but has nothing to do with meditation.    Kabat-Zinn seems to think that like Barbara Streisand and Sean Penn, that he has something to say not merely on the state of the world but about how humankind can save itself. This is the kind of senseless monologue that you would expect to see as a self-published work from a vanity press.    I simply cannot overstress how awful "Coming To Our Senses" is. If you want to learn about meditation, Kabat-Zinn's earlier works are far, far better. If you want New Age nonsense, then you might find this wretched work satisfying.  Jerr 
 The amount of matter which the author has repeated again and again if you minus all that repeated matter, the book would hardly be of about a 100 pages .. Don't even borrow to read it . 
 I expected this book to be more of a training manual of techniques. Instead, every page is a photo with a VERY brief explanation of how or where it was taken, often without enough detail to recreate the idea. Although the photos are beautiful and Tony Sweet is a great photographer, the book is not at all what I expected. If you're looking for a photo book of his work, it's great, but don't expect to learn much from it 
 I watch John Edward any chance I get on t.v. and gain so much comfort that the life energy does not end but transform.  The ending of this book was the most disappointing thing for me.  All of a suddent the character "crossed over" and there was everyone who had gone before him, even his childhood dog...like they had all been sitting around in some giant living room in their funeral clothes waiting... everything was just the same as in life, only somewhere else.  Maybe I was looking for a revelation and I was willing to stretch for it too...but then the ending was very clear and unsatisfactory. There seeem to be many people who loved the book and I'm glad they got something from it but I was disappointed...but only by the book...not John's work 
 I really like Elmore Leonard and have enjoyed and respected much of his work.  But when reading this book I felt that Elmore had really mailed it in this time.  The big "surprise" ending comes as no surprise, and the book fizzles rather than sizzles.  In this book, the characters are more like cartoons than people.  All in all, I was disappointed, and was glad when it was over so I could read something better.  Just so you know I'm not an Elmore basher, I just finished reading "The Hot Kid" and loved it.   
 This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  "Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed. 
 This "Tea Cattle" is absolutely adorable.  It is not practical for daily use.  The spout doesn't pour cleanly and water ends up all over the stove.  The lid doesn't remove easily and more often then not knuckles will be knocked on the handle that does not move.  
 Gosh, i would really like to review this adapter, but---  Amazon has put my order on indefinate hold, as thier supplier is unable to get any more.  But wait! What's that blurb on the product page -"Availability: Ususally ships within 24 hours" and "Want it delivered Tomorrow? Order it in the next 5 hours and 36 minutes, and choose One-Day Shipping at checkout. See details."  So they can't deliver it, yet they still list it as available for delivery tomorrow? Don't order from Amazon 
 This reissue could have been so much more. Firstly, the versions of several of these songs are markedly different from the original album, especially "I've Tried Everything." If they wanted to remix these songs, they should have just used them as bonus tracks! And the original album artwork is not here (the back shot of David Stewart is missing), as are the lyrics. And finally...these bonus tracks suck!!! They should have definately included the dance mix of 17 Again, which, here in the U.S., was the only hit version of that song!!! What a drag. 
 Written by the same author as Cults, New Religions Movements, and Your Family, as well as Defending the Faith: A Beginner's Guide to Cults and New Religions, gives a sense where the author is headed with this prodigious "history" of the Church.  Although not an actual history of Mormonism, but more of a superficially selective journalistic survey of the Church, (its people, dealings and influences) the book offers the reader an enormous panoramic overview at the entire 170 year span of its existence.  Yes, the volume is anti-Mormon, it is negative and has no balanced view or viewpoint.  Abanes uses enflamed and sensualistic language from the start and propagates the same misjudgments as previous anti-Mormon writers (confusing the action of members with the doctrines of the institution, using enflamed and unreliable anti-Mormon sources as well as regurgitating old anti-Mormon arguments that have been dealt-with in scholarly journals and balanced histories) yes, he mostly uses only secondary materials and relies on the Tanner's as an authoritative source, and yes, the author has no clue what historical perspective is, but, one must give the author his due for the broad scope of the work.  He not only covers all the standard anti-Mormon fare (the Danites, blood atonement, polygamy, money digging, etc.); but current subjects as well (including the Osmond's, Steve Benson, the 2002 Olympics, Paul Dunn, Thomas Ferguson, and racism). I enjoyed the author's journalistic and creative approach to chapter and sub-chapter headings as well (i.e., "Bloody Brigham," "Big Trouble in Little Missouri," "Pride and Prejudice" and "Thinking is a Sin").  I like that Abanes uses the internet and listed URL's for reference and resource, I liked his use of charts (First Vision, Book of Mormon, failed prophecies), and even though this book would not be published by an academic press or a large well-known publisher, it was published by a distinguished independent publisher that was since bought by the Avalon Publishing Group.  Although the work cannot be recommend as a studious publication or an important work on Mormonism, the author does show that the Church as an institution does have a long way to go in answering questions about its past, its "official" vs. its "actual" history, and currently about its political activities, treatment of its "academic" members (versus the coddling it shows towards its more notable members (including general authorities) as well as its suppression of its own history that includes the closing-off of its records and library.  The volume has 436 pages of text, five appendices (one containing a helpful glossary of "Mormon terms"), 152 pages of notes, a small bibliography and a 22 page index 
 I wish I had put storage bags on my registry instead.  They work okay as a multipurpose container, but my freezer is full of these things. Moreover, I got the 8 oz ones, so they are only 1/2 full as my newborn only drinks 3-4 oz right now.    One of the major pains about these is that you have to buy the lids and the containers seperately.  Plus, you need an adapter to fit the pump..something I didnt know I needed and didn't get.  Another waste of money from Avent. 
 I read tons and tons of reviews of this product and decided to take a chance on it.  Well that chance did not pay off.  Even in combination with the plug-in model my cat continued to spray everywhere.  If anyone else has ideas for something that does work i would really appreciate it 
 ...just like Hollywood and just like the music industry which, I guess, is the point.    John Travolta, playing on his character from Get Shorty (and, to a lesser degree, like his character in Pulp Fiction and Swordfish) is Mr. Cool.  This time he's trying to make it big in the music biz.  He discovers a new talent (artist Christina Milian) and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters.    A brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar.  The dialogue seems forced, funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile.  Most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae.  Aside from a few interesting moments, only one speech toward the end made by Cedric the Entertainer redeemed the film.    It's like a big commercial (which, I suppose, is any Hollywood film).  Certain musicians get shameless plugs (Steven Tyler and Aerosmith, included in the film), various movies get shameless plugs (including, in a not so disguised fashion, Get Shorty), certain Hollywood landmarks (e.g. the Mann Chinese Theater) are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the L.A. Lakers and the Staples Center get a plug.    It's an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or, in this case, making a musician.  So we watch Travolta as Mr. Cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give Christina Milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts.  The ending is so horribly cheesy I felt as if I was watching American Idol.  Watchable, but barely.  The Player covered this terrain so much better.  
 I had heard a lot about My Chemical Romance, both positive and negative. I decided to pick up a used copy of 'Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge' so I could form my own opinion without the biased input of from jaded indie hipster snobs or 14 year-old spoiled scene kids.  This record was written and marketed to deliver pop songs, and the opener 'Helena' is an outstanding one. It has a great melody that stands up to repeated listening, and the performance is passionate and convincing. The problem is that on every other song on the album, I was bored with the melodies and performances, even after extensive repeated listening [I'm talking about keeping this in my CD player for over 2 months, not just a quick skip-through]. The high-gloss production values suffocate any negligable amount of rocking power and sonic depth that the music might have had, and the juvenile melodrama of the lyrics and melodies gets old real fast when they don't deliver the pop hooks they promise.  This album does not rock. Period 
 The idea behind the book is great, but the book itself fails to meet  expectations. The description on Native American life seemed  superficial  and like it had no experience or research behind it.  The charachters were  good, but the whole book seemed like a rough draft.The story never went  into enough detail. It jumped from one event to another without ever  spending enough time on each event to interest me.My advice is to skip it 
 The glossy photos in this pricey book can help spark your imagination to come up with interesting-looking starters.  I found several of the actual recipes, however, bland and uninteresting.  Also beware that many of the photos are printed backwards or upside down so captions don't match. While sometimes pretty and pleasant, the look of the food is frequently rococo and overdone--the book doesn't follow its own advice to keep the presentation simple and the decorations in harmony with the setting. .. 
 In this book, Gavora continues to perpetuate the myth that Title IX is responsible for the elimination of men's sports.  Nevermind the fact that nowhere in Title IX does it say cut men's teams and create women's teams.  However, that is what Gavora insinuates which is just wrong.  It is administrators (mostly men) who make the decision to eliminate sports, a small fact which Gavora overlooks.  Overall, this book was filled with inacuracies and I would not recommend it 
 This item really sucked. It never really worked. I would of sent it back, but being a low price, it wasn't worth my time. I tried it on 2 differant computers and 2 printers. Same result 
 I've been searching for a good book on Christian discipline, and I thought this might be it.  But after evaluating Clarkson's claims of what the Bible says about discipline, I had to return this book.  He has some great ideas, and I certainly lean toward using grace in raising young children.  But after a careful review of his word study on Proverbs, I can't come to the same conclusion that he does.  I even asked for my pastor's help, and he also does not feel that Clarkson is right in that regard.  I think he is correct at the end (...) when he says that it is a choice that parents need to make  but it is not mandated by the Bible.  And I know that there is probably useful information in this book, but too much of his discussion hinges on his Biblical conclusions that I find false 
 I know that everyone else seems to love this, so perhaps my complaint is more about Apple in general. My Ipod Mini (pink)is a lemon. The battery has never worked properly. It takes longer to charge than to discharge, and my current playing time per charge (no changing settings, not backlighting, nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies) is about 2 hours. Apple will gladly sell me a new ($70) battery, but other than that tough. It is apparently my fault thet they're selling shoddy products. I'm not saying don't buy it. There aren't realistically any better choices out there than the Ipod, but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you. As for me, I think I'm going to dig out my old discman 
 I had to stop reading this book after about 60 pages, due to the exauhsting format of reading about everyone other than Patton. This book would be good for those with a lot of patience, and those that are interested in Patton's parent's, grand parents (as well as learning about their life, careers, likes/dislikes, ect)and the pain staking, very lengthy details of the background of every senario in Patton's life. I would simply like a very intriguing book, that gets to the damn point, but can keep my attention. 
 As a college student, I am required certain books for my history class.  The firsthand account books I have read this semester have been very enjoyable (Kaffir Boy & Son of the Revolution).  However, even though Soldiers of God is a firsthand account of Robert Kaplan traveling in Afghanistan & Pakistan during the Soviet invasion & occupation, it was one of the most boring books I have ever read.  I could barely read 3 pages without beginning to doze off.  The action is limited and sporadic and the commentary is less than stellar.  If you are looking for another Kaffir Boy this book is not the one to pick. 
 I had not read Danielle Steel in several years.  I found The Cottage to be shallow, implausible, and completely predictable.  I was very disappointed with this work 
 this is the worst book i have ever read,,it is very dull and unuseful..i9 bought it because i have read about the popularity of the surgeon who wrote it. i wish i can return it and get a refund..but i have threogh it in the tras 
 Rothbard, now dead, was a noted libertarian activist and pseudo-economist who feared socialism (especially in Europe) in the 1960s and 1970s. First, I want to be clear that I am not objecting to Rothbard's views, but rather reviewing the accuracy of his explanation of the Great Depression, which in my opinion is inaccurate and a front for his activism. Treat it as a detailed work of a leading activist and not as an accurate description of the Great Depression.   In contrast, modern quantitative economic studies have considerably advanced our understanding of the Great Depression. For the economics of the Great Depression, I highly and sincerely recommend the recent and rigorous "Essays on the Great Depression" by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke or the old (and slightly outdated) "Monetary History of the United States" by Milton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz" (which helped Friedman win the Nobel Prize in Economics). There are also other excellent books, such as the rigorous 1996 "Golden Fetters" by Barry Eichengreen and Harold James. Yet Bernanke should be your first choice, followed by Friedman.  Another groundbreaking book on the economics of the Great Depression was the 1973 "A World in Depression" by Charles Kindleberger (also now dead) that focuses on the international aspects (including the gold standard) and presents a sharply different interpretation than Rothbard, but that book also is a little outdated. Read Bernanke's book.  Rothbard's dinosaur book still attracts some interest for its PHILOSOPHY. The Austrian School, founded in 1871, favors a laissez faire economy, views economics in only non-measurable, general terms, and rejects quantitative methods in economics. It is not economics as we understand economics today.   For a historical review of the New Deal from a somewhat critical perspective and a readable summary of the economics of the Great Depression, including the role of the constrictive gold standard, read David Kennedy's Pulitzer-Prize winning "Freedom From Fear." Kennedy meticulously details the government interventions into the economy in the 1930s and Kennedy makes some positive and critical conclusions that would fit with some of Rothbard's conclusions. Yet Rothbard is truly radical in his opposition to even the most pragmatic actions by the government to lessen economic volatility, and that activist agenda comes out in this dinosaur book "America's Greatest Depression."  Rothbard argues that the Fed Reserve first created inflation with a loose money policy and started the Depression, which was made worse by Hoover's actions to interfere with the natural correcting mechanisms of the economy. Rothbard is correct about the flawed actions by the Federal Reserve, but he does not properly explain the role of the disastrous gold standard in turning the contraction into the truly catastrophic Great Depression. (No surprise since Rothbard was a staunch believer in the gold standard.)   The effects of the massive collapse of the American financial system while Hoover was president are also not detailed. Over 10,000 banks failed, which was a catastrophe. At that time in history, the banks were the the financial system of the United States, mostly. That banking collapse further restricted the money supply when failed banks could not make any loans and solvent banks refused to make loans for fear of losing money.   Instead, Rothbard targets his political agenda at the scapegoat Hoover, claiming that Hoover's interventionist policies ruined the supposed self-correcting mechanisms of the economy. This is ridiculous! The American economy would never have recovered from the massive banking collapse without intervention. Without intervention into the financial system, America would have been a third-world, poverty-stricken blight. Rothbard is wrong!   Also, the Depression would not have ended - and did not end - until the disastrous gold standard was eliminated by FDR. Here Rothbard is using the Great Depression as an excuse to espouse his political views, which are simply not accurate from an economic perspective. The gold standard, the banking collapse, and the money contraction were the main causes. Hoover's mistakes were that he stubbornly supported the disastrous gold standard and agreed to sharply increased tarriffs, which made the situation worse.   History has proven Rothbard to be correct with some conclusions (read Kennedy's book) but mostly wrong. The economy has been much stronger and much more prosperous with *sensible* government interventions. (I would argue that government should be as minimal as possible but not as radically minimal as Rothbard suggets.) Thanks to pragmatic New Deal policies to encourage stability, we never again have had a depression.  Prior to FDR, there were many severe depressions and banking panics. Since FDR, we have never had a depression or panic again. Depressions were forever banished, and the post-war boom followed. American has been a more prosperous and less volatile nation since.   Go look at a map of America's GDP since colonial times until today. You will see numerous severe depressions and panics from the early colonial times through the Great Depression. Since FDR, we have never had a depression or panic again. Banks are now required to have a certain capital reserve, preventing bank collapses. The FDIC insures bank deposits, preventing bank runs. The SEC now requires transparency and financial statements following GAAP accounting procedures. The Federal Reserve Board controls the money supply. All these New Deal reforms stabilize the economy and have prevented another depression from happening again.  Once taking office, Franklin Roosevelt immediately removed America from the gold standard, and the economic contraction ended. GDP grew every year of his first term (54% over four years). Industrial output expanded 5% PER QUARTER from 1933-37 and in 1937 briefly passing the previous peak in 1929. Check the statistics.  I highly recommend "Essays on the Great Depression" by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke or "Monetary History of the United States" by Friedman and Schwartz. Also read the huge and detailed biography "Franklin D. Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom" which the highly-regarded Economist magazine called "a masterpiece."  Also read John Steele Gordan's masterpiece history of capitalism - and very pro-capitalist - titled "An Empire of Wealth." His description of the Great Depression and the post-war boom is simply sublime.  With no disrespect for Rothbard the political activist or his views in general, this outdated dinosaur book on the Great Depession is simply wrong 
 Living Things is very disappointing. The previous CD, Kimi Ga Suki Raifu, was such a powerful collection of songs, written and recorded with such clarity and immediacy, a rock classic that is truly one of his best efforts alongside Girlfriend. Living Things is touted as Sweet's return to a fully produced, thought-out album. It even has Van Dyke Parks...so it must be a slice of Wilson-esque classic pop, like In Reverse...right? There's only one problem: the songs. Living Things rings very hollow musically, and lyrically it is hopelessly bleak, the actual opposite feeling of the album's title. This is not a sunny pop album, it is a dark series of resignations on the hopelessness of life, with almost none of Sweet's humor to balance out the darkness. It just feels like a bad head trip. I have listened intently to this disc, in various settings and states of mind, and have come up short every time. The material is lacking a heart, a center of gravity. Yes, it has all the external elements of Sweet's pop sheen: the overlaid vocals, the guitar textures, the power pop grooves. On the surface, it all sounds attractive, but underneath all the layers is empty, bleak music. It feels like "Matthew Sweet by the numbers."   Moreover, Living Things is supposed to be a more "produced" album than Kimi Ga Suki, and yet it feels sloppy and unrehearsed. Only a couple of the songs have a proper "ending" or even a fade-out. Most of the tracks sound like demos, with haphazard sloppy endings where the music abruptly cuts off as if the band were only rehearsing the song and decided to quit before the end. This is not a well produced album, to be honest it sounds unprofessional. And the fact that there is no booklet, no lyrics, also shows that Matthew wanted to put this CD out "on the cheap," which shows some disregard for his fans, in my opinion. Girlfriend, Altered Beast, 100% Fun, In Reverse, all of these discs have always had some form of lyric booklet. Even with Kimi Ga Suki Raifu, there was a booklet with liner notes by Matthew, a sense of personal involvement. But on Living Things, nothing. Just the tracklist and personnel. I detect a disinterest on Sweet's part, a lack of concern for our reaction to the sloppy song endings, the redundant material, or the lack of any liner notes or lyrics. Matthew seems essentially absent from the whole operation, from the packaging to the songs.    One reviewer compared this album to Altered Beast, which also had a more densely layered production style, a more "experimental" album than, say, Girlfriend. But at least Altered Beast still had a very high calibre of songs: Dinosaur Act, Ugly Truth, Time Capsule, Life Without You, Reaching Out, Falling. There is nothing on Living Things that stands out as a memorable song in the end. It all sounds like a series of hooks and textures that don't go anywhere. Another example of a more "produced" Sweet album is 1999's In Reverse, which has the Spector/Wilson "Wall of Sound" production on some tracks, but again, it works well because Sweet wrote a solid collection of SONGS for that album. Hide, Split Personality, I Should Never Have Let You Know, Write Your Own Song. These are all true gems in Sweet's catalog. And once again, Living Things fails to produce even ONE song that rises above the surface exterior in order to make a lasting impression. Really, I cannot think of even one song that stands on its own merits. "You're Not Sorry" and "I Saw Red" are probably the "best" tracks, but even those songs only sound like hollow imitations of much stronger material by Sweet on previous albums. He's covered all of this ground before, with much better results. For an album called "Living Things," it all sounds lifeless, a collection of dead shells. Attractive containers with nothing inside. 
 I found this book to be very theoretical and not practical at all.  Save your money 
 This second release of The Batman contains another three episodes: The Man Who Would Be Bat (Man-Bat), The Big Chill (Mr. Freeze), and The Cat and the Bat (Catwoman).   I'll be one of the first to say that The Batman as a series won me over in its second season. Canada has already gotten all the episodes, and certain ones like the appearances of Grundy, Hugo Strange, and Riddler really up the fun factor to a stylish and exciting level. However, this dvd still contains episodes from the first season, which means we're getting rather poor stories with bad dialogue offset by strong animation and interesting character designs. It's a shame really, as the new Man-Bat design is far scarier than the old BTAS one, and giving Mr. Freeze mutated ice powers (ala Marvel's Iceman) is a decent twist. But these villains lack characterizations and motivations - having Kirk Langstrom transform into Man-Bat simply to be a "better bat" than Batman doesn't do it for me. The Catwoman episode is fairly decent, though it still lacks a certain spark to make it memorable.   Also, WHV isn't making anyone happy with its cheap 3 episodes/disc release pattern, with few substantial bonus features. Why every release can't be as good as the Teen Titans discs is a mystery to me.  There's really no reason to get this disc. Wait for more episodes or when WB finally puts the Clayface finale on dvd. 
 there is a certain new-fangled school of screenwriting that thinks that if you put a bunch of characters on screen and have them make no sense of one another but sound as if theyre being profound, then they ARE. the prime example of this in recent years is the abominable "crash", but at least that was (somewhat) assuaged by strong performances. this -- arguably the worst "mainstream" motion picture of 2005 -- is redeemed by nothing. an excruciatingly long 2 hours, and as much as i (usually) enjoy george clooney, i might never forgive him for this drek 
 This documentary reveals the shocking fact that companies, by law, have an obligation to their stockholders, rather than to society at large.  But this isn't the only case where 'people' by law are required to focus on only certain responsibilities.  What about doctors?  When a doctor treats you, by law that doctor is supposed to think only about what is best for you.  Shouldn't she really also be thinking about whether others would be better off if you were out of the way?  Shouldn't she give you an injection that would peacefully put you to sleep if she feels that society as a whole would be better off without you?    And what about accountants and lawyers?  Every time an accountant handles someone's money, he should be legally obligated to consider whether it would benefit society to take half of the person's life savings and give it to charity.  It's wildly inappropriate for your accountant to be legally obligated to handle your money in your interests.  What about the greater good?  And your lawyer should never act mainly for you - each and every lawyer should be expected to consider everyone equally, rather than giving special emphasis to her own client.  Let's get serious - in order for a corporation to act in the interests of its stockholders, who are the last in line in case of bankruptcy, it must first meet all obligations to others, or else there will be nothing left for those stockholders waiting at the end of the line.  As an ongoing business, companies have reason to care about their reputations, about earning loyalty from their employees, etc.  Yes, some companies have done bad things, just as some people have done bad things.  Can every single person be condemned as a psychopath, simply because there are some examples of humans that were considered psychopaths?    Corporations, like people, can do harmful, dangerous things.  There's no doubt that many of the problems documented here actually occurred.  But it is the reponsibility of government to regulate corporations, just as it regulates people.    The example of Bolivia, where people were forbidden from collecting rainwater, is an example of the failure of government.  Why would the government give such rights to anyone, even itself?  But when government regulation has been adequate, privatization of water and many other services has been hugely beneficial to the poor in most countries.  Demonizing corporations for faithfully managing the money invested in them is ridiculous.  Corporations, and individuals, should be regulated by governments.  If outrages are not detected and punished, then government has failed.  But we shouldn't abolish government, or corporations, or people, simply because none are perfect.  We should 1) hold governments accountable for performing their role; 2) hold corporations accountable for legal violations (through fines, and through sending corporate executives to jail in extreme cases, as has happened many, many times); and 3) use public pressure and our own personal buying decisions to give corporations an incentive to make socially responsible decisions.  If you really care about the poor around the world, then put the blame and the pressure where it belongs - on bad government 
 I don't know about anyone else, but this book was the one that made me completely lose interest in this whole series.  This is the most boring one of them all in my opinion, and, well, how many times can the same story be told?  Bad guy wears horribly obvious costume to try to get children, children figure it out, but all the grown ups in the world are too horribly idiotic to see anything, even when it's pointed out to them.  6,000 times.   
 Cesar Milan, the so-called 'dog whisperer', bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic - from the dinosaur age. He teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status, and that you need to use painful 'corrections' to convince them that you are Alpha. This idea hasn't the slightest shred of evidence going for it.   Yes, dogs do have dominance roles, but that hasn't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors. Dogs do 'bad' doggy behaviors because they work. Dog guards his food bowl? Dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away. Dog pulls on the leash? Dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up. The dog doesn't care whether or not you're alpha; he only cares that what he's doing works to get him what he wants.   Technically, Cesar's methods work. But they use force, fear, and pain to teach the dog, when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and non-forceful techniques. I have three hyper, active, highly driven Border Collies, and they're all very obedient and mannerly. They don't haul me around the leash, nor do they leap at guests, nor do they ignore me when I tell them something. And I don't need to be 'Alpha' to get them that way; neither does anyone else.   I strongly suggest that you don't buy this item. Good books to start with are Karen Pryor's 'Getting Started: Clicker Training for Dogs', Melissa Alexander's 'Click for Joy!' (also with a great problem solving section), and Jean Donaldson's 'The Culture Clash'. You can easily have a happy, obedient, well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain 
 To be fair to the editor, women are doing many things in their 30s, so it's probably difficult to turn this topic into a cohesive book. Having said that, this book was disappointing. Some of the women have interesting stories to tell, no doubt about it (example: one of the authors is the granddaughter of the Rosenbergs, executed for treason) but with most of essays, it isn't clear what the heck the stories have to do with being in your 30s ... similar essays could have been written in 20s or 40s, or even other decades. I got the feeling these were interesting authors who were struggling to adapt pre-existing work or themes into the "30s" theme. There were a few standouts in this book, but overall I thought the writing was uneven. If you are interested in books regarding being single in your 30s, and children and whether to have them, etc., I strongly recommend "Maybe Baby", an anthology of essays by writers which is much better written 
 The product is virtually worthless.....After making all possible adjustments the devise is totally unreliable.  I would really like to get my money back because the thing is already in the garbage 
 I first encountered the words of Wayne Dyer 5 or so years ago on PBS. I liked what I heard. Though nothing he says is original, I did like the way he presented it.  The first book of his I read was "There's A Spiritual Solution to Every Problem", the book on which the first lecture I watch on PBS was based.  I was inspired by, and enjoyed that book. As I did the next two or three. But recently, and especially with this latest volume, he simply repackages his older books in a different form. Ironic for a book about inspiration.  I want to be clear that I have no intrinsic problem with some of the concepts he talks about. But this book, and his lectures, and overall attitude lately, as opposed to my first exposure to him, are becoming quite the turn off.  In this volume, there were somevery glaring examples of either contradiction, strict unfairness, and at times, ego...despite Dyer's commitment against the ego.  I also found it very repetative, but I realize he warns of that early on. However just because something is acknowledged, does not mean it should be accepted.  The following items bothered me the most, and I would be interested to learn if others readers agree with these bothersome items.  -The oft mentioned assumption that he is personally the reincarnated spirit of St. Francis of Asissi.  -He is not very supportive of his friends. To him it seems that to even be in the presence of an unhappy person insults him. His reason being that since life is perfect and nothing wrong EVER happens to us, being unhappy or scared of something is simply a low energy, and one thathe is unwilling to stand inthe presence of. He even mentions a story of a good friend of his who started to be worried about the leaness of his business. He had legitimate concerns about going under. Not thoughts of evil or suicide or anything, just some natural worry when the finances did not look good.  Dyer, in the book, tells us "just about the time I was no longer willing to be exposed to this sort of thing..." Meaning that in his perfect life, there are no accidents, and so, he did not want to be around his supposed friend, because being a little scared or worried is ungodlike. He ignores the fact that in order to help people, especially friends, you have to be in the midst of bad things sometimes. He often quotes Mother Teresa. Yet if shehad told all of those sick people to simply "think about what you were doing when you first became sick, and stop doing it!" she would not bethe saintwe recognize her as today.  -Secondly, multiple times in just about every chapter, he plugged one or more of his other books, books by colleagues, or books published by Hay House. It is allright to acknowledge your previous works, or those of others, but the frequency with which he does so in thisvolume is disingenuous at best. Product placement, at worst.  -I call one's attention to page 106 of the book. Dyer's "12 Step Program to Simplicity." Items 10 and 11.  Item 10 calls for us to "Eschew Debt" and to live within our means...not purchases or buying things we do not absolutley need, in order to live the life we agreed with God to havebefore we were born.  The very next item, number 11, instructs us to "forget about cash value." He proceeds, on the very same page, to tell us that we should not look at the dollar signs when we are "inspired" to do something like take a trip, eat a nice dinner out on the town, or be comfortable. How can one eschew debt, and yet ignore the dollar value of an item they are inspired to posess?  -Pages 110-113. The Ram Dass Story. This is among the more insulting parts of the book. He tells the story of one ofhis mentors, and reproduces a letter he has posted on his (Dyer) own website. In it, Dyer tells of how gentle and wonderful Dass hasbeen, and how important this "dear friend" has been throughouthis life, especially since coming to live in Maui in the twilight of his life.  Then, Dyer has the audacity to solicit you and I for money to help buy Dass his own house! In Maui!  This book "eschewing" the ideaof possesions, money, and doubting that the universe will take care of everything you ever could want, is asking us to pay for his mentor's housing conditions, simply because Dyer thinks he is "a wonderful man".  How about this...Dyer isso fond of "giving something of yourself everyday..." how about cutting into your millions of dollars and cutting a check for your hero to own his own house? You can afford it, I cannot. Or if you cannot swallow that, cut him a check large enough to coverhis moving expenses out of Maui (one of the most expensive places on earth to live), and to a location far more affordable. If what is said about Dass is true, he should be happy anywhere he can find to live. They arrogance of a millionaire asking for donations to save his "mentor" who lives just down the street from him was nearly enough to get me to stop reading the book right there.  Furthermore, the entire business bore little relevence to the rest of the chapter, which was ostensibly about "Faith Banishes all doubt".  Unless you can sucker the general public into buying your guru a home in Maui.  -The name dropping throughout the book. He studied with, worked with, talked to, helped the luggage problems of...fill in the blank with celebrity X. The encounter with Renee Zellwegger outlined on pages 144-146 (complete with photo copy of a note she gave him) is the most glaring example of this.   -His mentioning more of the great things he did "in spirit", such as throwing away a mashed up burger he saw on the floor of a McDonald's, page 150 or so. I love how picking up a burger being trampled is heroic, but heneeds ourhelp in paying for his guru's home....      My point is made. There are other things, but honstly, I do not feel like looking for the page number, as I would have to skim the book again.  I am finding Dyer to be more annoying as time goes on. By his own advice about annoying people, I should send himthoughts of love. I would do so, in proportion to how much this book annoyed me, but I also have a day job.   
 The game of golf is racist and sexist.  I get it.  In fact, I got it after the first twenty times Sounes whines about it 
 The original title is "The round towers of Ireland". After having skimmed through the book three times now I have still not seen any mentioning of Atlantis. Why skimming? Because it is so full of italics and emphasis that it gets tiring very quickly, especially since most of it is wrong anyway.   This book is not worth the investment, and if you found it when looking for Atlantis books, I STRONGLY encourage you to keep looking 
 Why do I own a thunderstorm CD? I don't know. I guess I thought it would be something different, something ambient and *natural.* This disc has one long, poorly-recorded thunderstorm, followed by 23 lighting strikes. None of it is worth buying or hearing 
 Sorry for this but I did not get this product from you. If you could write to me 
 I received this book as a Christmas gift this year because it was on my list and, based on the online reviews, it looked as if it would be just what I was looking for.  I am used to cooking with "exotic" ingredients such as umboshi plum paste, nutritional yeast, agar agar, and miso but there were ingredients in this book I would not go out of my way to buy given the meager amounts in the recipes.  I am speaking about hing, which according to the author is so smelly she keeps it in the garage. I haven't seen a recipe yet in this book that called for more than 1/4 teaspoon of the stuff. If she had offered a substitute, I wouldn't have been so turned off.  There were also the pickled nasturtium buds (she did mention capers as a substitute) and dried tofu skins, which can be hard to find.  There is one recipe in the book for "Soy puree" except instead of soybeans, she has chickpeas listed. Chickpeas are NOT soy.  I'm a pretty seasoned cook (pun intended) and I really wanted to like this book but alot of the recipes just didn't sound very appetizing. For example, she gives you her recipe for one of her favorite soups: Kale and Bean Curd. Its nothing more than water, miso and kale. No depth of flavor, no aromatics, no complexity- just boring.    I think that this is a book for the unsophisticated vegetarian palate. I believe that if you enjoy more complex flavors and consider yourself a gourmet or a foodie you will be highly disappointed.    I think Joanne Stepaniak, Paulette Mitchell, Mollie Katzen and Deborah Madison do a much better job 
 Unless you are a child of an alcoholic or grew up in this type of environment, I would not recommend this book. There are other types of dysfunctional families but they are not discussed in as much detail as alcoholics 
 could not wait to get my hands on this new mcallister book, the previous efforts being so entertaining & w/such superb character development. this one was all over the map as i guess even the best writers experience a "hiccup" now & again! certainly NOT worth the price of admission 
 This book is filled with interesting stories. It is also filled with many, many unforgiveable mistakes. Previous reviews have pointed out the mistake of Panzer means panther in German...come on! But towards the end of the book it refers to Hermann Goering as Hitler's propaganda minister. Wow, where was the editor on that one. I think Joseph Goebbels would have something to say about that. And if Goering was hard at work on propaganda, who was running the Luftwaffe? It moves on to talk about Hitler's suicide by poison in the Bunker. Except that Hitler shot himself in the temple, prefering a soldiers death. Yes Hitler did have a poison pill in his mouth, but that was only as backup in case the shot was not fatal. The book is filled with stuff like this.   I started reading this book with great excitement because the subject matter is fascinating and I have not heard about the 761st Battalion. I was hoping this book would be breaking new ground. But instead I find myself NOT trusting any of the information in this book since they obviously don't even know who Hermann Goering was.   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and 761st Battalion should get an apology from coauther Anthony Walton and the Editor of this book 
 These are, for the most part, slight pieces, a somewhat haphazard collection mostly lacking thematic unity. By slight, I mean that Shermer did not provide me with much new information or many new insights into old information.  There's an account of his experience impersonating a variety of psychics; an attempt at a Darwinian interpretation of the mutiny on the "Bounty" which adds nothing, really, to what's been known for years; a thirteen-page essay called "Exorcising Laplace's Demon" in which Laplace appears only in the final paragraph; a series of top-whatever lists gathered from here and there for no very clear reason. And so on.  I would have saved myself a good deal of time if I had gone straight to page 173 ("The New New Creationism") and left it at that. This piece provides a ten-point rebuttal of the Intelligent Design argument that is useful for those of us who don't know much about this latest metamorphosis of creationism.  But by then Shermer's credibility was so damaged that even this piece I approach warily. Shermer the skeptic is so error-prone that his unintended effect is to make me skeptical of everything he says. His introduction indicates that many of these pieces have been previously published. This I find astonishing. The first chapter alone contains so many serious grammar errors that had Shermer submitted it when he was a high-school senior, at least where I grew up at about the same time period, he would have forfeited his diploma.  I'm not a scientist, and so when I find a science writer telling me that malaria is transmitted by "a virus-infested mosquito" (try "parasite" and "infected"); that helicobacter pylori is also a virus; that "flagella" is singular, I have to wonder what other nonsense is getting past me. Evidently fact checkers and proof readers have gone extinct.  In general, Shermer's essays lack structure, focus, and creative insight. To be an essayist is to be a type of poet. An accomplished essayist - Oliver Sacks, for example -  takes an idea, a fact, an observation perhaps, and in elegant, graceful language explores it, expands it, teases it out until we are astonished and delighted by the insights, the connections, and by a new way of seeing our world. This is an art, and Michael Shermer, sadly, is only a fledging artist 
 It can indeed be extremely stressful for a Japanese speaking foreigner working at a Japanese company in Japan. I say this from direct personal experience. But my impression is that the author's only skill was the ability to speak Japanese. She had no basic office skills e.g. she was unable to perform simple calculations. And she had neither business training nor business experience. Amelie Nouthomb's degree was in philology not business or economics or finance. This being the case she was unqualified to perform any complex tasks. Little wonder that her brief experience of working in Japan was such a disaster. 
 A handle was missing - the box was retaped - may be a return from a store, etc. Overall, the item is chintzy - you have to assemble it. The charcoal pan is painted black - this will burn off slowly. I am going to assemble it, but this item, when shipping is included, is a total ripoff. John  
 Samantha seems a lot like Becky.  A young woman whose life is very out of balance and doesn't know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions.  Instead of staying at the firm and working out her "mistake," she runs away.  This is just like Becky hiding her bills.  And then she gets a totally implausible job, because she can't tell the truth - again like Becky.  Samantha doesn't tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to.  I agree that the firm would never have taken her back; they probably would have viewed her as a former lawyer who had a nervous breakdown and was in need of psychiatric care.  Samatha, like Becky at times, seems somewhat manic, in that she's frantic somtimes and makes major life decisions on impulse in a state of agitation.  just like Becky when she rushes after her sister on a hike for which she is totally unprepared.  Lithium, anyone?  I don't have an opinion on the housewife/lawyer "controversy," but I do think Kinsella's protagonists need to grow up 
 I'm not sure who these people are that are rating this book so highly. This is probably the worst book written on the subject. Want to know how to implement a Tracking Service? How about a persistence service? Maybe you'd like to see a simple example of how to implement workflow? Well if so, then DON'T get this book. This book tells you none of this. This book is about what's under the hood. It's similar to seeing what's under the hood of IIS or Exchange. Who cares? I want to know how to use it, not how pretty the system is. I would return this book in an instant if I could.   
 I think this book took me five minutes to read--a lot of talking, no ideas.  Original ones, anyway 
 If you don't understand Russian and going to follow subtitles - this one is for you. The DVD quality is perfect (I'm not gonna say anything about the movie - lots of reviews here). But the fact that amazon said it is Russian but it turned out to be Chezh made me sad. 
 The book does a good job in illustrating why the little things we do is important in creating return sales but it does not dive into the world of industrial sales.  The customer of this book is most often the retail consumer.  The world of customer loyalty in industrial relationships is motivated by different needs and not addressed by this book 
 Really was looking forward to an awesome instrumental album, and did not get what I had anticipated.  Co-produced by Bruce Boullet (also of Racer X fame).  I have only listened to this CD once, and will try again, but it's  painful to listen to what seems like a regression in talent from when paul  was in the 18-23 year old days.  Racer X lives on......... 
  Physical labor sucks.  Okay, you know that, I know that, even Paris and Nicole (thanks to their reality show) have gotten it through their puny little brainage, but it's news to Barbara Ehrenreich, whose previous stints as Ph.D earner, activist and writer did not expose her to the grubby working world of dirty hands and aching muscles that most of us have managed to live through.   It's a shame. This could have been such a great book, but B.E.'s got a preconceived agenda (welfare reform is never gonna work!) and an axe to grind (unless we raise minimum wage to 14 bucks an hour!).  To prove her point she goes undercover for the better part of a year, taking entry-level, low-skilled work while staying in expensive short-term housing. Of course, she could of just crunched numbers -"Let's see, 7 bucks an hour times 40 hours, while my pretend rent is $200 a week...carry the zero...nope, can't afford it" - but that would have just given her a puny little 2,000 word article for Mother Jones.  Book deals, on the hand, require more work, more commitment, but think of the royalties, so off she goes, just like Paris and Nicole, to work as a waitress, maid and Wal-Mart associate.  At least until it gets too hard.  B.E.'s got a litany of complaints - my feet hurt, my back hurts, piss tests are demeaning, my boss is a jerk, customers are rude, my back huuuurts - and seems to think that only the minimum wager has to suffer such indignities.  News flash, Barbara!  Every job is stressful in its own way.  I'm a RN and it's a rare day I don't come home feeling like I've been beat with a stick.  I've been verbally abused and cussed out more times than I can remember, and that's just by the docs.  I've been pee'd on, poo'd on, run ragged, and called  "girl" by my stupidvisor (My response: I'm older than you, and I've had sex, and I'm pretty sure you haven't by the looks of you, so, boss, who's the "girl" here, and who's the WOMAN.)  I will admit I get paid significantly more for my putting-up-with-BS than the average Walmartian does for his.  But then again I earned a college degree, I had to pass a difficult competency test and I work under the constraints of my nursing license, for which I had to get fingerprinted and background checked.  So that's why I get paid more than a minimum wager, even though our jobs, probably 97% of the time, are comparable.  I'll give B.E. 2 stars for her writing.   It's smart and witty and at times, she borders on hilarious, especially when she's mocking the minorities and poor that she claims to want to help.  Hey, I didn't say she was compassionate, I said she was funny.    B.E., if you're reading this, consider this angle next time you want to write a book about not getting by.  Write a book about being poor and uninsured.  Write a book about wanting to advance your position in life, but not being able to, because as soon as you take that better paying job or go into business for yourself you'll be kicked off medicaid, and you'll run out of inhalers for your asthmatic kid, and you'll have to listen to him wheeze all night, and when you take him to the charity clinic a week from Tuesday, because that's the only time the retired charity doc can see you, you won't be able to afford the prescription since it's over a hundred bucks for one inhaler, so then you have to quit your job so you can qualify for medicaid.  Then when you're done with that, write another book, this time about the lack of decent public transportation in the majority of the U.S., and how this results in needing a car to survive, which leads to excessive personal income spent on cars, more tax money spent on roads and highways, to say nothing of the hidden costs of car accidents and obesity from driving everywhere because it's too dangerous, with all the cars on the road, to ride a bike.  Those books would be worth reading.   
 This book is purely a self-promoting guide for the company that put it out.  While there's some useful information for the pre-first timer (such as your truly), the "book" exclusively focuses on their services.  If you are interested in self publishing, there are other books, such as the more independent "Complete Idiot's Guide to Self Publishing," available for not much more in cost than this book - although if you decide to go with Outskirts Press, the print edition of this "book" gives you a small discount - more than covering the cost of this "book" - towards one of their publishing packages.  BTW, this guide is available in PDF format from the company on their website.  You just need to give them your first name and e-mail address to download the e-book 
 I am a third generation Christian Scientist and, contrary to what some reviewers have written, my church does not forbid me from reading what I want or seeking medical attention if that is my choice. Consequently, I read Ms. Fraser's book with interest. Like the author, I remember well my childhood in Christian Science. Unlike Ms. Fraser, though, I have nothing but wonderful memories of two loving and dedicated parents and a host of Sunday School teachers and friends who worked diligently to practice their faith. I know of several instances in which church members and people in my own family consulted medical doctors and in many of those cases it was Christian Science, not allopathic medicine, that healed. How can this be explained? And why is it that C.S. cannot be considered "Christian" when Jesus Christ Himself used no medicine nor consulted doctors to do the things He did? And didn't He say that the works He did we could do, too? What's that about if not turning to God in the FIRST instance for help rather than reserving such power as a last resort? And what of the children who have died under the care of Christian Scientists? What of the many, many more who have died at the hands of well-meaning doctors who, being all too human, often make mistakes. Witness the many news articles about mistakes involving vaccinations, clerical errors, misdiagnoses, amputations of incorrect body parts, and unproven therapies. And let's not forget all the so-called FDA approved drugs that later turn out to produce side effects equal to or worse than the disease they're supposed to cure! Tell me conventional medicine is the way to go? Even if I wasn't a C.S. I'd still be mighty reluctant to go the allopathic route. Why would I put my life in the hands of a mere mortal, no matter how well-educated, when I could put it back in the hands of the One who gave it to me to start with? Sort of like going to a shade-tree mechanic to fix a car problem that ought to be handled by the manufacturer.  If you really want to know what Christian Science is all about, and if you really want to know what Mary Baker Eddy said and did, talk to practicing C.S.'ists! Read Mrs. Eddy's voluminous writings on the subject. Read the writings of those who knew her and worked with her. And while you're at it, check out some of the secular quantum physics research currently underway that is exploding the notion of matter as substantial and "real." But if you'd rather cling to half-truths and factual twisting born of personal grudge and bias, then by all means make Ms. Fraser's book your gospel. Her historical facts may be straight on, but her presentation of them is tired and rife with the cliches about this religion that have been around since Mrs. Eddy's day. Christian Science has failed some but helped countless others. If you don't pay attention to the success stories, then you're not getting the full story. Reasoned and intelligent people know there are always two sides, and they take the time to investigate both 
 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 I loved "The RM" and expected the same level out of this movie, but my husband's whole family agreed to turn it off during the bathroom scene and never watched the rest.  The teenagers didn't even want to check it out after that scene.  They also loved "The RM".  If you can get it from the library go ahead, but don't spend money on it 
 I'm sorry to be the first one to write a one-star review of this CD, but I cannot give it anything else. After reading the encomiums of previous reviewers, I had high hopes for this. On first listen, you laugh, simply because of the silly, slightly ridiculous ambience that is created. A little entertaining, in fact. However, as one progresses, you find out this sad fact: Paolo Conte doesn't SING! He declaims in a kind of sprechstimme, parlando fashion, very much as Rex Harrison did throughout 'My Fair Lady'. Thus to term Mr. Conte a crooner is a great disservice to the real crooners such as Tony Bennett, or Mel Torme. Yes, there is a certain mood and spirit to his work, but it's not a cd that grabs you and holds you. In short order, the stuff becomes somewhat annoying. If you want true Italian music from someone who actually sings, get Giuseppe di Stefano singing Neapolitan Songs, or even Sergio Franchi doing his thing. 
 Up front, I have to say that even though these discs appear as legitimately pressed DVD-5 silver discs, the facts are:  1) Paramount owns the right to this film in North America, and the movie has been well-restored. 2) These Region 0 Korean discs are converted from sped-up PAL video sources 3) The disc's bitrate is extremely low - the total size of all files is under 3GB, and the video is very grainy. 4) The artwork says the film is letterboxed, but the film is shot full-frame 1.33:1, and presented as such.  The only thing that would make this any more obvious is if the disc was made using DVD-R blank discs.  Do not support bootleggers!  Yes, the movie is a classic, but I am not rating the movie, only the rip-off masquerading as a legitimate release 
 Stack was chosen to lead a former International Harvester plant that was nearly bankrupt.  Instead of massive layoffs he focused on rapidly increasing sales and obtaining employee involvement through opening the books.  Sounds too good to be true.  Large unions have had open books for years - yet, G.M., Ford, etc. have not benefited to any great extent.  The REAL problem in business today is "meeting the China price."  To my knowledge China is only just now looking into diesel engine remanufacturing (Springfield Remanufacturing's business).  We'll soon see how effective open books are in combating competition paying only 5-10% of American wages.  If they fail, open books will have proven to be a fatal distraction.  On the other hand, "open books" doesn't hurt, is somewhat helpful, and may be wonderful for firms not facing intense price competition.  (Several Internet searches on Springfield Remanufacturing were unsuccessful in obtaining latest financial performance data - I'm not even certain it still exists.) 
 Having never read a book by Danielle Steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels, I was looking forward to reading Answered Prayers, since I usually always find the books more deep and interesting. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed... The first thing that bothered me about this novel, was the amount of repetition it has. I was just through the first few pages of the first chapter, and I was already being told things (usually insignificant) which I had just read a few lines before.  Secondly, the moment Brad is introduced into the plot, I could foresee with certainty, how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end. So as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading, I reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable, the book couldn't possibly be Danielle Steel's "Number One Bestseller" as the cover proclaims...seems like I have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a "bestseller".  The major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination. Even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other. Faith is sweet and caring, has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving her feeling lonely and sad. Her husband is cold, unreligious and gives her no attention.  Brad is sweet and caring, has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving him feeling lonely and sad. His wife is cold, unreligious and gives him no attention. Even Faith's "deep dark secret" is too unoriginal, and it is revealed to the reader at the very early stages of the book, leaving no room for curiosity and suspense.  Halfway through the book, I was so bored that I considered giving up reading it altogether. However I kept pushing on, praying that some twist to the plot would miraculously materialize somewhere, to at least make reading Answered Prayers worthwhile... Unlike Faith however, my prayers remained unanswered... It's going to require a lot of will power to attempt reading a Danielle Steel novel again...

 Save your money.  I gave up halfway through and shredded the DVD.  Amanda Peet was great in "Saving Silverman", but she should be mortified by this movie.  "Whipped" was probably written by two fifteen-year-olds on their junior high lunch break.  Absolutely abysmal 
 I used this book as a text in a college heat and mass transfer and despite an overall 3.9 gpa, I managed to fail this class.  The book is completely unclear and utterly impossible to decipher.  Stay away from this book 
 The works of E.A. Wallis Budge were out of date before they were even published. His sole gift to Egyptology was the popularisation of the field, leading at the least to extended availability of funding. While interesting  as a piece of scholarly history, no beginner should work from this book  alone; Budge's understanding of the language is fallible to a degree that  would forever mar the education of the casual student in the Egyptian  language. My suggestion would be James Allen's new "Middle  Egyptian", if not Gardiner 
         Warning: this review reveals many things about the book but nothing about the movie. I don't know how they could say that this movie is based on the book. The only thing that is really the same is the burglary in the beginning. I know how movies based on books how to cut out many parts to make it fit until the right amount of time but i never thought that they could take out the main charactor and hero. Jack Graham was the best part of the book and Clint Eastwood cut him out to make himself the main charactor. Also they made the billionare Walter Sulivan seem like a complete idiot because Luther had to tell him who killed his wife. Sulivan was a very smart man and figured it out by himself. This movie cut out many important factors of the book that made it more suspenseful. Deaths like: Walter Sulivan, Luther Whitney, Sandy Lord, Sandy Lord's mistress, and Bill Burton. I am suprised that they even killed Christy Sulivan in the first place. Also they left out many key elements of the book such as: Jack for a big one, Russell and Collin's affair, the knife being destroyed, everyones death that I mentioned before, and Kate's relationship with her father.       This movie pissed me off very much becuase it left out all of the suspence that Baldacci put in. I mean when Luther kills Collin it sounds like something straight out of Dirty Hairy "Mercy," said Collin "I fresh out," replied Luther. I mean come it's cool for an action movie with no plot but this book is one of my favorites and the movie ruined my mental image of it. Don't see the movie but I recommend the book 
  Yes, this is the great PBBB's 2nd album, but it's not the CD you should be buying.  This domestic CD was released in 1990 and has never been remastered.    The import 2CD version of this title (backed with the PBBB's 1st album) is the one to get.  It was remastered by Bob Irwin in 2001.  Ditto for "Pigboy Crabshaw" & "In My Own Dream"; the 2004 import 2CD is also remastered (and sounds incredible) and the domestic CD's are not.  Why WEA and Elektra have not made these four remasters available domestically is a mystery.  Don't waste your money on these inferior versions: Get the imports 
 Amazing how a writer can attempt to make an immoral organization, the corporation, look moral. Only someone like Al Capone could sympathize with this group on the Oregon. How can anyone justify having the sort of firepower as is on the Oregon. The US apparently is willing to finance the group, but the US also financed Sadam, Noriega, ... Unfortunately, in this sense it is too much like real American policy, which absolutely disgusts me (the ends justify the ends no matter how many bodies are left behind, as long as they are not righteous Americans). The characters are clichï¿½, there is no suspense since everything goes as planned, and anyone in the crew can just about do anything, including being a successful rock band. It makes me look back on the Dirk Pitt books and wonder about Dirk's morality 
 This movie was made in 2002, if you watch the extra behind the scenes stuff Rachel Skarsten mentions she filmed her pilot for Birds of Prey earlier in the year which was done in 2002.  Nice little horror movie, somewhat creepy but no gore or sex or slasher blood. Just good suspense of the old kind.  I rented this because of Rachel Skarsten, it's one of the few movies she has done and was impressed with her character. Liked how she calmed the boy down and was supportive instead of condemming 
 I bought this oven for my children. After I lugged it home, my wife, an aspiring novelist, told me that "It was a quear, sultry summer, the summer they electrocuted the Rosenbergs, and I didn't know what I was doing in New York." I said "Don't you like the kid's new stove?" She replied, "How frail the human heart must be - a mirrored pool of thought. "  I left it at that, and cooked some macaroni and cheese for dinner, after a good cigar and a glass of Weller's, I came back into the kitchen, only to discover....well, that's a long story, I just hope you realize this ain't no kids stove, it's the real deal, bud. Chance rules every corner of the universe except the chambers of the human heart 
 The few that I liked use either very thick or very thin yarns. The capelets (shortie capes) definitely don't interest me. The photos are nice. Maybe something will inspire me, but I doubt if I'll be making anything from this book. So far it's the worst poncho book I've bought. 
 This book is outdated, outmoded, and nearly useless.  It contains tons of information on how to manipulate fabrics that aren't even in use anymore. Hardly anything on dealing with knit fabrics, which look better and are easier to manipulate. Ask anyone under 50 if they have ever seen any darts in their clothes? And all this slashing and turning and manipulating??? not only is it sloppy, its useless, Useless, USELESS! Lots of money spent for vague instructions on basic blocks, and only clothes made in the 80's. Save eyour money, just because this book is expensive, doesn't make it useful 
 As the title says - don't waste your money on this book.  I do not understand the humor in this book.  I thought this was to be an entertaining and helpful book for persons interested in learning the art of hospitality.  There is very little useful information in the book and the oddly inserted humor is distracting.  The author has a thing about teeth (or one tooth)- I don't understand how this relates to the topic at hand.  Also the pictures are from a different era and not inviting nor do they enhance the message.  I find dirty recipe cards unappealing - I don't want to make the food when I have to look at a stained recipe card.  The vagina information has no place in this type of book and detracts from the hospitality message. I really don't understand the purpose of putting it into this book.  The book is not useful as an entertaining guide and not funny as a comedy piece.  
 Being an avid enthusiast of the drum n' bass "scene," as pretentious as it occasionally sometimes is, in listening to this Cd I feel this is not a strong representation of the genre. This could very well be  personal, (so you headz chill) but this type of jazzy, tech-step like, a  cappella jam seems occasionally cheesy and filled  with..well..."filler."  I realize that during 1998 this was where  it was at for Grooverider. He was hardly setting off bombs in the d n b  fabric with other producers overshadowing his less-than-fresh efforts.   This album has a few choice cuts, and his production skills are  commendable, but combining so-called jazz harmonies with this type of genre  is definately an abuse of power.  The loungy progressions are worn thick,  and lacking any true creativity deep down.  This album comes nowhere near  stuff on the "Prototype Years" ep which was showcasing the fine  talents of heavy hitters Dillinja, Ed Rush, Fierce, Lemon D, Optical, and  Boymerang, to name a few.  It goes without saying that Grooverider has been  one of the most respected and talented DJ's, probably getting all of these  afforementioned producers their starts.  A big name gets alot of support   and can get away unscathed by negativity due to that stardom.  No one would  dare defy that Grooverider's attempt at making d n b is off key, but let's  not give in to someone's production skills because they are graciously  empowered in the scene like a king.  Purveyor's of fine drum n' bass can  find sanctuary elsewhere.  Stick with your records for the best 
 The show is formed by good actors and Pamela is stunning in it, bringing FUN and LIGHT to the stories. However, it is not funny enough. It tries really hard to be, but, overall, it's all about weak and - only sometimes - witty jokes 
 Hagiographies were, historically, written for the edification of the faithful.  That describes this disappointing work rather well:  for those who wish to hear only the positive, and the classic story of repentance and redemption, the basic story is competently told, and it will, perhaps, serve its purpose.  But it offers little or nothing to the thinking Christian (or non-) reader:  there is little or no critical evaluation of Colson and his story and (disappointing to this reader) little too on the remarkable movement that he has been so involved in creating and leading, Prison Fellowship.  Colson's is an inspiring story, but little or no purpose is served by setting him up as a plaster saint.  There is a fascinating tale to be told, and real Christians still struggle today with the moral ambiguities and compromises of life in the world's centres of power.  Sadly, this book is not the one for them 
 I found myself continually frustrated with the stupid actions of Miss Zukas, constantly putting herself in harm's way 
 I have read all of the series, always hoping that someway somehow the author will launch her easy going characters into the current decade. Having the main character go back and forth between two suitors is boring and unrealistic. It needs to be settled already. If you must know the greatest escapades of the Lake Eden clan then do yourself a favor, borrow it from the library. Hopefully, her next book will be a more realistic ode to the state of Minnesota 
 I could present this book with a serous analysis, but even the fair and balance New York Times ignores O'Reilly books in their review section.  Bill being this untimate pitchman should check the demographics for his show.  It would demonstrate that the average age for the No Spin Show is over seventy years old.  Which is why is his ratings are declining this past year, his viewer are dying of natural cause.  I suggest his next book be titled "The O'Reilly Factor For Nursing Home Residents". 
      I agree with some of the less favorable reviews.  Many of the people in the book came from big named schools and were very well off financially before thinking about a life change.  Some of the stories left you wondering what happened.  And so many of the stories were just not long enough to really provide useful insight into anyone's life.  It was like Po had a stopwatch set for 30 minutes and told each person he interviewed to tell them a little about themselves and their career path.      I'm a recent graduate from a non ivy league school.  After majoring in Business, I've been struggling to just simply get experience in the areas of business I like (or any area at this point).  I thought this book would provide stories to which I could relate, but for the most part there were none.  I was hoping for some inspirational stories on what steps I could take to find the right job that would lead to the right opportunities that would make me happy and financially secure.  Instead, many of the people would make tons of money and then simplify their lives by baking cakes or opening a catfish farm which is fine when you're already financially secure.  That also was annoying.  It always seemed like people in the book had to make less money to be happier.  I understand that makes sense in some cases, but the book made it seem like it was the only way.  Even Po kept talking about how he could have made 300 grand a year, but decided against it.  Isn't it possible your calling could lead you to more money?  I am not selfish, money is not everything to me, but I do understand that you do in fact need it.      I gave this book 2 stars, because there was one quote that I did like and made sense to me.  "The true search is what you believe in."  As opposed to only looking at what you're good at.  I think the book needed much more inspirational insight like this.  There were a few other parts of the book that provoked some deep thought, but unfortunately it was more miss then hit.  I wish I could give it 2 1/2 stars, because that would better demonstrate just how down the middle, okay, and simply average the book was.  Don't buy this book expecting it to be an eye opener.      Lets face it, the question "What should I do with my life?" can never be truely anwsered.  It's like pondering about god or the universe.  I just wanted it to make me think "oh wow, that's an interesting way to think about it or approach that question."  Instead, I was almost always left thinking "Um okay, so did I miss something there?" 
 I like most of Jodi Picoult's books, but this was the worse one I have ever read. The story line was ridiculous and unbelievable. The main character in the book, Trixie, is a teenager with problems but her parents never seem to realize this. They go to incredible lengths to protect her and never hold her responsible for any of her actions. The drawings in the book were distracting and annoying. I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 I like to appreciate one's art and give everyone the benefit of the doubt.  Although Wearstler has the creative team to package her, her talent leaves me feeling short changed.    If you have seen one Wearstler design, you have seen them all.  Her style is the same regurgitated interpretation of the last.  However, I will say that her "Beverly Hills Estate" is probably the best work I have seen of hers.    This book is a little over the top.  I am a fan of Beverly Hills, I am from Beverly Hills, but you will not find a Beverly Hills woman or any other woman for that matter doing domestic chores in couture gowns.     I think it is interesting that most of her projects, even the ones featured in Modern Glamour, are her own residences or hotels.  I believe she lived in the Hillcrest/Trousdale Estate, Hollywood Compound and she even acknowledges the Hancock Park/Sycamore Street apartment.    Thank goodness for Brad...he is the one who purchases the hotels.    Even BG, the Bergdorf Goodman restaurant in NY, leaves me feeling uninspired.  Kudos to the ones behind the scenes - hotelier husband, decorator/designer mother, stylist, publicist and writer.  Kelly's contributions to that of a tastemaker are not up to par with her predecessors.  But you do have to give her credit for believing in herself 
 This book has an overview of diseases for most domestic large animals.  I found this text to be too general to be very helpful as a reference guide for folks needing all the details.  It does have some decent rule out lists.

 There are two good reasons why I oppose the concept of a completely Good, Omniscient, and Omnipotent (GOO) God:  (1) Acceptance of this God insists that the petty-minded cruelty of God as described in the Old Testament is actually love.  If Christians refuse to acknowledge that Moses invented the tradition of ethnic cleansing, and that this was evil, it is too easy to justify applying this concept to native Americans, Jews, and Moslems, as has been done throughout history, and  is being done at the present time.  (2)  Rejection of this God usually entails rejection of any notion of God, and acceptance of the doctrine that we are merely machines whose existence is accidental.  So while I cannot pretend that I studied Plantinga's attempt to reconcile God and evil with an open mind, I tried to be at least fair.  His argument not only fails, it is silly.  I shall explain why as briefly as I can.  The analogies that Plantinga chooses to support his case are odd to say the least.  The fact that a theist does not know why God permits evil says nothing about the rationality of the belief.  We also do not know how the desire to mow the lawn leads to the bodily motions of mowing the lawn, yet it is rational to suppose there is a connection.  True, but if the desire mow the lawn led instead to sticking one's hands in the whirling blades and hacking them off, we would consider that irrational.    Since God is GOO, he will eliminate all evil that he can that does not entail eliminating an outweighing good or bringing about a greater evil.  Suppose I am deliriously happy, and my friend Paul has a sore knee.  God cannot eliminate Paul's pain without also eliminating my happiness.  It's impossible to imagine why God cannot do this, unless Paul's pain makes me happy.  Admitting this example to be trivial, Plantinga suggests that heroism in the face of evil is inspirational, and this heroism would be eliminated by the absence of evil.  Facing evil with heroism is good, but the absence of evil is clearly better.    The good that prevents God from eliminating evil is free will.  Since no argument can be better than its major premise, free will needs to be scrutinized.  Inasmuch as nearly all atheists dismiss free will as a delusion, Plantinga's argument is obviously not meant for them.  My conviction is that free will does exist, but only in the same way that the ability to do calculus exists; it requires a lot of hard work and few people ever develop it to any extent.  At best, one's free will is confined within the limits of one's character, and Plantinga's claim that predictability has nothing to do with free will is clearly false.  For instance, the average white man in 1850's Georgia insisted that slavery was completely consistent with Christian morality and no rational argument could have convinced him otherwise, while the opposite would have been true for his counterpart in Maine.  People with free will do not permit their characters to be molded by arbitrary cultural circumstances.  We might be free to do what we want, but is what we want really a free will choice?  Christians acknowledge that wanting to sin is beyond their control.  But only evil people want to do heinous things.  How many men want to crush a woman's skull with a tire iron and rape the corpse, as Ted Bundy did?  Was the desire to do this Bundy's free will choice?  Plantinga acknowledges that God might interfere with Maurice's decision to have oatmeal for breakfast by inflicting him with an equine obsession that makes it psychologically impossible for him to refuse oats.  I am by no means convinced that Bundy did not suffer from a more sinister obsession.    At any rate, since God knows who will "choose" to become evil, why not NOT CREATE THOSE PEOPLE?  Plantinga ignores this question.  He says, "God could not have created any of the possible worlds containing just the persons who do in fact exist, and containing moral good but no moral evil" (p.48).  He claims that God cannot create a world in which people do not have "transworld depravity."  I had to reread Plantinga's explanation of transworld depravity several times before I could convince myself that he actually says what he actually says.  Stripped of the obfuscating logical symbols of which he is so fond it goes like this:  There are two worlds identical in every way except in one Bundy kills the woman, and in the other he doesn't.  But if the world in which he doesn't kill the woman is going to be as much like the actual world as possible, then if this world were actual, then he would have killed the woman.  It says nothing except that if Bundy actually exists, and he has free will, he must kill the girl.  It is a fatuous argument that never addresses why Bundy should be obsessed with evil in the first place.    Plantinga argues that natural disasters that we typically refer to as "acts of God" are actually the free will acts of demons.  Although earthquakes are explained quite well by plate tectonics, Plantinga insists it is not irrational to insist demons pushing the plates around.  This is so inane I cannot even comment on it.

 I was SO disappointed with this DVD.  Oh my goodness, it just rambled on for me and wasn't to the point.  I loved the film "What The Bleep?" and was looking for more.  I've just read "Ask and It Is Given" and am in the middle of the follow up book " The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent" both by Esther & Jerry Hicks (Abraham-Hicks).  I was abit reluctant to go down the road of "channels".  Abraham-Hicks have got my attention, they're written with grace.  I personally don't recommend this particular Ramtha DVD, perhaps there are others by Ramtha that are more engaging.. 
 Lets compare this against some of the other nominees for Album Del Año in Univision's Lo Nuestro Premios:  De Viaje - Sin Bandera (the Winner) - far better  Seduccion - Jennifer Peña - not a real strong contender, but an enjoyable CD  Paulatina - Paulina Rubio - OK, so I am male and Paulina es muy caliente, pero Pau-latina es increible.  I dont have anything against Ricky - pero este album simplemente no es su mejor.  Compra las canciones individuales "Tal Vez" y "Y Todo Queda En Nada" solamente porgue el album no es fuerte y Ricky puede hacer mucho mejor.  Can this compare to "Amar Sin Mentiras" from Marc Anthony?  I realize these two are not the same type of music, but Marc beats Ricky on every level with his recent level.  The problem is that Ricky is holding back.  The songs dont have the same intensity level as previous offerings.  Emilio needed to be more involved with this album.  Actually, this is probably a 2 1/2 star CD because "Tal Vez" is so sadly intense it is very enjoyable, but I expected better from someone who has successfully crossed into the US market.  Necessita Juanes antes de comprando este.    Da me el ultimo album de Ricky Martin, por favor.  No me gusta lo.  Lo siento. 
 The hype on the dust jacket refers to Kirk as widely learned, but when the historian turns in this survey of the West to the pages covering matters on which he himself is expert, he finds errors galore.  It may be true that  this book is a good introduction, but it should be understood not to be for  the educated.  In short, Kirk's failure to find success in academia was not  related to his political views, but to his rather shallow grasp of his  field -- history 
 I enjoy the genre of over the top gore comedy but this one didn't interest me.  The story was very slow paced and uninteresting with some pretty unimaginative gore.    It was also ridiculous and not in a comedic way but a 'that is stupid' way.  People are smashing through stone walls a lot.   The final 'ultra' gory finale really didn't interest me either.  Watch Troma's Terror Firmer or Citizen Toxie if you enjoy this type of movie.  Or wait for Poultrygeist which will probably be pretty Tromariffic.  I don't know when this was made but I would guess it has to be inspired by Troma.   I appreciate the effort but it didn't match let alone surpass Troma for gore comedy 
 This book is a scam perpetrated by Smitten and company to direct you to his own products.  The book is poorly written, and what educational info there is from Livermore could be handled in about 20 pages.  The rest is anecdotal, interesting at times but useless to trading knowledge.  The "Secret Market Key" is a bunch of price quotes which are neither enlightening nor relevant, since the stock market was a whole different animal back then.    It's all common knowledge stuff (Pivot points, ride the winners dump the losers, etc) repeated ad nauseum.  Buy it if you must but be prepared to feel like the proof of PT Barnum's adage 
 A poory written, racially charged work by a bitter, probably mentally ill schoolteacher that gives the illusion of having a "key" to historical development. In addition to the cycle of history thesis, he identifies eight civilizations and their birth to death cycle, Spengler points to a nation's "will" and race as the key to a "kultur's" success.   This is the sort of crank theory that held an appeal to National Socialists and amateur history buffs for whom decline mythology holds an attraction-- facts be damned.   Interesting as an historical footnote but dismissed by anyone with a serious foundation in history and historical analysis. 
 This is a messy book that succeeds (to the degree that it does so) despite its flaws.  Some of the subjects are covered well, some covered poorly, and even where there is coverage, the discussions are maddeningly inconsistent.  First, the good: author Otto Friedrich was energetic in finding many former residents of Berlin as sources for this work, and some of the best parts of the book are their colorful reminiscences of their lost and ruined city.  Friedrich also included interesting chapters about the social milieu of the time, particularly the cultural scene: classical music, drama and the nascent motion picture industry.  And there are some nice character sketches of some of the leading artists of the era: Lotte Lenya, Bertolt Brecht and various musicians.  In general, despite the crazy-quilt nature of the coverage, Friedrich is best on the social history aspects of Berlin.  Now, the bad:  The book is very scattershot, a mile wide, but mostly an inch deep.  For example, in the discussion of the German movie industry of the time, although Marlene Dietrich and Emil Jannings are discussed, Peter Lorre, Ernst Lubistch and F.W. Murnau are discussed only in passing.  Among the pictorial artists, George Grosz is covered and discussed, but Becker, Nolde and scores of other artists get superficial or non-existent coverage.  And maybe it is inevitable to try to discuss the tangled political history of the Weimar era and the rise of the Nazis in a history of Berlin, but Friedrich is not a professional historian, and his weaknesses in this area are glaring.  Any reader with even a passing interest in the Weimar era will find far better accounts of the politics of the period than Friedrich's book. And even if you grant that he needed to discuss the political events of the day in  his work, there's a lamentable lack of focus to his political coverage, which mirrors the overall unevenness of this work.  For example, his descriptions of the combat in the streets between the Freikorps and the Communists in the immediate post-war period have the freshness and vitality that come from the testimony of eyewitnesses, and they give the reader a sense for the chaos that became horrifyingly prevalent in Berlin.  But his discussion of Germany's policies toward the payment of reparations (the Dawes plan and the Young plan, etc.) is, at best, superficial and misleading.  If you read this book, you might consider reading the sections that deal with the social history of the period and just skipping (or finding better sources for) the political history. 
 I really wanted to like this book, but it's written in such a simplistic and unfocused way as to leave me very disappointed. The author barely scratches the surface of the many technologies/projects/events he covers, and I always felt cheated after finishing each chapter... thinking "That's IT?!"  Underground tech IS a very cool subject to write about, but the lack of information about the inner motivations and passions of these "garage warriors" leaves a glaring hole in the text. If you have a short attention span and hate to read long books, this book is easily absorbed in a few hours. This is NOT a deep exposition on underground tech; it is a quick overview for newbies. Considering that the audience for this subject would be (I assume) more literate that the national average, it's a shame that the writing seems to be limited to what a sixth-grader could easily digest.  I notice now that the price has now dropped to 10 bucks. At that price, it's more in line with the quantity/quantity of content provided, and could now be considered an "okay" value... just don't set your expectations too high. I know this was a fairly harsh review, but I really was disappointed that the amateurish quality of the writing didn't live up to the slick cover design. Don't judge a book by it's cover 
 I think I would've liked the book better if the author had said that it was "based on actual events". It read too much like a novel. While I have no problem with an author using creative license at times, some of the dialogue was too far fetched. I also found it impossible that he would know what the characters (for lack of a better term) were thinking, especially the target. There were at least two inconsistencies that I found. Not good. Makes you doubt the veracity of this version of the story. As a novel this would've worked. 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 This is a simplistic, out of date treatment of a diverse and rapidly changing field. It is a disappoint that Bar Yam failed to capture the depth of the field, instead offering a cursory look at, mostly, classical examples in which Bar Yam did not take part. I would prefer, instead, to see a leader in the field write such a text, such that I could be assured that details that were omitted were less relevant, not simply forgotten 
 Behan's book is currently out of print. Maybe I should say "mercifully." I found a copy on eBay. I enjoyed the first explanation of the central thesis (use the prey instinct to train you dog)  for the first chapter. Then the second chapter was the same, and the third  and so on. I desperately wanted to find out something PRACTICAL. Gentle  reader.., go ahead and jump to page 100 when you open this book. You won't  miss a thing. And Behan will tell you what you missed. How many times can  you say "harmony" and "prey instinct?&quot 
 I wonder why Katarina stirs clear about her real life and her close involvement with the Stasi, and how it ruined and destroyed people's lives, it would at least have made a more interesting read than this dull book.   Ho hum, it has been said that Ms. Witt was never a very naturally gifted figure skater, that even her wonderfully choreographed programs were never easy for her to do.   It's also rather odd that for such an unrepentant and strident communist to take advantage of all the opportunities western life has given her, but she doesn't seem in the least bit grateful. Everything is about her, her, her. Definitely NOT a good role model for young girls or women.   
 I am an avid reader and have never once submitted a book review.  However, after reading Botox Diaries, I felt compelled to write and warn you all that this book is dull, trite, and disjointed.  I love my "chick-lit" books, but Botox Diaries is a disgrace to this genre.  The plot is weak and unrealistic (even in light of the suspended disbelief one normally affords "lite & fun" books).  The plot is also disjointed, perhaps because two authors co-wrote this book.  The characters are shallow and excruciatingly dull.  Botox Diaries is absolutely the worst book I have ever read.  -- December 2005 Update:  My friend insisted on reading this book (ugh...despite my warnings!). Even though she was stuck in the airport for eight hours, she still couldn't bear to finish the book, because she found it so dull. She actually left it, half-read, at the airport 
 Verbose, annoyingly pedantic, and rarely to the point, this text is a disaster from start to finish. For students who have little to no research experience it will be overwhelming in detail (unless you find reading formal style manuals to be a joy). On the contrary, for the more seasoned researcher certain sections will likely appear dubious or downright wrong, insofar as the text has a strong bias towards a certain social scientific approach (which is subject to learned academic debate, a point students should be made aware of). It essentially presents the research process as take it or leave it, encouraging a investigative framework that leads to inevitably trite conclusions. Additionally, it reads like a car manual with many sections repeated verbatim when the need arises for them to be referenced a second time. Finally, it uses examples of students work that are of questionable quality as positive examples, rather than well written, notable published pieces.   In conclusion, this would never be an appropriate guide for a students at elite research universities, nor would it be an efficient approach for students at less vaunted programs. 
 First, I am an avid reader of Bill's books.  I am a fan of the Pocket Consultant series.  I am a Consultant for a large software firm that has a vested interest in Vista.   That being said, I can't have been more disappointed with the Vista Pocket Consultant.  The omissions are the problem here - as well as some factual inaccuracies.  The book was obviously written and vetted on code that wasn't done yet, as references to tools, dialogs and terms that changed in later RCs and RTM are rife in this book.  Ximage and ImageX are not the same thing, for example.  One exists as a tool for Vista deployment, the other is a tool used by a major computer OEM.  As to omissions - one of the main pillars of Vista and HOW it affects the Administrator is User Access Control.  Sadly, Bill gives only passing reference to UAC - with no real explanation for what it is and how it works.  Administrators need to know what UAC DOES, how it does it, and why it does it.  If a pillar of a piece of software is ignored, then the real value of the book is in question.  This would be similar to not covering NTFS, DACLS and ACEs in Windows NT, or Active Directory (at least to a level or degree that you knew what questions to ask) in Windows 2000.  Also not discussed is the subject of BitLocker.  Again, lack of reference is very frustrating, given who this book was aimed at.  Administrators are EXACTLY the people that need to know this information.  It should have been a `must have' in this book.  Discussion of the integrated firewall is lackluster and meager.  If the subject equaled new security feature in Vista, this book did not capture the details of what is important.  In my most humble opinion, this book is a rehash of the Windows XP Pocket Consultant, with new pictures and a `find and replace done - Windows XP to Windows Vista.    I had intended to buy a copy of this book for each of my client-administrators.  Then, I sat down with the book to find some of the key information that I knew that they would need to know OVER what they already knew from XP SP2.  I decided to recommend Mark Minasi and Byron Hynes' Administering Windows Vista Security: The Big Surprises because they touched on the most confusing and complicated issues in the new OS.  I will continue to look to Mr. Stanek in the future for good books - tactical and precise.  However, I know have reason to pause, as I have bought on sight before. 
 To begin with, we really don't need this kind of book, nor do we need those written by the Neo-Fats who wish to blame America for everything since Columbus sailed in 1492.  Does that mean that Mr. Prestowitz might have a point here and there? Possibly. But when the majority of the baby butchers of 9/11 were born to prosperous families like the Atta scum (daddy Atta blames America for his son's murderous tendencies) - or families like that of Vicente Fox that prospered thanks to America, to Coca-Cola, McDonalds, Starbucks and all of those evil American corporations, and still blame America for their poor campesinos (remember, Clyde, you were a trade representative), then I for one refuse to buy into this kind of fallacious argument.  Should Americans understand the world? Absolutely. Should we buy into their Hate America crapola. Not for one single second. If we do, then I will ask Mr. Prestowitz and "Compassionate Conservative" who blames an Israel for the Palestinians wanting to butcher women and children, - an Israel that recently smashed the homes of its own citizens instead of the PLO leaders, where they happen to reside. Because more than likely they live on Native American land that was taken by force. If so, kindly hand over the keys to the local Tribal council, dear sirs, and take your family back to Europe. I'm sure Clyde can find an ancestral home in Cracow or Lodz or Warsaw.  We are NOT a "rogue nation" nor should we carry a guilt trip about Kyoto, the Israelis, SAVAK, the division of Korea or any other tripe that Prestowitz or his similiar-minded friends on the Left wish for us to carry, namely Soros, Chomsky and Zinn. Thousands of American boys and girls laying beneath the soil in North Africa, Western Europe, the Pacific Islands have already paid the world's price. Not to mention those who have died in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. And if the masses of the world don't like it, too bad.  Seems Mr. Prestowitz didn't learn much from serving in the administration of a great American President. Care to blame him too, Clyde?  My Country, Right or Wrong - it does have a very nice ring to it. 
 For Matchboxes, very difficult to find and reasearch based on a proprietary numbering system.  Numbering system not clearly articulated in overview.  I had to purchase a new "Matchbox specific" guide from another publisher.  
 I picked up this memoir based on a blurb that mentioned the author's connection to the Stratford, Connecticut Shakespeare festival. Having had a single opportunity to attend this (Christopher Walken's Hamlet!) event, I was hoping for some insight and history of the event. Instead, I found out far too much about Smith's problems; of his difficulties coping with a family that was overwhelmed by having a severely disabled child in the home (Smith's sister), and very little about Stratford's festival. Well, shame on me for buying into a blurb, but I still found the book very disappointing. Focusing basically on his youth, and his later contributions to the community by running Shakespeare reading groups at senior centers in NYC, HAMLET'S DRESSER, needs far more Shakespeare. When Shakespeare does appear, the book comes to life. The joy senior citizens get from the reading groups, Smith's fascination with Shakespeare that led to a life immersed in his works, and especially in the sections where Smith discusses the actors he had an opportunity to work with is where this book truly becomes interesting. Katherine Hepburn, June Havoc, and Bert Lahr all make memorable appearances. The chapter where Smith discusses going on tour with Lahr gives the reader a wonderful glimpse into what it is like to work with a talented yet irascible actor on the road with all of its joys and pitfalls. Sadly, there are not enough of these journeys in this book. I feel some empathy for Smith's trials and tribulations, yet they didn't make for interesting reading. The troubled tales of his youth seem better suited to a therapist's office as opposed to a memoir. They truly pale in comparison to his tales of the theater, which when shared with the reader make for some fine storytelling. If the focus had stayed with Shakespeare and the theater I feel this could have been a wonderful book, as it stands it is a flawed a bit boring overall 
 At first, I felt some hope in this book.  King admits plainly that the "Gospel" of Mary "offers no new information about the historical Jesus."  Rather, this text "reflects concerns that make sense in a Gentile context," in particular, this Jesus tale derives from Platonic and Stoic thought.  Aside from admitting these obvious facts (which does not always happen when the subject is Gnostic texts), King remains a careful scholar, and some of the connections she draws are good.     But like so many others, she hypes her text by claiming it changes our understanding of early Christianity.  Here her argument becomes not only illogical, but repetitious, agenda driven, and, finally, tiresome.       Let me begin with the quote above.  Mary "offers no new information about the historical Jesus."  No honest historian would disagree.  Yet again and again, King emphasizes how radically Mary, and the Nag Hammadi texts, supposedly change the history and meaning of Christian origins.  She calls early Christians who follow the canonical story the "proto-orthodox."  Like Pagels, she imagines them weaving all kinds of political webs to create a canon and a creed that exclude works like this one.  Even such radical critics as Morton Smith, Robert Funk and John Crossan (not to mention more balanced historians) find tons of historical information about Jesus in the canonical Gospels, while King admits she finds none in Mary.  Yet not once does she consider the possibility that early Christians selected the Gospels they did because of this superiority.     Why should a historian berate early Christians for selecting texts that give factual historical information, and rejecting those that don't?  I kept waiting for her to consider this question, but she was too busy alleging dark political schemes to even bring it up, let alone answer it.     But evidence that the "proto-orthodox" cared about historical truth is before her eyes.  King emphasizes the contrast between Mary, the "model disciple," conduit for Jesus' secret (Gnostic, though she dislikes the term) teachings, and Peter, her "hot-headed" proto-orthodox foil.  King goes on and on about how wonderful Mary is -- "It is no accident that the Savior loved her more than the others," a love "based on his sure knowledge" of this "unflinching and steadfast disciple."  But tempestuous Peter is no Gnostic invention.  The canonical Gospels vividly portray his flaws -- and the leadership Jesus gave him.  What this points to is how dramatically different the canonical texts are -- the frank realism with which they depict Jesus, his disciples, the crowds, and his enemies, which has led many skeptics to conclude that the stories they relate are true.  But King is enthralled with her simple, black-hat / white-hat text, and never drops a hint that the richly ambiguous canonical texts might, for a historian, offer advantages.     And on it goes.  Following Koester, King equates Thomas and Q.  (In my book, Why the Jesus Seminar can't find Jesus, and Grandma Marshall Could, I show the two are radically different.)  She exagerates the gap between Jesus and the writing of the Gospels.  (A period of that might take a witness from youth to middle age.)  She overlooks the fact that the four Gospels were already accepted as authoritative (for good reason) early in the 2nd Century.     Pagels has argued that John invented the figure of "doubting Thomas" to undermine the "Thomas tradition."  In one of the most absurd passages of this book, King applies the same argument to Mary. "Mary's status is diminished in the Gospel of John in that she at first mistakes him for the gardener, and then when she does recognize his voice, she addresses him as 'Teacher' . . a relatively low standing on the hierarchical scale of Johannine Christological titles . . . The whole scene works to subordinate Mary's authority as a resurrection witness to that of the male disciples . . . "     What hooey.  John "disses" all the male disciples much worse than that.  Thomas doubts.  Peter denies.  Judas betrays.  All the rest desert.  Unlike Mary, John doesn't pretty up his favored disciples for the press.  And if he did want to undermine Mary, why did he make her the first witness to the resurrected Jesus?   And why, if the early Christians were so set on misogeny, or indifferent to the facts, do the Gospels they selected show Jesus (as Walter Wink points out) transcending the boundaries of gender roles in every single encounter with women in the canonical Gospels?  Such facts should force feminist scholars to admit the Gospel authors (and selectors) were either proto-feminists, or honest enough to present Jesus as he was, including (as Dan Brown put it!) as the original feminist.  But it is not King's purpose to affirm orthodoxy, and so she ignores evidence of this sort.     Some parts of this book are well-done.  The comparisons with other Gnostic literature and with Greek thought are interesting.     But I am tired of this over-clever deconstructionistic mumbo-jumbo.  I rue the day the academy decided history could be done by such methods, as subjective as divination by tortoise shell, as easy (because impossible to disprove) as reading the mind of a person dead two thousand years.  If you want a serious reconstruction of early Christian history, avoid American profs entirely, and read N. T. Wright.    
 This CD is not at all what it appears to be. They got other people singing and playing the music, so it's not what you're probably looking for. Terrible misrespresentation. I was so disappointed! Thank goodness I used my other party cd's or my guests would have left......and I would have held the door open.....not blamed them for leaving! 
 I loved every DMB album up until this one. After 10 years of making the most profoundly wonderful music, the law of averages has finally kicked in for Dave and crew. I have been a fan since 1997 and loved everything about this band. Every album and every song was superb!   This album is a HUGH departure from the tradition Dave Matthews Band that all true DMB fans know and love. This album has also made a division between old hardcore DMB fans (fans of the REAL band that includes all 5 members) and new DMB fans (the "I heard it on the radio and liked it" fans)  This album does not include all 5 members as Leroi and Boyd are almost non-existent leaving just the guitar, bass, and drums ie. the meat and potatoes of a band. Every band has a guitar, bass and drums making them sound just about like every other band out there. Now how many bands do you know that have a fiddle and a sax/wind instruments in them? DMB used to be one of them. You won't find the adrenaline pumping fiddle solos or the heartfelt wind work on this album.  Next we have Dave playing electric guitar and co-writing the majority of the songs over a weekend and boy does it show. He co-wrote these songs with the new producer Glenn Ballard who plays piano on this one as well. The only song that is a work of art lyrically is The Space Between. I also like Everyday as well only because its an evolved form of a true DMB song, #36 (Hani Hani). This one is a real treat to see live as the band will sometime play both #36 and Everyday together.  Yes I will say again...Dave plays an electric on this one. Big mistake going from what your traditionally known as being acoustic then going directly to electric...just ask Dylan about this one. I felt like I Did It was an assault on my ears and took my breath away and not in a good way. My jaw dropped to the floor in disbelief and I just could not believe what I was hearing. This was not Dave Matthews Band! The only song that the electric worked with was The Space Between due to it being a dark and sad ending to a relationship. GREAT poetry and lyrics to that one and that song saves the a star from being a 1/5.  There are a lot of reviews on here that are saying that it took a few listens before they really liked it. I believe that these are fans that are just in denial and I can't blame them. Did it take a few listens before you fell in love with this band? When I first heard Crash Into Me and Too Much I was just floored and could not believe the sounds I was hearing. Not with this so called DMB. A band with a sax and a fiddle that makes it work!!?? WOW!   Take the 4 things out that make DMB, DMB and you get a mediocre any band. The 4 things that make the formula of Dave Matthews Band work are the uplifting and awe inspiring explosive fiddle solos from Boyd (Ants Marching), the emotional wind works of Leroi (Say Goodbye), Dave's lyrics (#41 and I'm not a big fan of Dave's vocals but thats on every album...I wish they would put out an all instrumental album), and the tricky timings, rhythms, and beats of Carter (#36 Live at Red Rocks), all of which pretty much do not exist on this album.  This is not DMB and if you do buy it at least you won't buy it under the false pretense that your buying a DMB album. Go get any other album besides this and Stand Up (which is even more disappointing then Everyday)  Hardcore DMB fans...you have been warned 
 Maybe it's just the geek in me crying out for mercy, but I find a lot of the details of this book pretty far-fetched.  Plus, after we figured out whodunit and such, it just seemed to drag on forever.  I ended up skimming the last 30 pages or so just to get it over with.  I thought it was OK, but it definitely caters to a less technically savvy audience than I : 
 I come from a swimming background, and I am focusing my training on the improvement of my biking and running skills.  I still like to spend about half of my weekly exercise time in the pool.  If you enjoy swimming, avoid this book.  It is for the pool-fearing 
 After reading "The Devil Went Down to Austin" I was excited to discover Rick Riordan.  Good writing and well-drawn characters.  Cold Springs was a huge disappointment. The characters were neither very believeable nor were they likeable. Chadwick just didn't ring true and the daughters? -- tell me again why copying Katherine's addictive behavior was so compelling to Mallory? The story was a muddle. 
 My overall recommendation is to read Bryson's brilliantly funny recent works, then go back to less recent works, then stop before you get to this one.  As other discerning reviewers have noted (especially Amer-Aussie, whose spot-on review you really must mark as 'helpful'), Bryson looks for the worst in America and, surprise, he finds it.  Sure, there's much that's funny here, but the humor gets swallowed up by the mean.  Let me add one more observation, which amazingly seems to have eluded all:  one of Bryson's worst habits--even worse than his penchant for telling you where he is politically (he hates Republicans)--is his smug disdain for and ridicule of religion, particularly Christianity.  Happily, Bryson's later books show a maturity absent in this one 
 I have had many problems with this book. Firstly, it takes 60-70 pages to actually get to the first tutorial. The author tells you all kinds of things that you don't need to know at that stage and just overloads you with information.  I have also had problems where the author says "just make it look like the one in the diagram" and the diagram is not clear at all. Sometimes it will be drawn in white ink on a light grey background (very difficult to see) and the author will refer to certain colours (obviously when he wrote it he could see the images in colour). I then have to guess at what the author means, only to find 5 or 6 pages later that he meant something else. I then have to go all the way back to fix it.  There is also an inconsistency in his writing. At times he will over-simplify things and at others, he will not give enough details. One such example was the second tutorial, where you assemble a train. Sometimes he would give the exact dimensions of certain parts and at other times he would not. You would not know that you got the length wrong until 4 or 5 pages later. It would seem that after giving us the basics, he expected us to be experts.  I gave up on the third tutorial, in which you build an axe. He vaguely said "move the CVs inwards" on the second curve but did not say on which axis to move them. I discovered a few pages later that I had moved them in on the wrong axis, so I had to go back and re-adjust them. It then gave me vague directions on detaching curves which did not work. I will now be buying a different book 
 Although I enjoy the stories in this book, and am interested in the subject matter, I find the book almost impossible to read.  Every sentence ends in an exclamation point-it is so manic!  manic! manic!  I haven't been able to finish it-I can only take it in small doses because while I read it it seems as though everyone is screaming and breathless (which, who knows, they may have been-after all it was on a ship in a storm).  Just a little hard to read, but very interesting 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 This item is billed as "The Best Of " Shatner and Nimoy..Now I really do have to wonder about the use of the word"Best"here...Neither Shatner nor Spock can sing,so this album exists as a goof...But there really isn't anything funny about the material contained on this disc...indeed,since at the time it was recorded both performers took themselves and thier efforts very seriously,the sides on this album were never intended as joke material..The fact that they HAVE become joke material still does not excuse the fact than any of these sides,by either of these two actors,were ever recorded...Now I like a good joke when I hear one,as well as the next guy,and I appreciate comic tunes,but the dull,tedious,often over-wrought balderdash that is to be found on this album stupefies rather than entertains... Getting back to the use of the word"Best" as a descrition of what is contained on this album...If this stuff is the"best" that either man is capable of I can only shudder at the thought of what the stuff left off this compilation must sound like..."Best"...as in The"best"manure the cow has to offer?..As in It's "Best" to shoot oneself in the head rather than endure these tunes?Or maybe "best" as in IT WOULD BE "BEST"TO AVOID WASTING YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY ON THIS FLAPDOODLE....That is a use of the word "best"that is appropriate.... 
 seems like this video could be useful, but the trainer is terrible at working the camera and makes you feel uncomfortable watching it, yet alone trying to work out to it....some of the moves were cool, but all in all i will trade this in for something else 
 Then snap this one up...otherwise, give it a pass for some of her old stuff.  Ms Williams, and her arrangers have pulled off a double feat: they've managed to downplay the range and occasional power of her voice while simultaneously delivering performances so discreet they sound like really good elevator music. It can't have been easy. (The soulless neutering of "Harvest for the World" made me shudder.)   Williams says she had a hard time recording such emotional tunes during the break-up of her marriage. If keeping her emotions under control was the goal, she succeeded brilliantly. Beautiful lyrics and poignant melodies are made meaningless by her absent singing - only her voice is there - the woman herself was more present in "Pocahontas."  I don't know whether to fault the artist or the producer for not taking the risk to push through to the core of these songs, but wish either of them been willing to risk being little more transparent and letting some of her feelings break through. If they had, she could have rivalled some of the original singers, especially "One Less Bell's " original artist, Marilyn McCoo, whose clear vocal quality she evokes.    Next time Vanessa, let a little of the fire you showed us in "Soul Food" out, it'll remind us that you're much more than a pretty girl who can hold a melody, you're a woman who knows joy and pain and isn't afraid to show it 
 I don't believe I've ever read such an unhelpful organizing book.  Much of the book is spent on describing the assumed state of the problem, rather than on offering solutions to the problem.  (Do I really need half a chapter to tell me that my kitchen is disorganized?  If I didn't already know that, why was I reading the kitchen chapter?)  The remainder of the "stuff" organization chapters (as opposed to the time management chapters in the first section of the book) consists of lists of tips.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of these tips are things that most of us could have figured out on our own.  "Write down what you're running out of BEFORE you run out of it." We don't necessarily all DO this, but I don't think we needed help coming up with the concept.  Moreover, most of the methods the author recommends will only work well for a small segment of the population - that is, those who don't actually struggle with disorganization but who have simply not gotten around to getting organized before.  For example, the method given for organizing a room is to dump EVERYTHING into the middle of the room, from all of the drawers, shelves, etc., and start from there.  For some people, this may work great.  For many of us, it would result in being immediately overwhelmed, crashing and burning when barely into the project, ending up with a much larger mess than what we started with, and, possibly, giving up on any further attempts to get organized.  Besides the lack of helpful instruction offered, I did not care for the author's tone/attitude.  The entire thing - especially the first section - made me feel as though I was constantly being beaten over the head.  The author continually railed against the "excuses" I was supposedly making for not getting organized and why I needed to just suck it up and do it.  Well, contrary to the author's perception, I had every intent of "sucking it up" and doing the job - that's why I bought the book and was reading it.  She also operates on the assumption that everyone has loads of disposable cash lying around and that everyone's lifestyle is - or should be - like hers.  ("When have you ever used more than one paper bag in a month?"  How about when we had the newspaper delivered every day and we used paper bags for holding the newspapers and taking them to the recycling point?  Does the author truly believe that NOBODY, ANYWHERE has a use for more than one paper bag per month?)  She recommends paying someone else to do nearly every imaginable task, and her not-so-creative solutions to most organizing problems are to just "buy such-and-such a gizmo."  If I HAD plenty of money to buy every organizing gizmo on the market, I WOULD NOT BE DISORGANIZED in the first place.    Finally, she routinely discourages respect for the other people in our lives.  If someone is late for dinner, she says don't heat up his dinner, because his own poor time management is not your problem.  So if my hard-working husband is late for dinner because a job took longer than anticipated I should leave him to fend for himself because it's technically "not my problem"?  I would skip this book, in favor of others whose authors are a little more knowledgeable AND gracious. 
 This item is going into the trash since it performs so poorly it is not worth price of replacement brushes and toothpaste cartridges (which it consumes voraciously).  Therefore, I decided to bite the bullet and throw it out - in actuality throwing out over $100.00.    However, I wanted to warn other unsuspecting consumers not to be mislead by the claims made by the manufacturer in its ads.  This produce DOES NOT get between the teeth - and it is definitely NOT close to flossing in it's effect (nowhere near it in fact).  Also, the toothpaste does not flow evenly - it either clumps up and turns into a gooey mess or comes out too fast and gets all over the toothbrush and counter.  When I E-mailed Sonicare, (incidentally you have to open an "Account" with them before they will even accept your E-Mail), I was told the time frame for a refund had passed and they were sorry I didn't like their product - Period!  When I wrote them back asking them to at least provide the name of a retailer in my area who carries replacement brushes - Wal-Mart stopped handling brushes for that particular model - so I would not have to pay shipping and handling costs on top of everything else, they did not even give me the courtesy of a reply.  Bottom line is my Dentist told me my teeth were in much worse shape after using this brush than before. I think that says it all 
    This was among the worst soundtracks ever played.  Horner scored the exact same music themes for Four Feathers,  Just as the movie was a con game, the music was recycled garbage 
 This book contains very general information on the basic steps and equipment required for a concert.  It is very basic and provides very little technical information 
 Professor Ellis is a very intelligent man, but he plays fast and loose with the facts, and sometimes he uses his gift for writing prose in ways that mislead the reader especially in, American Sphinx.  Ellis has obviously covered all of the ground with regard to what is known about Jefferson--but he doesn't objectively present all of the factual scholarship existing about our 3rd President.   If you want to know more of the detail of what was all involved with Sally Hemings, you MUST read Douglass Adair's essay "The Jefferson Scandals."  This essay is found in the book: Fame of the Founding Fathers: Essays by Douglass Adair.  Published by W.W. Norton.  Sally Hemings was the daughter of Jefferson's father-in-law; and Sally's lover was not T.J. but T.J.'s nephew (his sister's son).  That's why Jefferson never talked about the "scandal" because his close family relatives were involved; however, not the way Prof. Ellis says.  The unfortunate fact is that Prof. Ellis mentions Douglass Adair in American Sphinx, but he never mentions Adair's research (which Ellis cannot reasonably be ignorant of) on the alleged Sally Hemings-Thomas Jefferson liason.  It's obvious from American Sphinx that Ellis has read Adair's essays.  Prof. Ellis must know that the best evidence exonerates Thomas Jefferson, but he never tells us about that. The well publicized DNA test does NOT prove TJ was the father of any of Hemings' children.  TJ never fathered any children with Hemings and Ellis knows it. Prof. Ellis is intellectually dishonest on this point, and on many other points of Jefferson's life.  Too bad because he would otherwise have written a tour-de-force.  Instead it's a tour-de-FRAUD 
 This is a very terrible text book. Don't ever look at this book if you are a newbie in OpenGL, trigonometry, calculus, linear algebra and the mathematic's dot product. I think this book is suitable only for the University which the author is lecturing in. My university is using this book as the core text book of the computer graphic course, the end result is that almost 95% of the student cannot code well using OpenGL by following guidance of this book, where everyone is looking for coding and references from Internet just for the assignment, how annoy it is. Further, the lecturer also cannot understand the book's content, they lecture only by using the powerpoint slaid which is from the author himself, which make the situation worst.  If I am not mistaken, the author has claimed that the book is to help the student to program graphics as soon possible using OpenGL. It is absolutely not the true. This book will lead you to hell if you don't prepare yourself well in C/C++ and of course, OpenGL API. And if your lecturer does not know well in OpenGL API or C/C++ as mentioned, may God bless you. Another thing, if you look at the exercises of each chapter, I wonder if anyone who is beginner in computer graphics and by solely depend on the book can solve the problems.  Anyhow, I rate the book one star do not mean that this book is not a good book. To my opinion, this is absolutely a good book for those who have very strong computer graphic background together with mathematic skills or those who are advance learner in this field.   In fourth edition, I really hope that the author will come out something such as 'International Edition' of this book which the content may vary from the original version. This is because the computer science syllabus may vary from country to country. Bear in mind that the Top-down approach is suitable well in author's University or country does not mean that it is suitable to other University or country. This is what I mean the book is suitable only for the university or college that the author is lecturing in.  Remember, buy this book only if you already well-prepared yourself in C/C++, OpenGL API, trigonometry, linear algebra, geometry and some calculus basic 
 I purchased this book to augment Baby Bargains - what a waste. When the majority of the information is not in the handy ratings methodology their magazine uses - What's the point??  It appears that they cobbled together a list of products and put in the manufacturers' descriptions in paragraph form along with the statement that they didn't review items in this category.  I was deceived by the publisher - this was not a report by consumers or even their own people - this was just an advertisement for a bunch of baby products that was SOLD to me based on their "trusted" name.  The truly disgusting part is that I paid them for this and they probably made money on the back-end from the manufacturers by charging them to be included in the book.   Not only should you save your money, but you should question the impartiality of Consumer Reports 
 I read the story awhile ago and decided to get some CD's to listen to on my drive to work.  This is not an actual reading of the book, but more of a radio drama.  I have no problem with that, but the audio mixing is horrible.  The music is sometimes too loud and I could no understand the dialog.  The little boy does a terrible reading and has a very minor speech problem that makes him difficult to listen to.  I found it to be a very annoying CD to listen to 
 Arabs and Muslims do NOT hate America.  They are angry, indeed indignant, about U.S. policies in their region, and the ways the U.S. uses its power to dominate, invade, impose sanctions, support corrupt regimes, exploit oil resources.  These are, however, POLITICAL issues.  If they actually hated America, the situation would be hopeless.  But they love American values, freedom, democracy (look at polls in Arab countries) and most would like to immigrate and raise their children here.  This means that their own children will be Americans.  In the Middle East, Arabs/Muslims are very welcoming and helpful to American residents, who are not held accountable for the actions of their government (if this is a surprise, ask anyone who has lived in the Arab World).  This is contrary to the media image held by people who have not been there (violence, hatred).  Extremists, who hate the entire West, are perhaps one percent. Many people sympathize with resentments against America's political policies, but they do not agree with violence (many Americans sympathize with anti-abortion groups but do not condone blowing up clinics, and in the name of Christianity to boot).  Actual Islamic extremists are much like our White Aryans or neo-Nazis who oppose all who are not like them.  Here's a simple way to investigate this: ASK Arabs and Muslims in your community (they live in every community and blend in just fine) if they hate America.  Or if they are angry at America, ask why.  Commentators are always confident that they can explain how a group of people think (hatred of our religion, wealth, freedom, hatred going back centuries) or perhaps they need more information about us, or they're just crazy/evil/inscrutable.  Disputes between Islam and the West during the Crusader era, or the Islamic conquest era, etc., have no relevance in modern people's thinking (do the Crusades shape our thinking today?).  I am an American who knows Arabic and hears, and/or overhears discussions going on around me.  I travel widely in the Arab World.  I am just reporting on what I have heard first-hand.  Until our government realizes that the problem is political, we cannot begin to address responses to "anti-Americanism. 
 This book is way too outdated for our hectic, electronic, urban life. I don't recommend it, it doesn't take into consideration that we don't live in a farm and that our kids watch television and surf the web too. I have to say that I only read it briefly and decided it didn't apply to me 
 Not an easy read, kind of slow.  There is some good advice that we already know, but just don't utilize.  I still haven'r finished reading 
 One of my guilty pleasures is to review science fiction movies over and over again...Maybe I'm hoping the movie will get better with time. Unfortunately "Judge Dredd"  does not! I'm a science fiction fan that can be suckered by mediocre CGI , an action hero star, a comic relief, and a beautiful love interest but please don't mess with the storyline. Maybe thiis is the case for "Future Shock" and too much information was being given out but all in all science fiction deals with the person's humanity and  "Dredd" forces it down our throats too fast and too sugary....In fact , I feel two stars is gviing this movie too much! 
 I bought this book on the strength of the many reviews that praised it.  After reading it, however, I felt like I had just read a paid advertisement.  At first, the references to Sinatra held a certain fascination and made me feel like an "insider."  However, page after page of cloyingly sweet testimonials, written in a style that makes one feel that you are reading PR instead of candid comments, leaves a bad taste.  There are also repetitious references to the original Patsy, in his grey waiter's suit, refilling bread baskets.  Patsy sounded genuine, but I'm not so sure about his successors.  By the end of the book, all of this mushy testament, perhaps unfairly, detracted from the interest in the recipes.  I was left with the impression that this was a place that was treading on past glories and I decided to see what others had to say.  I looked at the customer reviews on the web for those who had recently dined at Patsy's and at least half of the reviews (from non-celebrities) reflected rude service from the front desk and serving staff and premium prices. There are some interesting recipes in this book but I just can't help thinking that Patsy's shot themselves in the foot with the way this book is written.  I like to read cookbooks, particularly those with a story to tell, but I couldn't wait to put this one down 
 There was some great lines and the ending was funny. Still, it was a movie spoofing about itself. It really wasn't all that good. Yes, plenty of celebrities. Still so what? 
 Todos los tpicos tienen algo de verdad, y aqul que dice que Borges es un escritor pedante para pedantes no es en absoluto una excepcin. Sus historias, a pesar de estar cuajadas en ocasiones de ideas interesantes, se ven total y completamente empaadas por el afn didctico y pomposo del autor a la hora de inundar sus escritos con referencias tanto reales como imaginarias a todo tipo de obras, autores, sucesos, etc, etc. Sus cuentos suelen adoptar ms bien la forma de un ensayo o de una disertacin filosfica que la de un relato convencional. Esto bien podra parecer algo original y audaz a simple vista, pero su ya mencionado didactismo, su escaso ritmo y la casi nula caracterizacin de sus personajes, restan muchsima fuerza a unas historias que, entre tanto aderezo culto y metaliterario, pierden todo aliciente a los ojos de cualquiera que haya disfrutado de narradores ms hbiles y conocedores del medio en el que se mueven.   Todava estoy tratando de dilucidar por qu diablos cosas como "Ficciones" o "El Aleph" estn consideradas como obras maestras cuando su inters no me parece que vaya ms all de lo puramente anecdtico. A todas luces el de Borges es un caso claro de egocentrismo o de vastas influencias literarias mal asimiladas.  Los aduladores borgianos, esa grimosa secta compuesta (generalmente) de elitistas literarios, seguramente dira, leyendo crticas como la ma, que la razn por la que Borges me desagrada es "porque no lo entiendo". Nada de lo que preocuparse, pues es bien sabido que para ellos toda aquella crtica negativa a su escritor de cabecera viene dada desde la frustracin de quien no logra aprehender al "seor del bastn". No falla, probad a poner en duda la grandeza del argentino, y ya veris cmo en pocos instantes os llueve encima un torrente de dicterios por parte de sus incondicionales poniendo en duda toda vuestra cultura general. En fin, que visto lo visto habr que borrar la palabra "pedante" del diccionario, total, como no hay libros malos, sino slo libros que no se entienden por los que los critican...  Jams he llegado a observar mayor grado de sectarismo que el que rodea a este autor por parte de muchos de sus admiradores (ni siquiera por los fans ms agresivos de autores "frikis" como Tolkien o Lovecraft), y en parte es por eso tambin por lo que no me gusta. He llegado a conocer gente que modifica sus gustos y preferencias literarias como borreguines para que casen exactamente con los de Borges. Y es que es tal el grado de arrobamiento comnmente requerido para la "correcta" apreciacin de este escritor, que de verdad a m me enferma. Sin duda a Borges se le puede considerar, independientemente de sus mritos literarios, un autntico soberano de insufribles.  No niego que Borges era un buen lector, que su amor por la literatura se deja traslucir de sobra en sus escritos, y que como crtico era bastante avispado, pero desde luego, en el plano literario, era totalmente incapaz de algo tan sencillo como contar una puetera historia sin exhibir gratuita y sistemticamente su supuesto grado de erudicin. En mi opinin, un narrador nefasto que obliga al lector a "adaptarse" continuamente y sin remisin a sus referentes culturales (como si stos fueran imprescindibles o necesariamente fascinantes). Presuntuoso, superfluo y, sobre todo, frustrante, pues promete lo que ni sabe ni puede dar.  He optado por escribir este comentario en castellano, idioma en el que Borges redacto sus obras, pero para el que curiosamente nunca tuvo nada bueno que decir hasta que recibi el premio "Cervantes". En fin que -aparte de su incompetencia literaria- fascinante desvergenza la suya (iba a decir "chaqueterismo" pero se me olvidaba que Borges es uno de los pocos con patente de corso para drselas de listo inventando neologismos, as que mejor ser callar, que igual no estoy capacitado, vete t a saber...)     Un clsico sobrevalorado ms (y van...). Puestos a tener que elegir algo que lleve el nombre de Borges, creo que me quedo con la famosa marca espaola de frutos secos. Me resulta ms digerible 
 Ross Thomas isn't exactly one of my favourite authors, but I liked some of his other books, so I didn't miss the occasion to read his Edgar-winning novel (his second, because he had won twenty years ago for "The Cold War Swap") and I have been very disappointed. It's as well written than usual, with brilliant metaphors and dialogue, but the plot seemed to me some confused. The characters speak almost only by epigraphs, and one never know what the story is about. I don't have in mind the other Edgar nominees for this year, but I'm sure there was many novels more deserving than this 
 I received a copy of Katie Melua's album and absolutely hate it. She's got a flat voice and her songs are so dragging. Even after repeat listening, I still find her bland. However, good on her for making alot of money for a voice and material as interesting as a glass of table water.  I gave my copy to the local charity shop, good riddance to bad rubbish, very bad.  I would prefer NO STAR but it dont exist, sigh 
 I purchased the set of two Park Smart parking mats as a simple alternative to hanging a tennis ball on a string which would hit the windshield when my car was sufficiently inside the garage to close the door. But even with stickum on the bottom the mats slipped on the smooth floor of the garage and the car hit the workbench time and again. I may say the service I got through amazon.com was first rate; it's the product I found wanting 
 We were forced to read this book in philosophy class some years back and everyone was appauled by her hatred of men and  inability of see the beauty and wonder of intercourse.Her view of women isn't much better in that they are supposedly the poor helpless vessels men prey upon to oh my have such a  distasteful act as intercourse.The male in her book is the  aggressor and the female is the passive unwilling but willing  victim to only get children and love in return.If she can't see the pleasure of the sex act then it's no one's fault but hers. Every page of the book was hard to read.I don't know why some people bother to read such books because it's a waste of  trees,paper and time! Another problem is she makes it sound as though women who  like intercourse aren't up to her intellectual level,as though she has some perfect world where women hate men and intercourse. She tries to make very subjective material sound like it's  supposed to be the objective norm for every woman.Not!!! Very dangerous book 
 Out of the twelve songs on this CD half of them are good.  The rest you can throw away.  THe good ones:  "I'll Be" (but this could have used a better arrangement), "Roses", "I'm Not Your Girl", "She Wasn't Good Enough for Him", "Back Before the War" and "We're All Alone".  The worst two songs on here are the title track "We're So Good Together" (my ears hurt from the guitar licks) and "Nobody Dies from a Broken Heart" (one of the ugliest songs I've ever heard in my life!!!  A good song will stand up with lyrics AND melody...not just lyrics!!!)  I'll give this release 2.5 stars because half of it is good and the other half isn't.  She could have released half a CD for half the price, couldn't she? 
 I bought the book because I liked the title but was very disappointed. The book has too many animals and baby blankets and few really  clothes for children. The title promises more. I have knitted one of the sweaters, but I am not inspired to knit anymore from this book. The layout could have been good if the drawings had been better. Gret 
 My wife bought this for our daughter for christmas several years back and frankly it is a terrible book. This coming from a huge fan of Dr. Seuss. It basically has no story or interesting plot at all. The purpose of the book is just to have a bunch of tongue twisters just to have them there. I really was surprised how bad this book was since I love so many other Dr. Seuss books (our child has at least 15 other seuss books we love). Honestly, my child picks this book periodically for bed time stories, and my wife and i will cringe when reading this. Also, our child doesn't really seem to care for it either. 
 If the church is our example of marriage Christ LOVED us first. He did not need to be respected first. I agree with the main idea of the book, however the author puts more pressure on women than on men. Men, lead the way in love as Christ did, even when he received no respect but crucifixion 
 I bought this game for my 11.5 year old daughter and she was not thrilled with it.  She played it once or twice and was bored with it.  It is not a good game if you want a toy your child will love 
 The checkbook cover itself is functional and works fine.  However, the odor from it could about knock you over.  I have yet to actually put it to use because it has been sitting on the shelf for three days, in the hopes that it will air out some (so far, to no avail.)  I am not kidding - it smells awful!  Whatever products they used to cure the leather left it smelling so indescribably terrible.  It isn't just a "leather" smell.  Trust me, I have leather shoes, coats, car seats, furniture, purses...I know what leather smells like, and this ain't it.  It is practically toxic.  The first day I opened it, my office smelled so bad that it gave me a headache.   I would advise you to look elsewhere 
 Too much text, not enough drawing. I much prefer Perspective: space and design  by Louise Bowen Ballinger 
 I can't use this on bracelets, it makes them too big and they slide off my wrist.  Also, the clasp is really heavy so if I use it on a necklace, it is always hanging in front, and it is not attractive.   Waste of money, I have never actually used it.  
 I was exposed to this book in what I think is the most unfortunate way possible, it was read to my child in her public school Kindergarten class. I was stunned and emotional when she came home and told me her teacher told her that a candy cane was a J for Jesus, and that the red stripes were his blood, and if she loved Jesus the white would wash it away. My child is five years old, and was disturbed by the whole thing.  This book has no part of the Christmas story in it, and the tasteless metaphor of it is impossible for a young child to understand.  The illustration is graphic and also not age appropriate.  The only good that has come from this absurd destruction of an innocent holiday treat is that now I am even more communicative and vigilant about my child's education and exposure, even in the school I trust with my child's life and well-being 
 This book is egregiously superfluous.  Sternhell, who has written good monographs on integral nationalism and the birth of fascism in Europe, suddenly finds that the Zionism which underpins his native land, Israel, is nationalist socialist -- hence a form of integral nationalism and perhaps proto-fascist if not actually fascist.  Is this a revelation?  Hardly.  It has been clear from the work some forty years ago by Carl Schorske that Zionism had the same roots as Viennese anti-semitism, that Zionism was the Jews' finally adoption of a nationalism that every other European people had already adopted.  It was defensive and a recognition that only Jewish nationalism could protest Jews from the nationalisms of their host peoples.  Herzl wanted to make Jews like everyone else:  a people with a land; and Zionism succeeded in giving the Jews a form of militant nationalism.  Sternhell has suddenly discovered that all other isms in Israel -- socialism, Marxism, liberalism, Judaism -- have been fronts for nationalism.  Well, where other peoples have had to invent integral nationalism -- a modern religion of nationalism -- the Jews actually invented integral nationalism in the Old Testament before anyone else.  What Europe contributed to this was 1) rejection of Jewish emancipation and 2) Rousseau, who invented the religion of the modern world, what Sternhell calls nationalist socialism but might as well call National Socialism (pace, Hitler) which is more or less the same thing.  Thus with his untimely revelations Sternhell feeds Arab and black paranoia about Zionism being racist, when all nationalisms are racist or ethno-centric.  This book serves no purpose 
 trust me, this book(let) is really bad. Nothing Nothing, it contains Nothing!   I guess some top bankers just write whatever off their minds during lunchtime and put into this book(let) for sale.   there is no way people would rank it 4-5 stars on a sane mind.   buy it and you will regret 
 I will remember this book forever as being the most boring peace of literature I have ever labored through. Most stories have some sort of introduction, a build-up to a plot and then the events of the plot play out in an entertaining way. I don't think Tolstoy got the memo.  The story goes on and on about the pointless, uninspiring lives of rich Russians at the turn of the century. None of these people interested me and I found no one to root for, they were self-centered blabbering idiots.   Lets start with Anna herself. All she did throughout the entire story was whine about this or that. I honestly don't see why she hated her husband so much, he seemed to be a good man. And the fact that she would abandon her son for some man really alienated me. The best part of the book  is the train scene when we were rid of her for good!  Count Vronsky was so clearly a slime ball, I do hope that Russian women of that era weren't so stupid as to fall for men like him.   Kitty, basically she was a blithering 12 year old brat, who was absolutely pointless to the story.   But alas, the most pointless person we all know was Levine. I read somewhere that Levine and Kitty were loosely based on Tolstoy and his wife. I wish that were more true, seeing as Tolstoy lead a much more interesting life, referring to the possibility that he had an affair with someone you wouldn't expect. If that story was is the book, it would have made Levine a lot more interesting. Sadly its not and  I will remember Levine as the most boring character in all of literature.  I couldn't even finish the last chapter.  I don't know why this is still held as such a great romance. There are so many better stories out there. People just buy into the notion of a "classic" and feel that they are expected to love it. There is no reason.  Pass on this book and find something with a story and characters you care about, an actual plot and a decent conclusion. 
 I've read only a few of Hillerman's previous Leaphorn/Chee novels. I've enjoyed what I've rtead, though they are an acquired taste, and I don't indulge in them very often. I tend to enjoy the earlier, more active years of Joe Leaphorn more interesting than his ' semi-retired unofficial advisor to Jim Chee' phase.   From what I gather, 'Skeleton Man' continues a recent trend of disappointment with Hillerman's last few novels. Even without having read the books immediately prior to this one, I can understand that sentiment. 'Skeleton Man' starts off with a rather risky premise, tying the story in with the real life collision over the Grand Canyon in 1956. While an author can occasionally pull off a good story with a strong connection to 'real life'(See Nelson De Mille's 'Night Fall'), Hillerman fails here. The story is bogged down with bland and unlikable supporting characters, flimsy motivation, and very little that could really be called 'action'. Chee ends up joining Leaphorn in the background for much of the story. The spiritual and ritualistic aspects of Hillerman's earlier books are, for the most part, glossed over here. Even what should have been a major plot development (Chee's wedding) is overshadowed by Chee have to rescue Manuelito, in the manner of far too many contrived 'Superman rescues Lois' situations.  Better to stick with Hillerman's earlier novels. The 'aging athlete past his prime' analogy suits Hillerman, I'm afraid 
 ...to dieting and to writing. As a previous reviewer alluded to, this book would have been much better had Dr. Atkins been able to finish himself. However, what we are left with is a co-author MD who's personality is as cold as ice; not to mention condescending and disrespectful.  This shines through in the tone of the writing. Furthermore, how can we take diet advice from someone who is obese herself? There are plenty of other well-written low-carb diet books.  Try another 
 Franklin Covey reps knew nothing about this product when I called them, because they do not offer it in e-book form.  It was never designed to be released in this format.  Amazon.com had a nice idea but they didn't think it through.  They need to 'Synergize' better.  Don't waste your time and money on this product.  
 All the 14 tools in this book are not new to me. The book, however, provides some insights on how to apply them to problem solving. In addition, the author devotes too much space on probability and weighting assignment to decision making (6 tools:Decision/Event Tree, Weighted Ranking,Probability Tree, Utility Tree, Utitlity Matrix, Advanced Utility Analysis). You don't miss much if you don't read it 
 Anna Qiuindlen wrote a very jeuvenile novel this time.  Her past books were worthy of praise but this is a silly story. I was very disappointed and need to remind myself not to buy a book from an author that I have previously enjoyed until I read reviews.  
 The title of this book should be an alert as how one could class the oratory work of Abraham Lincoln with Bill Clinton is beyond what a reasonable mind could accept. It is like having Albert Einstein and then including Daffy Duck. For that reason, I wonder of the agenda and the claim that the author knows more than anyone about these speeches and how he can pass over the oratory of the Comanche, Cheyenne and Kiowa at the Medicine Lodge treaty or for that matter neglect the moving speeches of General Patton only to include Betty Friedan who history has already passed over like most to the recent "great" speeches included here. There is just too much a mix of extraordinary with the mundane which appears like a political spin to try and make people like Bill Clinton appear great by sticking him in with Lincoln. How one can compare the destruction of a people in the words of Chief Joseph to what some of these speeches entail is pure rhetoric. One would do better to seek out the people who made the speeches in biographies and autobiographies than to invest in this rendered work, but if you enjoy rolling your eyes in how the compiler includes paid speech writers for leaders with people like Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Chief Joseph.....then you probably will enjoy this book. 1 star to alert readers to think before they buy 
 John R. Barry (another Digital Communications textbook author) first introduced me to this text.  And Mr. Barry, as with many com. theory persons I've met since (GTRI in Atlanta, GA; MITRE along around the Boston area of MA; Northrup in El Segundo, CA; Intersil in Palm Bay/Melbourne, FL) actually use this book to justify their values and beliefs.  Essentially, it's their Bible.  The only problem is that the values and beliefs in Proakis, especially from an engineering perspective, are very third rate.  Trying to use this text in a classroom situation, especially with a third rate engineer as an instructor, is an utter disaster from both an economic and an engineering perspective.  John R. Barry, for example, is a very good baby-sitter and a so-so mathematician (he couldn't be otherwise as a faculty member of Georgia Tech).  But as an engineer, John R. Barry, as with the other followers of Proakis, compares very unfavorably (in fact, I don't consider Barry an engineer; I consider him a phony that should be removed from the ECE faculty of GATECH; the department's economic fortunes would be far better if he were moved into some kind of adjunct English/Mathematics Faculty or just shipped off to some research laboratory without any students to harm [i.e., vampirically mind f--k them and then kindly provide them with werewolfic deliverance (yes, I mean along the lines of the 1972 movie with Jon Voight [Angelina Jolie's Dad] and Burt Reynolds)]...any place where truth/reality aren't so important).  There are far, far better communications engineers out there than John R. Barry [infinitely better to be precise].  And what makes these others better [others meaning real engineers; John R. Barry being a make-believe "engineer"] is not mathematical ability, memorized knowledge, or even rhetorical shrewdness, but rather the difference lies in a faith of facts; something a follower of Proakis never seems to possess or even grasp the possibility.    In fact, the values and beliefs in the Proakis text seem to promulgate not only  Intellectual Abuse, but also a Spiritual sort as well. In a nation (where Steven Pinker, who like Proakis is of Harvard Fame, has noted) that has around 75% of its population esentially believing in the biblical/torah-related account of things, this kind of Spiritual abuse can be very dangerous indeed and lead to serious consequences.  Though it may not be intentional, nevertheless, the values and beliefs of Proakis's text and those of its instructors tend to be extremely spiritually abusive.  These values and these beliefs somehow set up a massive cognative dissonance with many student's own biblical/torah-related values and beliefs.  The result is almost always a broken-spirit.  From an economic perspective, this is bad. Very bad. And it should be stopped by no longer using this text or any like it.  Most of the "engineers" now being "developed" by the followers of Proakis (e.g., John R. Barry) are very analogous to Mid 20th Century Carribean medical school "doctors."  They can say, write, and use a lot of terminology making them useful for billing purposes, i.e. writing up invoices to Insurance/Government agencies.  These "engineers" like those "doctors" don't and probably never will understand the essence of their professions, though because of their training or lack thereof they really think they do.  When in fact, they are utterly clueless "professionals. 
 somewhat disappointed, specially with a that catchy title: *developer's guide*.  Going from the coding material only, it would be extremely difficult for a newbie to start coding an app for the Mac OS X.  The 1993 book by Simson Garfinkel and Michael Mahoney, "NeXTSTEP programming: step one, object-oriented applications", is much more diligent in providing detailed guidance on just how to construct an app and use the tools for software development.  There were also some confusing remarks when comparing the three programming languages, Java, Objective-C, and C++.  And omissions too: for example, no mention that a protocol in Objective-C is like an interface in Java.  I didn't see a mention of the fact that there is garbage collection in java and there isn't in Objective-C (but I could be mistaken).  In my humble opinion, I would place Java and C++ closer together for their types, while Objective-C is closer to Smalltalk for being typeless.  A typed Objective-C, in which the identifiers are not of type id but of a class type such as NSString, or NSData, requires the compiler to do alot more work, just as in the case of C++ and Java (and the author does illustrate the disadvantages of these languages with the example of the Fragile Base Class), so there isn't much advantage in using the runtime features of the Objective-C runtime engine.  The author chose, in his examples, the typed form of Objective-C.  Most of the book is really a description of the product features of the toolkit to use when doing software development, but not to a detailed degree that one could do without printed manuals.  This is no substitute to the manuals.  No mention was made of connecting to data sources, internet development, distributed applications.  The first 50 pages are about why objects are great in storyline form.  But is was pleasant to read.  In the old days of nextstep programming, there was a beautifull little book that was called Nextstep programming tutorial by Ann something.  In that booklet, examples on how to build an application without the Interface Builder were given.  Just code in a text editor, write the make file, and then compile.  Only in later chapters did the author in that book detailed how the exact same application could be developed using the fancy tools.  With this approach, the developer gets a real feel for the development process itself, which are evenutally hidden by the tools.  That is the book that I was looking for when I saw the title of this book 
 Joe Carpenter lost his wife and two daughters when the plane they were traveling in crashed. A year later Joe is still grieving, he quit his job, sold his house and is thinking of suicide.  He visits the graves of his wife and daughters to find a woman taking pictures of the graves. He wants to know what she is doing, she says she was on the plane and survived. Men start shooting at her and then start following Joe. He wonders how anyone could have survived the crash.  Joe goes back to visit some of the people who lost love ones in the crash. The greiving family members are happy now that a woman named Rose has visited them. Joe can't figure why they would be so happy. Then the family members start commiting suicide.   Joe decides to go back to the place where is plane crashed since he has not been able to face it before now. He meets a family at a ranch near the crash site. They tell him a woman and small girl visited them the night of the crash and her name was Rose, and she had a small girl with her named Nina. The same name and description of Joe's youngest dead daughter. Could Rose and his daughter be the sole survivors of the crash?  Joe finally meets Rose and she tells him that his daughter is alive, then she tells him the story behind her surviving.  Enter the twilight zone!!!!    I thought that this was one of the worst books that I have ever read. I started to quit reading so many times, but I figured the story would get better. But instead of better with a ray of hope, it got weird, unbelievable, and down right dumb.  The story could have been so much better with a different ending. Most of the things Rose talked about were so out there you had to be a scientist to even comprehend them.  First the book was sad, depressing, hopeful, then weird.  This is the first book of Dean Koontz I have read, I know a lot of people like his books, but I will not read another one. 
 This book reads like a graduate thesis. It manages to bury interesting ideas with overly drawn out explanations and arguments. Each chapter should be pared down to a third of its length, but I recommend not finding out for yourself; spend your money elsewhere 
 Sorry, there is no way this shirt is supposed to last even your first five months...runs too small and was completely to thin/sheer.  Can be seen straight through 
 I bought this book because I was born and raised in the Alentejo and I was so anxious to read about familiar places and perhaps to better understand my own culture. I hate to say this but I read perhaps 20 pages, if that. Nothing made sense to me, and there was no flow.  I actually returned the book to the store. So sorry to say this but I would definitely not recommend it to anyone 
 This was the most god-awful boring Doctor Who story I've ever seen. And there were Daleks and Davros in it! No wonder the BBC took Dr. Who off their schedule for 18 months after this story. Colin Baker was never good at playing The Doctor, and almost killed the show for good. And that stupid costume he had makes The Doctor look more like an idiot than anything else. Oh and Alexei Sayle? Not funny! I didn't laugh once. They do find some time to mention that Americans have such bad taste, but after this garbage story I'm wondering who really has bad taste. The Doctor and Peri walk to Tranquil repose and it takes the entire 1st episode. They are attacked by one mutant in a pretty uninteresting fight sequence. The story turned into a confused mess of underdeveloped characters and ridiculous plot almost from the point the Doctor and Peri stepped out of the TARDIS. So save your money or buy Genesis or Resurrestion of the Daleks instead. 
 It apparently doesn't strike people as odd that Bush does not belong to a congregation and rarely goes to any church. Too busy? He spends more time on vacation than any President in history. Too disruptive? Carter not only attended a Washington Baptist church every Sunday, but taught Sunday school. Bush isn't alone; Reagan didn't attend church while President, either 
 A pamphlet would have accomplished what this guy said in the entire book!  I wanted to strangle him!  Repetitive, condescending, overly simplified and so BOOOoorrring!!!  Here is the nuts of it all:  Pick a stable stock with a narrow spread between bid and ask.  Buy 2000 shares and then sell it 1/16 higher right away.  Everything else is simply preamble... over and over and over.  Hope I saved you 20 bucks 
 This may be helpful to some ... it all depends on "where you are at" I suppose. But as for me, I found this book to be of no use. It's pretty much about honesty with self ... only lacking quality insight and depth. The so called content went in circles and was watery at best. I generally keep my books for future reference BUT I threw this one into the trash 
 I don't for a second believe that Burroughs is telling the truth about his life -- but I gobbled up his other books anyway.  He's funny and there's something endearing about the way he writes -- yes he's gay, and yes that necessarily "colors" his worldview -- but talking about a job you hate, a family you loathe, and a partner who amazingly tolerates you are necessarily universal.  That said, he lapses here.  This isn't as approachable a book and the narrator is isn't so much funny as he is unlikeable.  By turns smug and arrogant, too much of this feels self-indulgent.  Chafingly, distractingly so 
 First, I listened to the unabridged audio edition. Its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel. However, what I don't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees, weeping, invoking God and tearing their clothes. The count choc-u-lah voice of Anti-Christ was ludicrous and painful to hear. The endless discussions of hacking, and reading lengthy sermons from Judah, and listening to Chloe whine and Buck cry. I honestly can read no more. I thought I could finish out this series, but the Desecration was the worst book I've read in the series to date. Carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw.  What made this series great- the trials of an everyday Joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a Christian themed Ludlum novel with Buck and Rayford traveling the globe to rescue small-time Christians who get killed anyway, while ignoring their own families. Christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops. If Satan were as stupid as he's portrayed in this novel Eve would never have taken a bite from the apple.  Frankly, I finished this book, hoping Carpathia would whack Rayford and the rest of the tribulation force. They are so annoying and sanctimonious. 2 stars. 
 This program sucks. I used it last year and thought that it was unwieldy and really confusing (i.e. unlike TurboTax and other programs, there's very little transparency in the system). Then I bought it again this year because the store that I went to was out of Turbotax, and I needed to get my taxes done quickly. This year was even worse than last year - not only was it still unwieldy and irritating, but it gave me figures that simply did not make sense.  The results for the federal return were OK, but it gave me figures that would have cost me over $2,000 in taxes that I did NOT owe on my state return. I ended up going online to double check my results using a cheap ($10) online service recommended by the NY state tax website. Within 45 minutes, I cleared the online source, and got results that made far more sense. I have no idea what happened with TaxCut, but I suspect that they may have been missing a field somewhere along the line - this is a problem that has been noted by a number of others in reviews on a variety of sites. I will NOT be buying this product again 
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 I expected more from Wayne Wescott, Ph.D., who is often quoted by fitness magazines.  His name is well-known in the area of health and fitness research.  The book did not address sodium intake or give any recommendations for daily fat intake.  Caffeine was also not addressed.  It seems like these areas would be covered to some extent, given the book is about reducing cellulite.  The weight-training program did not advocate changing one's routine every 6 or 8 weeks to avoid plateaus.  I was excited to buy this book, but very disappointed at the lack of thoroughness on the part of the authors.  It just didn't seem to cover everything it should have, leaving this reader with many unanswered questions 
 I was given this book as a gift and found it completely and utterly useless. It's just a book full of words of little instruction. Nothing detailed or specific. No helpfull drawings or pictures.  A total disappointment 
 This is by all means the worst book on Nikola Tesla ever! This book portrays Tesla in a way that he never was, a confused lunatic with confused visions and a hard line nationalist attitude. It is no wonder that one reader nicknamed huh concluded that Tesla was stupid and was not able to finish most of his inventions (by the way, this guy sounds like someone from Edison's camp). Tesla was born in an environment of constant clashes between Croats and Serbs, and Ottoman empire (not "Asian barbarians" as this author constantly portrays this great Empire) had nothing to do with Tesla's departure to US. Teslas's father was orthodox priest (a hardliner) who wanted to see his son in the Serbian army (it is the same army who completely escaped into Greece which is unknown example of cowardice in the history and whose king also escaped to England leaving his nation to German mercy, thus Tesla did not see anything great in this "great army"). Tesla refused going to Serbian army and he refused being hard-line nationalist. Tesla once said:" I am proud of my country Croatia and my Serbian nationality". This indicates best that he was not hard-line nationalist (keep in mind that Serbian nationalist even today claim that Croatia is occupied Serbian territory and that it will be wiped off the map). This author actually invented many stories of Tesla's life and even more of them are from second or third hand, totally untrue.  On the technical aspect of this book it is not even worth any comments. Someone who does not know anything about electrical tech must be wondering, what the heck did this guy Tesla invent anyway (hence huh reader again)? I would describe the technical portion of this book as a good joke; even Mr. Bean would do it better. Author just could not sustain a certain hatred for Ottoman empire, which by the way was not much different then eg. Roman empire. Stay away from this book, you will not learn anything from it and could be infected with serious hate.   This book is a zero mark 
 "The term [Professional Learning Communities] has become so commonplace and has been used so ambiguously to describe virtually any loose coupling of individuals who share a common interest in education that it is in danger of losing all meaning."  Really? Thank goodness the authors of LEARNING BY DOING have returned with a fifth book (and CD!) on Professional Learning Communities to clarify things and distinguish their PLC from all those cheap imitators. Plus, it's important that teachers, the pawns currently tasked with implementing the PLC concept by fad-chasing school administrators all across the land, be set straight. Where would we be without these enlightened swamis to point the way? Not teaching, that's for sure!  So what exactly is a Professional Learning Community? In Chapter 1 of LEARNING BY DOING, our puissant authors spell out their definition of PLC in only four short pages, using plain, simple language that is refreshingly free of educratic clichés. Lest we all die of suspense, let's review what the Holy Scripture Saith. PLC's are defined by:  "A Focus on Learning": Because schools have never focused on that before, have they?  "A Collaborative Culture with a Focus on Learning For All": Interdependence, collaboration, and collectivism are key to PLC. Anyone caught thinking for themselves, or by themselves, will be ritually sacrificed in the next round of campus budget-cuts.  "Collective Inquiry into Best Practice and Current Reality" [NB: This statement and the passage that follow it are not translatable into any written or spoken language that I'm aware of, including English. I thought I was a professional teacher, but because I don't understand a word the authors said on this page, according to them I'm not a professional at all. If anyone can tell me what it means, please e-mail or fax me. I wait with bated breath; apparently my job depends on it.]  "Action Orientation: Learning by Doing" [Ditto this statement. Although, speaking of breath, doesn't the act of breathing signify an "action orientation"?]  "Results Orientation" [Now that I've caught my breath, the only tangible result of PLC that I can discern is that any teacher who refuses to play ball with the PLC cultists should plan on early retirement or a change of career.]  I could go on, but why bother? Until teachers themselves start standing up and asserting intellectual authority over their profession, the educrats and charlatans behind PLC will have us chasing our own tails until the end of time, or until they find another gimmick to fiddle with. And all at the expense of our students, who deserve far better.  
 In truth, this book is an example of how a massive publicity (reviews, articles, people speaking about it) is able, by itself, to promote an absolutely worthless book to one of the "best-sellers". This book seems one of those amusing manuals that are usually titled "How to improve your self esteem", "Become a winning seller"... I bought "Rapid chess improvements" due to the impressive amount of citations you can find in (sadly) specialized chess sites.  This book, basically, does not contain anything. A 24 pages long introduction offering nothing. Chapter 1, 15 pages on chess vision drills: simple exercises (move the knight, move this, move that) that you can read for free on many chess websites. Chapter 2, 18 pages. The seven circles. It is basically a promo for a non-freeware software on tactics. Chapter 3 is a commented game. Chapter 4 is a collectin of exercices. I did not read chapter 5 BECAUSE it contains "success stories" about how good some students of his became. Chapter 6 what you should do to improve (like, honestly, forgetting about this book and buying another one).  I received this book yesterday and I read chapter 1--4 in few hours. It was very fast, wasn't it?  This is absolutely the most useless book I have ever bought (among chess and non-chess related books).  I used to think that a player could buy books edited by Everyman chess being certain of finding a good content. After yesterday I had to change idea 
 The subject of the book is interesting but the writing style is vague and very circumstantial. What can be said in one sentence is explained in one or several paragraphs and what can be explained in one paragraph is said in a chapter or more. You don't want to put some books down once you piced them up. This book is the opposite; you cannot wait to put it down. It is very boring to read.  
 this has got to be the WORST film I've ever seen. its not sad. Its not funny, jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage. I don't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie, because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him. the actor is the worst of all. i cant tell if he's sad in some seens, or angry or jest retarded. I've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks, I guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present. it probably worked better back in 96'. but this movie is SO SO SO BAD. its embarrassing. do not rent it or buy it or view it on television. NOTE'S: THIS FILM HAD  SOME GREAT TALENT A song from Olivia Newton Jon, and (one of my most personal favorites) Mila AND my favorite comedians Margaret Cho. She's to good but...why this film, she (and Mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this.      
 Although the book may contain some very good information, the poor editing makes it hard for me to read. As a magazine editor, I probably notice these problems more than others, but I find them very distracting. I may change my rating once I've made it through the entire book, but as it is, I'm having trouble reading more than 2-3 pages at a time without putting the book down in annoyance 
 I am a long time fan of Eco's non-fiction. The pieces were not billed as being related and they certainly aren't. They should have merely lived their short lives as speeches and newspaper articles and not been bound. For the Eco collector, go to original texts, not these translations 
 Think about Christianity.  About Catholicism, and about Protestantism.  Think about it entirely dispassionately.  Think about it removed from its major role in shaping Western society.  Think about it removed from all the Christians you know, or whether you yourself are a Christian.  Hopefully, at this point, you will realize that there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to subscribe to it.  Christianity, in its purest essence, is submitting yourself to a mythical authority that you will never see, hear, touch, or truly know.  It is the intellectual laziness of assigning all that you cannot explain about the world as the creation of an entirely unexplainable being - in other words, refusing to admit the general ignorance of yourself and, indeed, the human race as a whole by claiming that the only reason you can't explain something is because it is inexplicable, thus saving yourself the frightening strain of having to actually make an effort to think about anything.  And, if God is indeed as arbitrary in his predestination as Luther and Calvin claimed, why follow him?  (Claims about 'The Elect' are not an answer; in saying that God predestined only certain people to enter heaven, but in acting morally you show yourself a likely member of that group, Calvin merely gives the Catholic doctrine of "good works" a new name.)  As polemicized as the above may sound, it does have a purpose in the context of a discussion of this book.  Luther, in trumpeting more ascetic, predestination-oriented Christianity over the rich, material hypocrisy of the established Catholic Church, was merely  replacing a material, class-based slavery with a moral slavery.  In claiming that Desiderus Erasmus' promotion of free will is merely an invitation to sin, Luther shows his true colors.  He demonizes choice and diversion from "the true way" in order to convince others to follow him and add to his power.  Funny, he wasn't quite so opposed to free will when he himself chose to defy the established Catholic order.  It is not wrong to enjoy alcohol, sex, or material possessions.  It is wrong to have these things while also preaching against them, as the Catholics did, but it is not wrong to enjoy the material pleasures of the world.  In Luther's steadfast opposition to other people enjoying themselves, and advocacy of instead living your life according to a supposedly otherworldly moral authority which conveniently seems to have been revealed only to those who gain power, we have merely the cynical and, yes, thoroughly materialistic manipulations of a man too bitter to acknowledge others any kind of pleasure, independent thought, or deviation from Luther's arbitrary set of standards.  The Catholics cynically exploited the masses by selling indulgences and fake relics through promises of a nonexistent paradise (see:  The Pardoner's Tale in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales).  The Protestants cynically exploited the masses by demonizing anything that might distract those masses' attention for one second from doing exactly what the Protestant leadership said (see: John Calvin's nightmarishly despotic Geneva).  Neither was any better than the other, and both attempted to squash dissent mercilessly.  Luther's book is just another one of these attempts 
 DO NOT buy this book if you are beyond beginner's level. Reading the reviews I thought I was getting something to show me how to render better texture - forget it! To be fair, this would be ideal for a beginner, but not anyone over that level - essentially, it is only showing how to use a brush - i.e. how to load and make a stroke. Waiting for it on the other side of the world, it was a bitter disappointment indeed 
 This is a moderately well-spun book about the "No Spin Zone." Should be called the "Know Spin Zone" since really nothing in it is objective.  O'Reilly is a case-study in the typesubjective journalism that is prevalent in the media these days and the book shows this.  In other words it's a must read for everyone with the ability to see through it.  If you can't see through O'Reilly's bias then this book is poison 
 I thought it was pretty bad. Hostel was better than this crap. I mean it was ok in some parts but I didn't expect much. It's not even scary. I can't wait to watch Hostel 2 when it comes out 
 Starting a series in the middle is always tough, but I'm a firm believer that readers should be able to enter the path at any point and feel welcomed. Johansen does a good job of giving enough of the backstory on her characters (forensic scluptor Eve Duncan, her adopted daughter Jane, and her live-in love Joe Quinn) that I understood what was going on.  She also set up an interesting plot line -- a body-less skull, a mysterious letter in the mail, a betrayal by Joe -- that I was pulled in immediately.  Unfortunately, that's where the good parts end. Eve is a narcissist who seems to act with little regard to her family, the other characters seem to exist solely to serve her will (doesn't Joe have any passions or needs of his own?), and the plot was splotchy and haphazard. Twists and turns appeared without any apparent foresight by the author other than, "Wow, this will fool 'em!" I was left with more questions than were answered. Not a good end to a mystery. 
 Regardless of whether you agree with Hendershott's views, you must admit that there isn't any actual sociology in Hendershott's book. There is virtually no reference to social science research, except to criticize studies without any reason except that she doesn't like the results. Instead, Hendershott provides anecdotal evidence from nonscientific sources as if it is generalizable.   There are two testable hypotheses in Hendershott's book. First, that definitions of deviance have changed greatly over time. Second, that this shift in definitions has affected people's behavior in negative ways. Both of these are easily testable hypotheses, but she unfortunately doesn't test either of them, and just provides examples that support her arguments. This is what sociologists call relying on an "N of 1." She should have learned that as an undergrad.   I hope this review helps you avoid the massive time-waste that reading this book would be. Instead, I'd suggest reading Joel Best's "More Damned Lies and Statistics," which points out very well how dangerous it is to rely on examples and case studies as if they represent large-scale social patterns. 
 The movie is fine.  The problem is the DVD.  Poor color, sound and the images are not clear.  It is though someone taped this show with their home video camera.  Wish I had not bought this DV 
 The timing for this book couldn't be better - an era of skyrocketing deficits, an aging population (boosting pension outlays), inexorable increases in healthcare costs (fewer workers with health insurance, aging population), and businesses increasingly threatening to move elsewhere unless they receive tax relief.   Simply cutting budgets accomplishes little - as Osborne points out, it does nothing to improve areas retained. In addition, service recipients or proponents (usually providers) simply complain ad naseum until an opportunity to restore funding occurs (eg. tax increase or economic upturn) presents itself - thus setting the stage for the next crisis.   Osborne is also correct in pointing out that the most common budget "cures" are simply illusions - accounting gimmicks (timing "games" regarding outlays and receipts, fudging estimates, temporarily ignoring voter mandates), borrowing, and delaying maintenance.   At this point, however, Osborne goes off the track by proposing some intelligent-sounding changes in approach (eg. identify the results wanted), and proceeds to go through a lot of razzle-dazzle that simply ends up with "business as usual."   Using Washington state as an example, Osborne cites how a citizens group decided to focus on providing more early-childhood-education and implementing skill-based pay for teachers - neither a "REAL" result. During the last 30+ years innumerable education "improvement" programs have been funded, while progress has been non-existent - eg. scores by 17-year-olds on the National Assessment of Education Progress (the only unchanged large-scale test in the nation) have remained unchanged, as have drop-out rates. This, despite a more than doubling of inflation-adjusted per-pupil spending in the last 30 or so years. As for "skill-based" teacher pay, study after study has found that - after taking into account pupil differences - payment for EXISTING "skill-set" programs (teacher experience or degree levels) contribute little (only the first few years of experience) or nothing to pupil achievement. So why add another dubious dimension? If one needs any more evidence, consider the fact that most private schools only cost about half that of public schools.   Universities are another major State-level expenditure; like K-12 education, MAJOR overhaul (not rethinking budgets)is required. Since the early 1990's, professors' teaching workloads have been reduced from three classes per semester to two. Nationally, and undoubtedly in Washington also, the length of the academic year shrunk from 191 days in 1964 to only 156 in 1993. Meanwhile, only 21 cents of every funding dollar goes into the classroom - the number of non-teaching professionals (eg. counselors) has increased from 3 per instructor in 1976 to 6 in 2001. Returning to those recent productivity levels, substantially reducing admissions of the roughly half unable or unmotivated to graduate, and shortening the average 5+ years required to graduate would allow savings of about $500+ million/year in Arizona and it is assumed that similar opportunities exist in Washington.   As for healthcare, Osborne's Washington process suggested dropping coverage for low-income workers - an ACCOUNTING GIMMICK that simply transfers the costs to providers, and adding more clinics. However, what is really required is a review of incentives and other care drivers - eg. the highest-spending areas in the U.S. spend about 60% more on Medicare recipients than the lowest, despite access to care and patient outcomes being better in the low-income areas. A second problem is that healthcare providers are REWARDED for their errors - payors need to insist on adherence to quality standards. A third major problem is that care recipients have no incentives to conserve - Health Savings Accounts (allowing cashing out of any funds remaining from a set amount) do so.   Clearly Osborne's work would be more useful if it focused on outcomes - both good and bad. Associated with that should also be a discussion of benchmarking (staffing levels, compensation for staff, and benefit levels), and continuous improvement goal-setting that emphasize reducing waste and improving quality "Toyota-style" - keys to success in the private sector.   The "bottom-line" is that the focus should not be on the budget process, but on permanent reform of the biggest consumers of government funds - education and healthcare. 
 Given this book was about presentation and promotion I was suprised to find the reproduction very poor, as if it was a photocopy in some parts.  The paper selection was poor and some of the photographs of works approaching unreadable.  The advice and text was good.  Very, very diasappointed and in fact gave the book away 
 My family thinks that this is the best toilet paper available.  
 I ordered a waterproof windbreaker, they sent a zip front hooded sweat shirt. I needed the item for a trip where I anticipated a lot of rain and I didn't have time to reorder. I returned the wrong item and went with what I had which wasn't the right thing either but, it was better than what they sent. I'm not happy 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 I bought mine at Wal-Mart for $20, followed the instructions with two scratched DVD's from the library (one badly scratched, the other still playable) - and saw almost no change in the scratches or playability.  It's going back in the morning.  This model relies on an aluminum oxide paste (superfine liquid sandpaper) to sand off the scratches.  I think I'll see better performance from one of the products that actually fills in the scratches rather than sanding down the rest of the disc.    For cleaning, just get one of the inexpensive manual cleaners with the little bottle of denatured alcohol - they work just fine 
 Hey, BRRRRRUUUUUCCCE!  What's the deal? Just about every major Top 40 artist has had their catalogs sonically updated EXCEPT YOURS.  Why can we buy the "Tracks" editions, and get glorious HDCD-encoded sound, but "Town" sounds like it's coming out an AM radio?  OK, you did your best, but Dubya's back in the White House for the next four years, and Kerry's home in his underwear watching the Weather Channel. You should have plenty of time on your hands now... GET BUSY!  Let's see some remastering! 
 When I took this class I was utterly confused by most of the material and some of the problems made no sense whatsoever, neither the set up nor the solution. When I TA'ed the class, luckily the professor worked mainly out of a course erader made of his own notes. The bad part was he picked problems out of this book for homework. Many of the solutions are quite simple, WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM CORRECTLY, a task this book left completely up to me to explain to the students. Also, a few solutions were just plain wrong or required huge simplifications and assumptions that were not intuitive.  If you have to buy this book, buy the cheapest copy out there or just photocopy the few pages you'll need.  Also, where the h*ll do they get the nerve to charge so much for such a short useless book. It's a fifth edition that doesn't show much care or thought put into it.  This book is typical of what's wrong in the textbook publishing industry, we students are overcharged for garbage and required to buy the newest edition of content that hasn't changed in a hundred years. It's almost as if we're paying professors for plagiarizing classical theory! I strongly recommend going elsewhere to LEARN the concepts of mechanical vibrations. 
 First of all I want everyone to notice that this is only VOLUME 2.  Volume one is no longer available anywhere.  Thus, making this book fairly useless.  The only thing that it's really good at it showing different stiles between professional comic book inkers.  It nice to page through and I don't regret buyin it but it is not necessary for an artist's library 
 This book is such a drag- not for the math bit, but the non-mathematical sections. The stories and ramblings are absolutely unnecessary, and detract from the substance. The problem is that the stories are inextricably intertwined with the math, and quite impossible to skip if you don't want to  miss the math bit. To the extent I was able to drag on, the calculus portions seemed great, but it became too tiresome going through the flab. The great book on calculus has to be "How to enjoy Calculus" by Eli S. Pine- a book I regret not having known in my school days 
 I read another book by this author, Friendship Cake, which I really enjoyed and passed around to several friends. So I picked this one up thinking it would be worth a read. Luckily, it only took me about an hour and a half to read it, since that's about as long as I'll remember it.  I guess I never really cared about the characters too much. It's not a thick enough book that there's a lot of room for exploring and exposing the characters, which is too bad, because they could be interesting. And I know Hinton's capable of it from her last book. I also read that the author thinks race relations is so important to this story ... I never got the whole emphasis on race relations thing. The story happens to characters who happen to be interracial friends/lovers, but I never get that it's important to the plot.  Not to mention that the "big secret" is telegraphed so blatantly it's hard not to know what it is almost immediately.   In spite of its faults, I think it would be OK for a quick beach read or if you just don't care for much depth at the moment 
 Small makes a few valid points, but he seems too closed-minded.  He critizes Western music too much and sometimes his arguments are just plain stupid 
 I really enjoyed The Perfect Storm.  So, I gave Ms. Greenlaw the benefit of the doubt and started her book.  I was less than impressed.  I lasted till page 53 where I just ran out of patience with her plodding technique and her lack of story. This is a bad book attempting to ride on the tail of Junger's book.  Sebastian Junger's blurb on the cover was "Anyone who loves the sea will love this book"  I think not 
 If you're a deer hunter who actually enjoys watching late night infomercials, have I got a book for you! John Weiss' "The Advanced Deer Hunter's Bible" is 190 pages of commercial endorsements thinly  disguised as a book about deer hunting. Weiss doesn't even camoflage the  advertisements with the old "I used Dr. Zook's Buck Dee-See-Ver and  shot the biggest buck of my life!" Instead he "proves" the  value of the products by quoting "experts" who just happen to  work for the company that makes the stuff. There may be valuable  information in there somewhere, but I was too disgusted to find it after  wading through ten separate Name-Brand endorsements in the first eleven  pages of text. My advice is to save your $10.36 plus shipping and handling  or spend it on three issues of "Outdoor Life". That way, the  advertisements are labeled and if you don't learn anything useful you can  still read Pat  McManus. I give this book one star only because zero isn't  an option 
 I haven't read any of the real Robert Ludlum before, but I don't think I will be starting if this is his style. The action scenes, with their falling chandeliers and mexican shootouts, are perhaps better suited to a 90 minute movie instead of a 400 page book. The weapons-catalogue padding is comical at first, later frustrating. The childishly cliched language is little help in distinguishing the myriad of characters and places. We know only the color of their hair before they are mercifully laid to rest. Perhaps most disturbing is the book's overall 1950's style racism  in which the Americans are dashing, multi-skilled warriors for good and the Russians, Ukrainians, even Germans are all ugly, inhuman or quickly dead. Whilst the premise for the story is promising and the plot is simple but water-tight, the reader is always a step-ahead of the characters. As other reviews have said, suspense and mystery are left absent 
 This is something I would find on a humor website. And it's not very good. Most of the jobs listed is only held by a few people and not what I call real jobs. There is a show on The Discovery Channel that is titled "Dirty Jobs". One job that Racz mentions was featured on it. Chicken sexer. And what the job is about is quickly finding out what sex the baby chicks are. But he mentions silly stuff mostly like Saddam Hussein Double and Exorcist. A few real ones like Data Entry and Shopping Cart Valet.   I got this book from the library by placing it on hold. If I saw the inside of this book I wouldn't have bothered with it.  
 I found the characters to be mostly caricatures; there's no sense that any of them are actual human beings. As a result, there's no change -they're static, and whatever changes they supposedly go through feel completely unbelievable. And while much of the book focuses on how different classes don't truly see each other, Forster commits that same sin himself by ignoring the poorest family in the book, the Basts. Instead of making them seem real, he reduces them to mere plot devices.  In addition, Forster, a product of his time, is given to making sweeping pronouncements about the human race. Again, if he intended some irony here (as, for example, Jane Austen, who was so good at shading her prose with those kinds of hints), I'd think better of this book. Novels typically rely on either a solid plot (i.e., the stuff that's happening) or on solid characters (i.e., the stuff that happens in people's inner lives) or both to carry the reader through. I found neither here. At the very least I would like to feel the author's genuine love of language; I can forgive a bad book if it's exceptionally written. I didn't find that kind of prose here. You can skip a good third of the pages and lose nothing 
 In need of a fun, adventure read, I picked up an author I always seem to see on the shelves - Cussler. It was a fun, easy read, but I expected better from such a prolific author. This is a book I would have loved when I was 14 years old, but have now come to a be a bit more demanding of realism. I found the syntax and grammar of the narrator to be very poor, which detracted from the book tremendously - I was left wondering if the editor just rubber-stamped this one.  My main issue with this book was the sci-fi level of belief suspension needed to get through it *Spoilers*: 1) fully functioning artificial intelligence robots able to carry out casual conversations, circa 1993  2) Japan has secretly created a perfect missile defense program  3) an adventurer/underwater researcher sent in to take down a heavily defended fortress, instead of a trained team of SEALs/Delta/etc. 4) That a Japanese tycoon created over 100 nukes from one salvaged "Fat Man" atomic bomb from 1945.  5) That a super-secure vault would have a convenient ventillation duct large enough for a man to squeeze through.  6) Robots that drive cars 7) several ridiculously convenient coincidences that save the day  8) the usual near death witty comment, etc...  all in all, kind of fun, but don't think much or you'll ruin the plot. 
 I was very disappointed in the quality of this DVD.  I would not recommend anyone buying this DVD until the quality is back to that of a professional recording 
 The first sentence in the book is "People who aren't autistic always ask me about the moment I realized I could understand the way animals think."  It should have been "People who aren't autistic always ask me about the moment I SOMEHOW GOT THE NOTON THAT I could understand the way animals think." There's no proof in this book, no good evidence, just Ms. Grandin's anecdotes and speculations.   Noticing a lot of detail because you have autism and being able to use this ability to design humane slaughterhouses does not translate into thinking like animals think.  The book does offer many clear, simple descriptions of scientists' research. So if you don't know anything about animal research, these descriptions could be a good place to start. 
 I think the mobile is very cute, but there is no way it will fit onto my crib properly. I tried attaching it in several differnt places. I am going to return it. 
 I really wanted to like this book. I was excited to start reading it because it looked really interesting. I was very disappointed. The story felt very one dimensional. None of the characters to me seemed to have any depth. I never felt I knew any reason why the characters acted one way or another. The plot was absolutely predictable, there were gaps, and the narrative seemed to jump around all the time. In all honestly I got to frustrated a little over half way in and skipped ahead to the end. The end was exactly what I expected. I very rarely skip ahead in a book, I will struggle through bad book in hopes it will get better, but this one was just not good enough for that. Anyways if someone is looking for a good read this is not the book to find it in.       
 This was the 2nd DVD with problems that I bought from this vendor.  The first DVD had 2 sections where the DVD would pause but would continue playing, and I was willing to live with it.  Bootcamp/Muscle Endurance, on the other hand, would not play the Muscle Endurance workout at all!  I contacted the vendor and they said it was a problem with my DVD player and they would only allow me to exchange with any of their 'OPEN' dvds only to 'better suite my needs'.  I own 20+ workout DVDs and none of them gave me any problems like this one did.  The DVD is also fairly pricey and so I'm afraid to buy any more of these dvds from them.  I was able to play the Bootcamp workout until towards the end (before the cool down section) where it would not continue playing.  I like Cathe's workout very much.  The part of Bootcamp that I was able to play was excellent! But I am very disappointed with this vendor 
 This edition of "James Bond: The Secret World of 007" is rather superfluous. The produces of CASINO ROYALE have indicated that this film is going to be a new beginning for James Bond. If so, the 20 James Bond films in the series that preceded CASINO ROYALE really have no continuity in relation to this film. Therefore an edition dedicated solely to this film would have been more appropriate. Just end it with the sections in addendum to DIE ANOTHER DAY. The James Bond based in the Twentieth Century had a good run 
 Michael Jackson is one of the most gifted songwriters/singers of our time. You can discuss his person, you can discuss his behaviour, and all the other stuff, but you can't really take that away from him. And that's exactly why this album is so unacceptable, coming from someone like him - when you've reached superstardom and gone beyond it, you don't release a record that's so horribly mixed up and full of second grade tracks that it's bound to be a faliure. At least, you should expect to hear for it. And hear for it he did, cause the critics didn't go lightly on this one. And it's not that bad, actually. I mean, that's what I have my program function in my CD-player for, and my CD-burner.  The album starts on a fair streak - Unbreakable, Heartbreaker and Invincible - are all fair tracks - below average for MJ, sounds like a watered down selection of discarded tracks from Dangerous that were then discarded for HIStory and then discarded for Blood On The Dance Floor, and full of badly placed guest rappers to top it off - but apart from that, if you forget who made this music, these are actually good, funky dance tracks. For Michael Jackson they're passable, but nothing more. *SKIP*  On to track 8 - Speechless - arguably the strongest moment on the record. One of only two tracks that Jackson actually penned himself, and it shows. The amount of emotion in his voice will knock you prone, and actually proves very well what the rest of the album lacks: Joy for the music, and personal emotion. The lyrics are like a poem, and one of the most beautiful love declarations in all their simplicity. Top grade to Jackson for this one track, and if you are into his music, buy the CD cheeply just to get this track.  Track 9 - 2000 Watts - is another of the stronger moments of the record. This one is simply plain fun, and that's another important lesson Jackson should have lurned - to let go of the reigns, and stop caring whether it's hip or street or down with the trend - because it isn't - but this is darn good pop music, and nigh irresistable. *SKIP*  On to track 13 - Cry - penned by R. Kelley. The same R. Kelley who is guilty of writing one of the most horrible songs of all times (I Believe I Can Fly, if you had doubts), but it seems that with Jackson, he can do no wrong. He wrote the endearing You Are Not Alone - major hit in Europe - and this track is possibly even better. Oh, forget about the sappy lyrics, and just enjoy the wonderfull music. This is pop writing in top class, and if Jackson sounds like he takes the Marthyr role a bit too seriously, it's still one of the best tracks on the record.  Track 14 - The Lost Children - is the other song penned by Michael alone, and it's not a bad effort - had it not been for the children choir and sleezy intro, you could probably have ignored the lyrics and enjoyed a nice pop tune. As it is, it falls somewhat flat, and becomes completely choking in the end - but yes, it's a nice tune. Thumps up, mr. Jackson.  Track 15 - Whatever Happens. Ok, that's one weird track. Michael Jackson featuring Santane. Wtf? Well, kudos for doing this, and it actually works, in a sort of absurd way. Not single potential, and not a classic, but it's not embarassing, and as an album filler, it's completely acceptable as a cureosity.   Well, what about the rest of it then? Lead single You Rock My World was never my favorite - the spoken intro is downright embarassing - but the track is not bad. I can accept that on the record. The same is not true for the horrible ballads Break Of Dawn, Heaven Can Wait, Butterflies, You Are My Life and Don't Walk Away. One is worse than the next, and every time I just try to listen to them, I start chocking to the degree of loosing my last meal. Yes, it's that bad, no really, it's horrible. I. Can't. Stand. These. Songs. Period. There are simply no redeeming qualities for me.  And then the two monstrosities - Privacy and Threatened - that just sound like a very - very - bad joke on the man himself. Tabloid Junkie from HIStory actually worked, because it packed a great punch, and well, had not been heart before. Well it had been, it was pretty much the same as Why You Wanna Trip On Me from Dangerous, but still. It worked. Ghosts was a good track of Blood On The Dance Floor. Forget about the movie that was - well, embarassing. But the music was good. These tracks aren't. They sound dated, repetitive, out of place and utterly boring and uninspired. Get over it Jackson, we don't want to hear more about the media nagging you, it's not going to make them go away.   Well, all in all, what do we have ... To take the album from A to Z:  Unbreakable - 6/10 - A fair dance track. Heartbreaker - 6/10 - same. Invincible - 6/10 - same. Break Of Dawn - 0/10 - Horrible R'n'B overproduced. Vomit. Heaven Can Wait - 0/10 - same. You Rock My World - 5/10 - well, at least it sounds new. Butterflies - 0/10 - more vomit. Speechless - 10/10 - the flower in the dirt. One true MJ song. 2000 Watts - 8/10 - Very enjoyable, and stands out tall compared to the rest. You Are My Life - 0/10 - even more vomit. Privacy - 2/10 - Yawn. Repetitive and dated. Don't Walk Away - 0/10 - end of vomit. Cry - 9/10 - beautiful showmanship, Kelly + Jackson works - again. The Lost Children - 6/10 - well, it has potential. Whatever Happens - 7/10 - interesting, and well, refreshing, if somewhat strange. Threatened - 2/10 - same as Privacy, and exactly as boring.  This yields and average about 3.6/10, or 2/5 stars, which actually matches my fealings for this album fairly well. Yes, I'm harsh, but from a man as gifted as Jackson, you just expect more. Quality control next time, please, mr. Jackson.  On the bottom line: Outtakes The Way You Love Me and We've Had Enough showed up on the 2004 Ultimate collection and outranked 2/3 of this album by far. Go figure 
 Product description describes a tub of 108. The actual item is only 36 pieces. Not very happy about only getting 36 when the description stated otherwise. Additionally, the packing was covered in a layer of dirt so thick I couls not read the label 
 "Academ's Fury" tries to compensate for a weak plot by switching viewpoints every few pages. The previous book, "Furies of Calderon", more interesting. Nothing at all like Butcher's wizard/detective series.  If you enjoy J.V. Jones' works, then I expect you'll enjoy this sequel 
 I'm glad I read this book for the subject matter, though there were so many problems with it I can't wholeheartedly recommend it. Cohen bases the book on the memories of old people, and some of their resistance efforts sound like pretty tall tales. I couldn't help but make the comparison with an 89-year-old gentleman I know who claims he sat on a purse snatcher until the police came. Some of the feats they credit themselves with accomplishing are simply unbelievable. There are also discrepancies. For example, Vitka is once called upon to bury a body in a forest in great haste, and I assume we're supposed to think she did it with her bare hands since she had no tools with her. Then much later in the story Vitka sees a dead body for the first time. Huh? Vitka, however, is the real heroine of the story, brave and selfless. Abba is an intriguing person, but my impression was that he gave the orders and took care of himself while his women did all the work. His fanaticism in later years was disturbing, though after what he lived through it is hard to judge him fairly. It's uplifting to know some Jews did fight back and that many lives were saved because of their courage, and that's the best part of the story 
 I've been a loyal Norton anti-virus & utilities software customer since the stone age, but like several other reviewers, I'm deeply disappointed that Norton Internet Security 2007 is incompatible with ZoneAlarm Pro, Sunbelt CounterSpy, and Microsoft AntiSpyware, and even more deeply disappointed that I had to crack the shrinkwap to find that out. Once upon a time, Norton  was the epitome of well-designed, thoughtful, customer-centric software, but they've degenerated into outsourced hacks trading on a well-established name. I'll be returning Symantec's software if I can, and buying ZoneAlarm's A/V package instead 
 My daughter and I had listened to the first two audio books, "The Bad Beginning" and "The Reptile Room", both narrated by Tim Curry, so we were very disappointed by "The Wide Room." Tim Curry was a fabulous narrator, why did they not continue to use him? His voice has just the right quality of evil mischief to it, and as an actor he really brought the book to life. Often, the person who wrote the book is not the best person to read it and this is the case with Lemony Snicket. His whiney, lispy voice was so bad it was a distraction. Curry's fabulous, velvety voice oozed malice and delight and the loss of him was a loss to the quality of the story. Lemony Snicket narrating his own story is truly an "Unfortunate Event! 
 Don't get me wrong I love the Stones, but "More Hot Rocks, Big Hits & Fazed Cookies" shouldn't have been released in 2002. Why? Most of this material could have been bonus material on the appropriate albums, but I understand show biz greed. Also, fans may have fond memories of this album, such as my brother, who I bought this for. One big problem he had was the opening track, "Tell Me," which was longer than the LP version back in the 70's. I can't believe no reviewers have noticed this, and that was one of the key reasons he wanted this collection; and it's not there! I call that tampering with history wouldn't you? Another problem he had, was the bonus material [disc 2] screws up the running order he so fondly remembered.   If you're buying this for nostalgic reasons you may be disappointed. If you are new to this collection it might be just fine.   
 I only have three words for this bit of tripe Boring,Boring,Boring. 
 This is not a book and I have no idea what a "sourcing fee" is.  Save your money and don't buy this item 
 I thoroughly enjoyed previous entries in the "Cat Who..." series, but this one was very disappointing.  In fact, I was so disappointed in this one that I pulled out a couple of older ones to see if my tastes had simply changed!  No, the book just doesn't measure up.  As another viewer commented - too cutesy, too predictable, too little mystery.  I will look for subsequent titles at the library rather than purchase them in hardback.  I hope this is just an oddball flop 
 If you haven't read anything on e-commerce at all, or if you're a total newbie, the latter half of this book may offer some useful advice on how to start an online business. For someone who is already in the business or has already done some research, this book merely repeats a lot of well-known tips. Even then, some of the tips, like in section on affiliate programs, are just theoretical assumptions and projections with very little practical information on how to actually attract sales and traffic.  As for the first part of the book where Allen demonstrates how he could earn $24k in one day, I find it totally unrealistic and it certainly won't happen to anyone reading the book unless he has Robert Allen's background to begin with. Even then, this sort of strategy won't cut it with today's wise and cynical netizens anymore. 
 he was cool in 1999, even his second english album had some decent tracks but that was his creative peak. One would think that after travelling around the world including places like india, ricky would have drawn a lot of inspiration for his music. He tried but he failed. This music just isn't good. I gave this album a second chance recently and it still sounds horrible! He can't decide whether he wants to be hip hop or bollywood or what. He should just stick to what he does best with his latin-fused pop/rock sound instead of trying too hard to appear as a serious, credible artist 
 I got this cd becasue one i am a fan of glam rock, it was a good price and i am a fan or radioehead. How can you have soundtrack that is about the glam rock scene of the 70s and not include bowie. All of the covers are not nearly as good as the originals. The only good songs are Virgina Plain and Satelite of Love and Camel in the eye but those are the original songs and i have those songs allready. The songs of Venus and Furs dispointed me it seem Thom was trying to sound like Bryan Ferry on them it would have been better if he just used his own voice. If you want a good glam rock soundtrack may i suggest Hedwig and The Angry inch most of the songs are sung by one singer who has a better voice then most of the rock singers out today. That soundtrack acutally does not sound like a soundtrack which i think is best i am not a big fan of various artist cds. I ended up selling it for more then i paid for it. 
 Well, I suppose if you're a parent that has only been to Disneyland and never outside the U.S. yourself, this will be a godsend. Otherwise, you'll find the author both simplistic and attempting to be intellectual in a cutesy sort of way (why the postmodern touch of not capitalizing any section titles?)  My Romanian husband (both of us are academics) are taking my nine year old to Turkey, Romania, Hungary, and points along the way this spring, so I thought this would offer some pointers (nope!).  In the description, of course, the point that these EU countries were excluded from the author in lieu of tourist traps like Paris was not revealed. I'm taking my son to Transylvania, and reselling the book for more than I paid, thank you 
 I have not finished this book yet but so far I think this woman is a nut. Referring to grocery store shelves as morgues for "dead" food. That's just stupid and weird. No cooked food? None? Forget it, lady. She has some good ideas but they are taken to the extreme 
 I liked this book in the end but it took me awhile to warm up to the two people in the story.  The girl was a bit of a witch at times and the guy could be a real jerk.  I thought she was kind of pushy and demanding.  He was kind of shallow.  But by the end, I did start to warm to them, but he did still continue to be a jerk.  I think it was an ok book to read, but in the end I never fully came to like either one of them.  I have read better chicklit 
 If I could rate it no stars I would.Let me tell you that my son is now 8, and is perfectly normal, especially as a baby, but I'll tell you what YOU DON'T NEED A MICROWAVE....technically they are dangerous for the fomula,the safest thing to use is room tempature distilled water pour that in with the powdered formula give it HARD shake then your all set...It's that easy don't be lazy and take away vital nutrients from your baby by microwaving their formula 
 I cannot stress how bad these books are.  I'm giving this 1 star because Amazon doesn't allow 0 stars.  Unless you are like me and have to read all the books in the Star Wars series, please save yourself the terrible agony and skip these.  The stories are descent, it is the writing that is so darn bad.  It is full of cliches and trite expressions, terribly lame attempts at humor that were dumb the first time you heard them, but then the same dumb joke are repeated countless times.  In essence, these three books are the same story told three times.  If you are still interested in torturing yourself, go ahead and read them, but thumb screws would be less painful 
 I really thought I was going to enjoy this book. The author seemed like she was having difficulty filling the pages of this short book and it often seemed redundant. The themes "less is more" and "let your kids figure it out for themselves" are valid and virtuous, I just wish the book was written better 
 We have a home inspection business and I read many books on real estate topics. This book was OK but certainly not worth recommending to our inspection clients. Some of the topics discussed are irrelevant to home inspections - such as mold! There were many topics lacking in the amount of information the author provided. Maybe if you don't know anything about houses or construction you might learn a little bit from this book. If you have a novice level of knowledge about house inspections then you should buy a different book since this book won't teach you anything new 
 I had never read this book as I child but since I knew it was a classic I decided to buy it for my daughter.  I never realized that Curious George and his owner smoke pipes and make it look appealing.  I guess this has to do with the fact that this book is very old.  If you dont' mind giving your child the idea that smoking a pipe is acceptable than buy this book for your child.  Mine won't be reading it 
 The symphonies are capable of compelling one's emotions from the depth of tragic despair to the pinnacle of majestic triumph.  Karajan's interpretation leaves one with the overall sense of being drowned in a bowl of oatmeal.  The size of the Philharmoniker doesn't make up for their lack of enthusiasm or  of clean articulation.  Instead of reaching out and grabbing ones attention and enthralling them with its sheer genius, this interpretation is more a sedative, dulling the senses with its insipid blurriness.  
 In "The Lady in the Tower" Jean Plaidy sets off to make Anne Boleyn sympathetic-it does not work. In history, I view Anne as one of the most complex and intriguing characters, one whom I have grown to love. Anne Boleyn was smart, intriguing, mysterious, and dark yet she was still kind, relgious and irresistable.  In this novel, she seems to be none of these.  Jean Plaidy's Anne Boleyn is dull, mechanical, moral, sweet, and arrogant(if I had read the sentence "I had many admirers" one more time, I just might have thrown it out the window).  I felt like I was told of Anne's good qualities, rather than shown them.  Also, Plaidy's Anne is quite judgemental, which I have never seen the actual Anne as being.  Anne is the first to judge her sister Mary, Henry, Her father, and most of all Cardinal Wolsey.  Never have I been more confused as to a character's relationship with another character.  For instance, we are told over and over again how much Anne dislikes Wolsey, but in the next sentence she says "poor old man" or "I felt sympathy for him".  Also, many of the facts of the story are repeated over and over again and almost all of the book is Anne repeating politics.  I would have enjoyed hearing about Anne's personal life, for once 
 I'll have to admit the book cover sounded interesting enough, but it seems NR gets into everything by threes, and it gets to be a bit much. I thought the women in this book were as goofy as all get-out, as well as an embarrassment to the female gender. And I never cared much for that. She had all the couples climbing into bed together too soon. The plot surrounding the Three Fates was a great idea, but the prose failed to follow through. I still think NR's first books were some of her best, and I still believe she's one of the greatest romance writers of all times. I'm just not big on this book. I've read much better with NR's name on the cover 
 I wanted to get my 20-month-old some fun but educational bath toys and found that the market is greatly lacking. I decided to order these hoping that they would be solid plastic and not hold water. I won't buy the squirt type toys anymore for my son because they are impossible to keep clean and have to be thrown away after a few months. Needless to say, these are squirt toys even though the description says nothing of it. I was willing to give the toys the benefit of the doubt because I really liked the shape matching features and my son is at the stage where he loves matching shapes, colors, etc. I took them out of the mesh bag, which is great to have for bath toys though they could have included a suction cup for hanging it up, and I realized that the plastic on some of the turtles is extremely flimsy. When my son tries to match the shells to the turtles, the body of the turtles just cave in and he can't get it on. Not all the turtles are this way, but most of them are. I regret wasting my money on these. What a rip off! Avoid at all costs!  If you're looking for a fun, open-ended yet affordable tub toy, try the tub stickers by Alex. There are a bunch of varieties, they are super easy to clean and come with a mesh bag with suction cups to hang up in your bath or shower to drip dry. My toddler LOVES them 
 I just received the book "Exhibition Design" today from Amazon.  I was very excited to find the title because there are so few books on the subject of museum exhibition design.  I was however very disappointed with the overall quality of the book. I have other W. W. Norton books ( Building the Empire State) and I own close to 300 architecture and design books.  I have never been so shocked at the poor quality of the photography in any of my books. Some of the photos in Exhibition Design book were not sharp....some where so dark you could not tell what was really going on in the exhibit...but most seem like they were photographed with a camera phone.  I was even shocked at the poor picture resolution of the Ralph Applebaum exhibits (blurry non sharp pictures and poorly lit)... I have a couple of books that cover the same projects and the photos in those books are wonderful...I assumed that companies like Applebaum send out a specific press kit with professional photographs.  I guess I have learned that I should always see a design book in person before buying it on line 
 This is a well written and clever book, and the author is very talented. The thing is, I'm a little irritated and bored by the story of a 20-something, commitment phobic, seemingly adolescent kind of guy who is such an emotional midget that he can't even say "I love you." The protagonist reminds me of the quintessential young (immature) single guy whose self destructiveness is matched only by his narcissism...the kind of guy women (girls?) really go for until they get a little older and grow a backbone. Harry's a horrible jerk until she draws a line in the sand...then he realizes how much he cares and wants her back...have all of us not lived or heard this scenario in some way a zillion times since we began dating? Are we not tired of it yet? Maybe I'm getting old...it's just not very cute or alluring anymore...it was hard for me to sympathize and consequently hard for me to stop rolling my eyes.     
 Everyone keeps telling me this is a classic.  I think it's just awful.  It reads like it was written: a rambling, unedited, ill-considered, weakly plotted piece of whimsy jotted down by an ailing old lady... was riding her reputation here - Macabea is just someone who comes and goes.  This novel just isn't finished 
 This DVD was made after baby one more time exploded onto the scene. it contains no performances or music by britney, and only has a few pictures of her. It's just a bunch of interviews with people from her hometown in louisianna...all of which have hair straight out of the 80s and don't work well in front of cameras. It's been recorded on a home video camcorder obviously.  my advice is to skip this...save your money, it's a snoozefest. Even if you area  huge britney fan, you'll end up regretting buying this 
 For any number of reasons I can probably say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I understand that a lot of people think this is genius. I am not one of them. Personally, I don't find endless descriptions of sex with minority boys to be very entertaining reading, let alone genius. I also don't find pointless prose that appears to have no discernable thread of thought to have much value. Personally, I like to read good story tellers, authors like Tom Robbins or Salman Rushdie. Naked Lunch is about as opposed to them as you can reasonably get.  This is one of those books that sounds a lot better when someone translates it for you. In reading the preface where Norman Mailer talks about it in the context of the court proceedings in the 1960s, the book sounds interesting and culturally pertinent. However, upon reading it the book falls far short of the lofty status we get from Mailer's answers on the stand. I understand how Alan Ginsberg, a proclaimed NAMBLA member, would find it's material suitable. I wonder about Mailer though. While I'll never take a stand against a person's writing what they want, I do take pause when someone recommends something like this.  This is not literature so much as a heroin clouded view of the author's own serious problems and his interpretation of our culture's deficiencies. The notion that this is the "naked" truth, or lunch as it is so called, is so absurd that the book should never have been accepted as remotely resembling cult literature, in the past, present, or future. Who reads this and resonates with it? Who thinks, "Yes, gay sex with boys is what my mind is all about? Oh, and all the better that they're Arabs!" Very few people, the author included. Burroughs himself admits this was difficult to write. This is probably due to the fact that the vignettes portrayed here do not, in fact, represent anything so much as the anarchy resplendent in the author's own mind while he struggled with various addictions. As a case study in heroin and morphine addiction, this may have some merit. As a counterculture commentary on society I find it worthless.  This isn't about my sensibilities being assaulted - far from it. If I can read & enjoy Robbins's linguistic forays into sex with nuns, I can handle just about anything. I'm not offended with flying sperm so much as I am insulted that anyone felt this was worth reading; that I was lured into thinking this was a work of art. It's not.   Sometimes I read books that don't suit me, but I understand why someone would like it. This book falls squarely in the camp where people feel they need to proclaim it genius because they're so confused or intimidated by it. This book is far from genius. The author admits it was put together from scraps of things written while he was in his heavy heroin addiction, and that he vaguely remembers much of it. I don't see how, or in what context, this book will appeal to anyone other than a case study of a certain segment of people at a certain instance in time in America 
 This is the sort of rubbishy book you get from writers who are sufficiently well-established not to need to make the effort any more.     The book lacks any worthwhile plot. It just meanders from A to B to C to D until, presumably, the writer thinks he has written enough arbitrary random material in a clever-clever manner to call it a "book". Then, the end. Off it goes to the publisher.    The content is unnecessarily overcomplicated. Too many characters, in too many places, are brought in. Too many clever things are said for the sake of saying clever things. Not enough happens. Result: a mess, cobbled together, a boring old-fashioned pretentious book that wastes the reader's time.     2/5          
 I guess this author doesn't bother to check his "facts". Too much work perhaps. Many, many errors. Clearly, he didn't even bother to read Asimov's autobiography completely. One of many errors: He thinks Marty Greenberg and Martin H. Greenberg are the same person. In Asimov's autobiography, he says in several places they are 2 different people. Asimov goes to great lengths in his autobiography to stress they are 2 different people. So much so, that he he refers to MHG as 'Marty the Other' in several places. This is just one of several errors. When someone makes as many errors as White does, how can you trust anything he says? Although Asimov wrote fiction and non-fiction, White seems to have blended the 2 in one book. However, how can you tell which part is fiction and which part is non-fiction? 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 As an Artist (Painter) who buys many art books and counts Jenny Saville as one of his favorite younger painters, I have been eagerly awaiting this books release.  I was also fortunate enough to get the Catalogue for Saville's Territories exhibition, and not I don't want to sell it.  Considering the quality of the Territories and Migrants publications, my expectations for this book were admittedly high.  I also saw both shows in person.  As for this book, Disappointing is an understatement.  Let's start with the obvious, it is incomplete and does not contain any of her earlier work and the text is nothing new, just a collection of older stuff.  Then the reproduction quality is poor, the images are too small, the colors aren't accurate, they're overly contrasting.  This leads me to believe that someone that never saw the actual works ran the images through some Photoshop printing filter and didn't actually compare the printed images to the paintings.  In addition, the layout of the artwork in the book is just plain bad.  Instead of centering the images on the page, they hug the center, which makes them awkward to look at.  For a book publisher, this is unforgivable.  The positive aspects of the book are:  well, there's finally a book on Saville and the photos of her studies, references and studio a well done, in fact there could be more.  They do provide detail shots of her painting, which is mandatory with her work considering the scale.  However, the few positives can't make up for a very poor book overall on an important contemporary artist.  One reviewer said, "Move over Lucian Freud", I think not.  A comparison cannot be made until Saville is in her 80's, then we'll (well someone will) talk.  While her earlier work is very impressive, I'm becoming concerned about where she is going paint wise.  The earlier work has "character", the newer work and pieces from the Migrants exhibition seem slick, rushed and overly pretty.  The new work also lacks the conceptual strength of the early work (her weak point anyway).  It seems to me she's becoming a clich of herself.  The best comparison I can think of is the animation style of the early Simpsons or South Park compared to later years.  The rough edges and distinctiveness have disappeared, replaces by standardization and predictability, never a good thing for an artist.  I hope that this phase of Saville's career will pass quickly.  Final Score  4 out of 1 
 Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) and Roy O'Bannon (Luke Wilson) reunite to recover the Imperial Seal of China and avenge the death of Chon's father, the Keeper of the Seal.  They are joined by Chon's sister, the beautiful and equally dangerous Lin (Fann Wong).  The chemistry of Wilson and Chan is as delightful as ever, but that (and the beautiful and talented Wong) is about the only reason to watch this tired comedy.  Even the action scenes are uninspired.  A disappointment 
 A man of faith with the faith unspecified.  Back in the 1800's when his folks were in politics, they firmly believed the wrong side won the AMerican REvolution.  This book, written by a subject of the British throne reveals why Bush once again places us as peons and mercenaries for the british imperial crown.  Back in the 1800's the bush family joined Cotton MAther of Yale in burning landowners as witches in order to steal their profitable farms.   Now he demonizes the IRaqi nation and kills an estimated million of them to steal their oil fields  Nothing new under the sun. Only do not call it faith  FAith in the gun, maybe.  Saint JAmes writes even the devil believes in God and shudders in fear. Faith without good works is nothing. By their fruits will you know them. Bush's fruits stink to high heaven.  For a faith with good works read a theologian like the REverend Father John Dear's Jesus the rebel, and learn why every Christian faithful and true must firmly oppose George W Bush.   By the way, this piece of partisan politicizing which helped steal our 2004 elections by deceiving countless well-intended but eagerly gullible people is now going for fourteen cents. 
 The brugo mug is a hyped piece of junk. The 'tip and cool' feature on mine doesn't even work (when you select the 'tip & cool' setting on the dial, no coffee comes out at all - brilliant!). It works fine as a regular thermos-type thing, and it looks cool, but don't be fooled. Save yourself the shipping costs and high price of this faulty paperweight and get something from a local store or cafe. 
 Well, after listening to this CD I'm beginning to understand why Ringo didn't do too much singing while in The Beatles. He probably wasn't allowed to. The songs "Only You" and especially the late Johnny Burnette's "You're Sixteen" are practically raped on this album. Yes, I know, there are much worse voices around, but that alone doesn't make this CD any better 
 I agree with those in the majority who have reviewed this book.  It was a terribly boring story and hard to follow at times.  I am a huge Minette Walters fan.  In my opinion, she's right up there with Ruth Rendell.  She normally writes very captivating stories with a true storyteller's touch but this veered off in quite a different direction than anything else I have read by her.  The word by word e-mails from one character to another were dreadful.  I found myself skimming over them.  It appeared to me that they were put there to take up page space because they certainly were not there to enrich the story or provide anything of interest.  There wasn't even really a mystery here.  It was obvious what was going on right away.  I did not care for this book one bit.  The two star rating is because I do love this author and one star would just be shameful (although two stars seems generous).  
 Terrible direction, terrible writing, it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with. Although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie CLUE, it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid. It was a total watse of good celluloid 
 THIS CD I BOUGHT IS VERY NICE BUT I DON'T RECOMMEND BUYING IT USED. THIS CD AND UNPLAYED PIANO BOTH SKIP . THEY ARE BOTH DAMAGED 
 After souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums (a feat achieved by only a handful of bands) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc. The Bunnymen built their reputation on moody, psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in Ocean Rain. For this release the band moves into more 'mainstream' territory, eschewing album-wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach. Unfortunately these lightweight songs don't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned. If you're new to the Bunnymen you're probably better served by checking out their first four albums (Crocodiles, Heaven Up Here, Porcupine and Ocean Rain) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts Evergreen and Flowers 
 This book is absolute garbage.  I would never waste time to write a review unless I thought it was absolutely necessary.  All this book has to offer is a lesson in high school economics.   There is no content on trucking at all, maybey one page--one!!  These authors canned a bunch of economic/marketing mumbo jumbo and slapped a trucking label on it.   I am very dissapointed that Amazomn would even allow such a piece of s**t to be sold on their website.   Use this book to start a fire in your fireplace...that's all it's good for.  I'm not joking 
 This is not an outline.  It's not a study guide.  It's not a resource tool, or at least not a good one.  It's a poorly constructed glossary.  Any term that is defined is defined in every chapter in which the term is used.  If you want to see "Stike Price" and "Present Value" defined twenty times each, then maybe this book is for you.  At every opening, the left-hand page has terms, while the right-hand page has lines for notes.  That means you're getting 120 pages of notes, not 240.  When you take out the repeated definitions, it's much shorter than that.  To give an example of the poor quality of this book: the chapter about the Black-Scholes Formula doesn't even incude the formula 
 I expected something less sloppily put together on surrealist games, a fascinating and rich topic. This little book contains a few classic surrealist little gems, but it is a rather unconvicing as a whole, too much of a hodge-podge that lacks structure, design and sparks. Or maybe it is surrealist games that have become a bit tiresome. Or maybe playing is more fun than reading about other people's games 
 Hush is a shallow and blatant 'monster mash' of characters disguising itself as an epic. culminate Batman story. Everything from Lee's generic and derivative character re-imagings (like what you'd expect to find in something produced by Image comics) to the plot. And by plot, I mean the tiringly episodic reintroduction of a character followed by quick battle and then 'on to the next one', sequence that only stops at the unveiling of a new, non compelling villain. In other words, if you're into mainstream american comics, you'll love this. If you want a real Batman story, Check out "Long Halloween," Alan Moore's "Killing Joke", Frank Miller's 'Dark Knight Returns" and Neil Gaiman's "Arkham Asylum: Serious House on Serious Earth

 Normally, I am very open to listening to new music -especially scenster/indie-hop - and when, months ago now, I'd heard about the Bravery I was intrigued. I turned on the radio here in San Francisco to the best indie station on the planet and kept my ears open. I remember hearing a song and thinking, "wow, the Strokes' new song is amazingly good." Then, when the announcer stated that the song was in fact performed by The Bravery, I was horrified.   Simply stated: how are these guys NOT the Strokes? Sorry, but they sound exactly like them... but not as good. Lyrically, they are not as original and the lead singer does not have the same passion or enthusiasm in his voice as the lead singer for the Strokes.   However, lucky for the Bravery, people are actually buying that they are a unique and catchy band. What a joke 
 I spent 13 years as a Marine and at the time that the Crucible started I was an instructor at the School of Infantry. I did not think that the Crucible helped , in fact the Marines that I saw after the Crucible seemed to be weaker and they were whiners. Of course this does not apply to all but I think that Boot camp has gotten soft in the last couple years. The Marine Corps lets society dictate what we can and cannot do. Civilians need to stay out of the Military way of life. If they want to take part in our life than Enlist or get commisioned. I am not saying that I dont like this book, it may be a great book but the subject is not good. Semper F 
 I bought this for my dad's birthday.  He is a fisherman.  This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen.  Not entertaining, not funny, not interesting, not even a fishing movie.  I bought it based on several reviews I read.  This is the first time I've been led astray on Amazon.  The "5 Stars" rating must be a review by people with a financial interest in this waste of digital energy 
 I bought this book in preparation for a party.  When the book showed up, I was severly disappointed - it's basically the same recipe over and over again using different tequilas.  The book does briefly talk about a lot of different tequilas and has a few (and I do mean few) recipes for other margaritas (fruit etc).  But instead of buying this book, try [web address] you'll find a much better variety and save yourself the money 
 Don't waste your money.  I bought two of these.  A few weeks later several moles tunneled within 10 feet of the one in the same places as last year.  I put one in my gardern - a few weeks later a mole tunneled right alongside the molechaser as if to see what it was to his delight!  Total waste of money like everthing else I've tried except Nash loop traps 
 good movie, bad copy!  I ordered it because it was cheap.  However, picture quality is POOR; fuzzy, washed-out, blurry.  It looks like it's recorded in superlongplay.  The shortness of the tape would seem to confirm this 
 This book really fell flat.  Lynne Hinton's first book Friendship Cake what such a good read.  I was sincerely disappointed in her second work.  She had a good beginning, but after you read awhile the characters begin to become redundant, and a little dull.  There was some hope of a good plot, but something was definitly missing.  Try again Lynne, you have talent.  Maybe try a sequel to Friendship Cake.  The characters that you developed in that book are really good 
 "The Golden Bowl" (1904), written by Henry James (1843 -1916), is a book that many consider a classic. I read it many years ago, and decided to read it again after hearing a friend mention it, and realizing I didnt remember much about its plot.  The story is set in England, and its main characters are Prince Amerigo, Maggie Verver and her father Adam, and Charlotte Stant, Maggies best friend. Amerigo is an Italian nobleman that happens to be poor, and decides to marry the very rich Maggie in order to become wealthy. Maggie has a very close relationship with her father, and decides that Adam should marry Charlotte, so that he wont be alone. What Maggie doesnt know, however, is that Amerigo was the lover of her friend Charlotte. That seemingly small detail, that Amerigo and Charlotte go to great lenghts to hide, complicates the relationships of the four characters, and immerses them in a web of lies and simulation. Appearances and reality, what is more important? And what doesn a golden bowl have to do with all that?  If you are interested in finding the answer to those questions, and dont mind the fact that James style is somewhat baroque in this book, you might be interested in reading "The Golden Bowl". The descriptions are great, and the author excels at making you understand what these couples are thinking, and feeling. On the other hand, not much happens, and this is the kind of book that can be easily forgotten. That is what already happened to me once, and it is likely to happen again, at least to me. I dont recommend "The golden bowl", due to the fact that there are other books out there that are unforgettable, books that simply make you remember them...  Belen Alcat  PS: If you are interested in reading this book, please do so. "The golden bowl" was not for me, but maybe you will understand and appreciate it better 
 This is a wreck of a movie.   The plot is completely incoherent, even on repeated viewings, and apparently the same holds true for people who are already familiar with the material, from looking at what some of the other reviewers had to say.  I was not familiar with the backstory, which made it an even more confusing experience for me. I don't know how any reviewer could possibly praise this movie, because movies are first and foremost entertainment, and the film makers couldn't even string together anything remotely resembling a narrative. As others have said, there are scores of dead ends, if the characters have motivations there's no effort to explain them to us, and some of the acting is so bad it borders on the painful.  I bought this movie because a formerly trusted reviewer wrote that it had some flaws but would be a fun experience for sci fi fans. Nothing could be further from the truth, I will never trust that reviewer again, and I would advise the fanboys to stop hyping this movie. Even most bad films have some redeeming qualities that make them worth watching. This one does not -- it's a complete, utter waste of money, and I wish I could demand the film makers give me a refund. 
 This was the worst movie I have ever seen (and I've seen a few horrible ones!) the acting was terrible, the plot completely absurd and unrealistic, this is definitely NOT a D/s movie. I too am giving the movie away, I refuse to let anyone who is bent on seeing this movie actually pay for such an awful thing! (like *I* did) And I most certainly will never watch it again. 
 Richard Dawkins is a world-class evolutionary biologist and one of the best popular science writers working today.  His "The Blind Watchmaker" is, I think, the best layman's book on natural selection ever written; I re-read it every few years just to enjoy the clarity of his style.  "A Devil's Chaplain," then, is a book I really wanted to like.  I understood walking out of the bookstore that "Chaplain" would not, in the main, be about evolutionary biology.  And I have seen enough examples of scientists -- brilliant within their own areas of expertise -- who write commonplaces or even twaddle when off their home turf.  That caution did not prepare me for the spectacle of Dawkins's plunge into unselfconscious dogmatism and graceless bile in large sections of this book.  Portions of "A Devil's Chaplain" dealing with evolutionary biology are quite good.  Sections dealing with "memes" are less satisfactory.  I actually finished Dawkins's first essay on memes _less_ convinced that they are a viable analog to genes than when I went in.  In particular, Dawkins's  postlog on why science is not a meme was unconvincing, weak argumentation at best, hand-waving at worst.  Dawkins's opinions on social institutions and politics recall William F. Buckley's  quip that it would be preferable to be ruled by citizens drawn randomly from the Boston telephone book than by the members of Harvard's faculty.  Dawkins's disparagement of the concept of trial by jury (in favor of `more rational' trial by judge) misses the point of that institution in a particularly elephantine way.  His viewpoint is elitist in a distinctively cozy, English, university-don manner.  Dawkins seems so nauseated at the thought that some gaggle of dimwitted proles might sit in judgement of _him_ that he is oblivious to the notion that an individual judge -- albeit a credentialed professional and Dr. D's intellectual equal (more or less) -- might treat him unfairly.  And some of the notions Dawkins advances are just loopy.  For instance, at one point he imagines being in the presence of a genetically-engineered approximation of an australopithecene and "tearfully taking her hand in mine" -- as if the hominid in question were an actual australopithecene, not a laboratory-made chimera, and as if the poor creature were capable of understanding his emotion, let alone reciprocating it.  "A Devil's Chaplain" is an instant classic, but not of any sort that Richard Dawkins could have intended.  With it, he joins the list of brilliant specialists who missed their opportunity to leave intact the assumption that they were sages in a broad way, instead of solely in their fields of specialization 
 Thirteen year olds can be easily impressed by cheap tricks, "heartfelt" lyrics, and a lot of pretty lights. So it goes with some reviewers of this movie. This movie contains the unending internal reflections of about 6 or 7 different characters. These reflections never really go anywhere, never draw substantive conclusions. Primarily, there is just a lot of whining. THe only exception is the Sean Penn character until the end, when he whines at least as much as everybody else. "War is tough" is one of the main themes of this movie. Is that really a revelation?   One thing you learn early on in acting or directing classes is to "play opposites," meaning put contrasting things in juxtaposition so that the contrast highlights both sides. An example is when a very evil character such as Richard III uses humor. "I'll have her - but not for long." THe fact that the guy is joking about killing his new bride makes him all the more evil to us. At the same time, perhaps we can't avoid laughing in spite of ourselves.  OK, so this director had some of the same classes I did, but he has to use the technique over and over and over and over and over and ... until it starts seeming boring and banal. War scene, lots of dying. Oh look, a pretty butterfly! More blood and bullets. Oh gee, the light going through that leaf is beautiful! Use this trick once or twice and maybe it seems new to the uninitiated audience. Use it more than three times and you are asking for trouble. This director must use it 10-15 times. He turns it into a cliche. When the audience can predict when they are about to see the next opposite, you have overdone it.  So what do we have so far? A bunch of whining character crying about war being bad and a bunch of contrast scenes. And really, that's pretty much it. The movie could have been cut in half with no loss because if there is one thing this movie is, It Is Redundant. It is spoon-feeding you the same message over and over and over again. Ouch, war hurts! Ew, mutilated bodies are yucky. Oh gosh, a little bird got hurt!!! We are so nasty! We must stop this war!!! (never mind the fact that thousands of little birds get eaten alive by cats every day)  The director focuses on the yucky and inconvenient aspects of war - which I suppose would be briliant, except I think almost everybody on the planet already knows that wars are yucky and inconvenient. It's almost as if the author doesn't Believe we know, that he somehow thinks we missed it. And if only he reminds us at every possible repetitive opportunity, again and again and again, well, then maybe we will "get it" and start opposing wars, I guess. Never mind about Hitler and the 6 million jews. Never mind about Pearl Harbor. War is a yucky thing done by bad men, or nice whimpy men trapped in a situation by bad men. It has no meaning and there is nothing remotely noble about it. We were just wasting our time fighting the Nazis. The Nazis were just misunderstood! If they want to cook 6 million jews in the ovens, let them do it.  An adult movie deals with realties and poses questions like, "how do I get myself to do something that I don't want to do, but that I know I should?" Making yourself do things that are not pleasant is one of the hallmarks of reaching adulthood. This movie takes a very adolescent perspective and asks, "if I whine enough, can I get out of my chores?"   The dumbest scene in this movie is when the Jim Caveziel character is surrounded by Japanese and for no reason whatsoever, will not surrender. He stands there in the middle of about 40 Japanese soldiers and decides (after looking at some pretty leaves and butterlies) to raise his weapon so they will shoot him. The funny thing is, it's completely unnecessary: his comrades have already been warned. His death accomplishes nothing but relief for the audience - he can no longer utter his inane internal monologues.   I think if you are a left-winger or have a thing for looking at the bodies of naked boys, you will love this movie. It's the kind of propaganda piece that a vacant, unquestioning mind will eat up. If your leanings are more adult, however, you may hate it. You'll wonder why the story is so one-sided, why nobody seems to believe in the causes they are fighting for, even though the Japanese did attack us, and the Germans did some naughty things too. None of that seems to matter to the storyteller. "Why can't we all get along?" he cries, as the germans load another group of jews into the ovens and turn up the heat...  A final note: if you want to see two really good war movies that make valid criticisms of the "war spirit" and how wars are conducted, see "Gallipoli" and/or "Breaker Morant." These movies are extremely effective in making their points without using cartoonish characters. The characters are real and the plots move the story foreward.  "The Thin Red Line" is what I would call "professed brilliance." A couple of simple tricks are used to try to impress the audience. But there is no real meat here. It's just a bunch of pointless whining. The poetry is poorly written and pretentious. And the characters are not real.   
 This novel revisits the major themes of "Prep": (1) social outcast girl (2) with difficult, overly demanding father (3) grows up to believe that men cannot love her.  (4) Becomes fixated with notion that she is unattractive/boring.  (5) Has blissful car ride with unattainable hot boy who flirts during the car ride and then (6) has no contact with him for years.  (7) Has demoralizing "affair" with compulsive sex addict who pursues other women while also sleeping with her.  (8) Lacks interest in boy (tutor in "Prep," earnest boyfriend here) who worships and bores her.  Is eclipsed by prettier girls.  Obsesses with the notion that only pretty girls will ever count and she's not one of them.  (9) Takes baby steps towards "makeover" (learns to eat pasta in front of others in Prep, thereby displaying newfound confidence; loses the glasses and gets contact lenses here) but never displays any real spunk, energy, or appetite for life.    The difference is that where "Prep" is claustrophobically, stiflingly intense, and compellingly readable if lifeless, "The Man of My Dreams" is mere pallid, unsatisfying chick lit: it's a fairly lightweight, non-tragic novel about young woman coming of age & trying to find Mr. Right.  But it's chick lit without the fun accessories, the overpriced shoes, the drunken one-night stands with the wrong guy, the hilarious/reckless girlfriends, the glamorous job, the fun urban nightclubs.  Less intelligent writers like Plum Sykes have produced more satisfying fare, like "Bergdorf Blondes," because their characters have some fun and glamor.  
 I bought this book, in part because of the glowing reviews others have left for it, and in part out of a general interest in the subject, having read several fictional books which dealt with it. I was completely shocked, however, to find a poorly written, trite piece of crap. Seriously. Now, I'm not claiming to be a great writer myself - I'm sure this review will be ripe with spelling & gramatical errors - but I'm not a professional author, so I shouldn't be held to a strict standard. Mr. Sutton, who claims many academic credentials, certainly couldn't name "writing ability" amung them. He regularly reverts to the passive voice, uses academic cliches repeatedly (in one paragraph he mentions the "Hegalian Dialectic" 3 times...), and puts words he thinks are particularily important in bold, like an elementary school text book. Furthermore, his conclusions are very poorly supported, given the nature of his supposed "research", and he is prone to refer to evidence which doesn't support his point whatsoever. I have no problem with the idea that skull and bones, and secret societies in general exist; but Mr. Sutton's work doesn't exactly pull it all together or even convince me that our lives and the American government are really puppets of the above mentioned orders. One of Mr. Sutton's first assertions is that he is going to use "Occam's Razor" - that the simplest explenations are usually correct. Fine. But he overlooks the simplest explenation of them all - rich people who go to elite schools help out other rich people. Wealth and power in America (and throughout most of the world) are self-perpetuating. People in power assist others to stay in power. Its not a secret, its sociology. Don't waste your time, - and don't belive the inevitable conclusions that I'm part of the "conspiracy" for speaking ill of this book. I didn't go to any Ivy League school, btw

 Oh how I wish I had checked these reviews before I purchased this! No wonder the price was slashed on this. Well unlike someone else on here, I did receive instructions however they were not helpful in ANY way. Once I could find the instructions printed in English, I got started. You have to snap 4 panels together but as you snap each one, the others are falling apart again. I will save time here and just say that everything everybody else said above was exactly the case for me. Lousy not to include the bulb also! 
 Consumers should be aware of serious design flaws which exist in Samsung DLP televisions.  Cooling fans and color wheels are highly susceptible to failing.  (As a non-techniocal person I should have no idea what these parts are, but alas, I bought a Samsung DLP)  Expect these to fail within 1-2 years.  Expect to pay approx $400 to replace the color wheel and $200 to replace the colling fan.  That is, if your service technician can find them in stock anywhere.  These parts are commonly in a national backorder because of the very high failure rates.    You should also expect the lamp to fail sooner than advertized.  Many people need to purchase a new lamp between 1-2 years, and some more often than that.  The lamp costs approx $150-$250 depending on your model, but you should be able to replace it yourself without too much difficulty.  This cost will be in addition to replacement costs for the color wheel and colling fan.  Please remember that these maintenance costs are recurring, and you will have to fix them again in another 1-2 years.  While I was very satisfied with the quality and performance of my DLP, my color wheel failed very early.  I called tech support to report a grinding noise, and was told to "turn it off", wait 15 minutes, and turn it back on like this would fix the problem.  After doing this for a while, the color wheel finally failed, actually shattered!  Now I am out of warranty, and Samsung wants nothing to do with me.  I have even tried ordering the part myself from two different online vendors, and they are both backordered indefinitely!  It has been 6 weeks and they have no estimate for when this part will be available.  Samsung cannot even give me an estimate when the supply of replacement parts is expected to meet demand.  I have had my TV for 18 months, and apparently there is a national epidemic of them breaking at the same time!  I have a 42" Samsung Plasma which is a beautiful set along with a 26" CRT.  Both are wonderful products, but Samsung is selling DLP LEMONS and will not stand behind them.  DLP is a great bargain up front, but a maintenance NIGHTMARE!  You will pay in the long run, and by the long run I mean every 2 years.  If you still want to purchase a DLP television, PLEASE BUY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY!  IT WILL SAVE YOU A TON, BUT YOU WILL STILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE CIRCUIT CITY TECH TO FIND PARTS WHICH MAY TAKE MONTHS!    I expect Samsung to abandon their design flaw riddled DLP sector, and focus on their beautiful plasma line.  Expect DLP prices to drop even further, but please...LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP 
 The tao te ching is a great book, I'm not giving that a one star review, I'm giving mitchell's interpretation of it one star.  As many other reviews have stated, he doesn't speak chinese, so this translation is comprised of his reading other peoples' translations and what he thinks it means.  He then tries to modernize it and make it accessible to 21st century americans.  I like the old world feel of this book, you don't need to change swords to nuclear warheads, I know what a sword is.  At least though, this change makes sense, some chapters Mitchell changes so much, that the entire chapter loses its meaning.  A couple chapters made no sense, so I went to the back of the book where he tells what parts he changed, and then I was able to understand exactly what Lao Tzu intended to say.  Don't buy this book.  
 "Ready for Anything" is a pointless book full of information and ideas that anyone who went through school should already know. I learned a long time ago to write things down instead of keeping them in my head and I also know that being organized gives me more flexibility and less stress so why would I want to read a book in which Allen writes about basic concepts in a philosophical way. Yeah this book might be good for someone who didn't pick up on these basic skills in Middle school but for me it was a waste of my time which I'm sure Allen would agree is not a good use of my skills.  Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this book because maybe then you will open yourself up to more time for "creativity" which is the point of the book in the first place 
 the plot in this book is very interesting. the bureau in question is adminitrated towards killing people who "deserves" it. their clients have to convince the leader that the person deserves to be killed. a man shows up and convinces the leader that it is HIM (the leader) that deserves to be killed, and this person agrees at last. interesting concept. but after a while the plot gets less interesting. L doesn't seem to manage his own idea, and things end up just sort of happening. not his best 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 Alan Alda is a funny man. But his book is not. He jumps from here to there leaving one to wonder where he is going with his story. Our book club was anxious to read something different but it was unanimous - thumbs down 
 Well, I really don't understand what's to be liked in Yoko's music. I mean... After Lennon's death she has released many many albuns... and they all seem to go unnoticed. And her music seems to have gone nowhere...   She is probably one of the richest people on Earth (thanks to the Lennon/McCartney songbook) and she must be just doing what she likes to do - to sing.  But that doesn't make her music good.  I love the Beatles and I respect her very much (I don't know and I don't care if she did or did not break up The Beatles) and I tried very hard to listen to her music many many times.  And I really like her very much. I do.  I tried to like her music... but I must face the truth: her music is awful. Her lyrics are dated. Her voice is bad. The production in the albums is bad. Her rhymes are cheesy. She seems to be recording the same five songs over and over. For those who adore her music, I just think she too overated. For those who don't... I don't blame them.  And that is sad because after John's death, I always hoped she would find her own success, writing, singing and recording with the best composers, musicians and producers in the business - just like the best.  But instead, everything around these recordings is third rate.  I am sorry to say... I wish I could see what other reviewers keep seeing in Yoko. Whatever it may be, it keeps eluding me.  I give her two stars because... well... I wanna be nice. 
 There are more than 140 popular chart pattern. I returned this book becuase whatever he mentioned is freely available on websites. I do not want to publicize any website. But do a search in Google for 'Stock Chart or Technical indicator' and you will get better explanation and tips than what is in this book. I can not believe people go to seminar to hear this guy. The GOLDEN RULE... If the system works then may be start a hedge fund.. If it does not then write a book...hold seminar... 
 no no no, i just don't like it, i recieved this for my birthday last month and i was frustrated with my in laws because for one, this cd is quite old. 2nd, this cd is hideous, besides the catchy "pop" the whole cd fails to strike a nerve with any of my senses.  I recomend just buying something recent or artistically endeavouring, not childish and ridiculou 
 This CD stinks. It's got the worst music. The only good song is "This is How We Do It".Don't buy it 
 This book was completely unintelligible to me.  I have read all the other enneagram books which were mostly quite interesting.  This one was an enigma wrapped in lunacy.  I did enjoy some of the weird sentences but I couldnt put it all together or figure out what I was supposed to take from it.  I have kept all my enneagram books except for this one.  I sold it.    Even Gurdjieff in Beelzebubs Tales is clear as sunlight compared to this 
 The author wants to fish out the contents of recent suspicions of the role and `function' manifestations of Judas.  Their observations may sound alien and dissimilar to many media discussions that have been going on in North America, and became more energetic during Easter. I feel they brushed the whole debate aside.  The momentum given to the arguments whether there was a `conspiracy' between Jesus and Judas is the works of the media - the newspapers, radios, and the TV - based on analysis allegedly emanating from ancient Coptic manuscripts (third or fourth century) - named Gospel of Judas. Analyzing, chemically, the ink of the manuscript remains controversial to me.  Was such action heretical?  I do not know but I believe this will lead to nowhere.  By rushing the information, which the National Geographic Society in Washington has uncovered, the media is trying to confuse our minds, like saying `there are more beautiful photographs of women than there are photographs of beautiful women'.  The American novelist James Cooper - has written, "" If the newspapers (media) are useful in overthrowing tyrants, it is only to establish a tyranny of their own"". Cooper pronounced those words in the mid 1800's when there was abundant news but little resources of intelligence to verify. Stunt news was then predominant.  And still is. Anything that attracts attention, a public figure, whatever he did, is news. Our century cannot be different from prior centuries when it comes to people trying to find proves and rationales for certain recorded actions and reactions that have taken place in previous times. The quest for discovering new venues will never stop as long as the progress in chemistry and technology continues on such quick pace. The point, though, is how the media is transmitting this data, and when.  For example: during the rule of the Bourbons in France, French gatherings in the royal court were very much similar to `sï¿½ances' where learned individuals, for instance, persons of high ranking families (mainly ladies), tried to rationalize the spiritualistic messages delivered by the distinguished Bishops, and Cardinals who had been appointed by the Pope. Such debates had notably been conducted in the short lull periods of peace times, when Europeans were not fighting each other and the material were printed by mass communication available during that era, but with restricted distribution. In their space of relaxation, rich and well fed and triumphant individuals tended towards exaggeration, so they extended their conversations to philosophize subjects such as `it's impossible to believe there is a God', or those who wished to demonstrate the degree of their `learning capabilities', so to speak, talked of how sceptical they were about the existence of God but never professed true atheism.  Some agnostics were doubtful and noncommittal about the whole subject of religion and wanted to be showy about their `enormous knowledge' and their `abilities' to discover new subjects for discussion. Some even equated such sï¿½ances with Freemasonry. Still, printed material on these meetings remained restricted. Renowned individuals like Verdi, Brahms, Tchaicovsky, Talleyrain, and Robespierre were famous agnostics.  Interestingly, in their lives they were peculiar kind of men, of no fixed occupation, vagabonds (but many of their works, whether good or bad, will remain ageless) and in their eloquent mother language parlance, they pretended to have acquired the luxury of `discovering' better, bright and distinct ideas with a supernatural attributes to even doubt the existence of God. And the media ran after them, propagated their views, and unearthed their personal memoirs and their mysterious and private exchange of intimated correspondence, much to the chagrin of the Church. Nowadays, the term `Conspiracy Theory' is having the greatest ascendancy. Like agnosticism, and scepticism in the old days.  The media is treating `Conspiracy Theorists' like window-dressing articles of a new fashion, a means of improving appearance and giving artificial and false impression. The media, to a group of conspirators, attributes any `action with a bang' to sinister design they have all performed together such as acts prohibited by law, or by means against the law.  But because human imagination is infinite, some media fat cats are going back in history to touch base with our Religion (Christianity)- and this book is not an exception and its related movie.  They are giving us the mental image of events that we always believed and perceived as real, as not anymore acceptable to the senses unless verified.  Think of it guys. Isn't it strange that on Easter Sunday this year (2006) there have been more media talks about Judas than Christ?  As far as I am concerned, these persons are loquacious, and very forceful in their trivial discussions that one might be led to pursue their pattern of offensive and garrulous thesis, supported by deft cameras and skilful writers. Many buy their books, which are becoming `best sellers', amid the sad division of our Church, and would agree with them on face value.   What a farce! 
 As someone who was on bed rest for the last trimester of my pregnancy I can relate to the character in that respect.  However, the story is so-so.  There are much better reads out there 
 I was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did. There is no plot, the characters described very poorly and the writing is definitely unimpressive (I would not mind the writing so much if the plot was there). Throughout the whole book all the main character does is answers the phone and gets coffee ... how exciting is that?   
 I try not to judge my vids the first time I do them because the bulk of my fitness dvd collection (which is very large) are comprised of ones that took some getting used to, but that I ended up loving.  This was not one of them - I have given this one 5 chances, and I still dislike it VERY much.  The set is SO cheesy, and so is Kathy.  Unfortunately, this is my first Kathy video - I have heard she has some good ones, but I am completely turned off by her and will not purchase another.  The timing was off, and even after I mastered the steps, they did not feel effective.  Sorry Kathy, I am looking elsewhere 
 I was disappointed in this memoir.  I'm a big fan of Richard Chamberlain's acting.  However, this book reads like one long psychotherapy session.  I came away from the experience feeling that Mr. Chamberlain is not a very complicated person.  The writing style and the book have too much of a surfacy, "sing-songy" quality for me 
 This book is a poor choice if you want to learn to program in the Pocket PC environment.  The back cover calls this a "practical guide" but the book spends most of the first six chapters describing how Windows CE programming evolved from Windows programming.  You must be fluent in Windows application development in C++ for this book to be useful.  The examples are poor and do not work with the Visual Tools software available at the Microsoft site 
 I bought this while in Philadelphia, and it was terrible except one song which I played endlessly for about a day and a half before I got tired of it, and this would eventually end up on the soundtrack of the film "Clerks" which was "Got Me Wrong". This was a noble attempt of showing that they can do acoustic as well as electric, but it didn't help if the songs weren't strong enough. 
 It is what is says it is. Soundtrack with voice overs. It is not just the music part of the soundtrack. Wanted just the music 
 Some of these chapters are out of date and not useful for the radiologist in general practice. I especially disprove of the Charboneau chapters. Rumack and Wilson are excellent 
  Almost 2 hours long. A film about filmmaking. A narcissistic view of the movie business. The film is about a film being shot, and ends when this is accomplished. We see what goes on in the daily lives of those involved in the work, from the director (the same Truffaut) to the producer, to the cast, to the stuntman. There's a curious lady, a wife to one of the employees, who sits knitting and watching her husband so he doesn't cheat on her during work. Everybody keeps busy working and flirting chaotically, and the only one who does not mix work and pleasure seems to be the director (and maybe the producer). It's supposed to be funny, and even nostalgic. There are visual references to the great classic directors in film history, to how the film industry has changed... One thing to learn from this story is that fiction plays a role in our lives: it serves as a contrast to the frivolity and emptiness of our real lives.  "Do you think the story of a woman who falls for her father-in-law can still be interesting today?", asks a reporter to the leading star. That question is quite revealing of what our world has become. Sex and alcohol keep these pitiful troupe working like gasoline keeps a car running. Another important moment is when the knitting lady (mentioned before) gets tired of watching so much promiscuity going around and starts yelling at the whole crew. What role does she play? Is she the typical conservative fun-spoiler? Or is she Truffaut's alter-ego? Hard to say. And that's one reason why this whole film is pointless. It just describes what goes on, which is not interesting at all, there's no plot, there are no interesting characters, only adults acting as children acting as adults.  In another scene the director's assistant, another sexy gal, after one of the female workers runs away with the stuntman and leaves her lover, says "I could leave a man for a film, but never a film for a man", which doesn't make her any more likeable to me.   At least if it had been only 60 or 80 minutes of film I would have given it 3 stars. A film as empty and pointless as its characters. 
 This book is really a travesty. The captions to the very nice photos were full of errors and were clearly written by someone who had not a clue as to what was in the photo. Save your money. There are so many excellent books on the subject, nearly any one of which is vastly superior to this laughable "book" on the Arts & Crafts Movement 
 I've been looking for Stella D'Oras' Round Egg Biscuits, they were a very dry airy kind of cookie, they had plain and frosted.  I loved the plain ones, they were round but had a scallopped edge to them with a hole in the center.  I can't find these anywhere and wish I could, if anyone knows where to find these please let me know 
 The book basically covers three subjects.  First, a political and historical background of Iraq and Saddam - Excellent.  Besides the history primer, Mr. Keegan also has some thought provoking, if negative,  remarks about Islam (or at least some of its variants) which I may research later.      Second, the events leading to the second gulf war - Poor at best.  I agree that Saddam had to go, preferably sooner than later.  Failing any political progress, war was a likely outcome.  Having terrorized his citizens, started two major wars and having a record of NBC/WMD weapons research he wasn't someone anyone felt comfortable having around.  The UN embargo wasn't working and medical/food shortages were killing up to 50.000 civilians a year, according to some pre-war estimates.  Mr. Keegan jumps firmly, but clumsily, into the pro-war bandwagon.  The issue of missing WMD is never really addressed very well.  Did the Western intelligence agencies really drop the ball?  Or did the US and the UK lie to their citizens in order to drum up support for an unpopular military intervention?  If it wasn't a lie, could the intelligence agencies have done any better?  If not, what lessons to learn from that?  His characterization of opponents to the war is lame.  Mr. Chirac?  "A braggart".  Europeans? "idealistic Olympians who do not recognize the need for force".  And so on...  Now, I dislike Chirac myself. But a skilled author owes his readers some balance and, especially, more justifications.  The French do have a long and shameful history in Iraq.  Selling weapons.  Having their defence minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, refer to Saddam as "a new Napoleon" (which is praise, in France at least) after 1988.  Looking happily to the end of sanctions to sell more stuff in an area without US competition.  Given all that, France deserves criticism, but Mr. Keegan doesn't bother to argue his case by mentioning any of it.  The BBC also gets nailed for its "biased coverage", again without any arguments to support that position.  Personally, I rather liked their coverage and thought its bias less visible than Keegan's.  And, no, I don't think that hoping for a future without wars is silly.  It might not work out, and sometimes (Rwanda, Kosovo, Bosnia) it is better to go to war after all.  It is necessary to resist dictatorships such as Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, North Korea.  But you can't fault pacifism as being only for silly idealists.  It has, for now, all but stopped wars among Western nations and it has instilled a healthy distrust of "colonial interventions" by most of those nations' citizens.   Third - the war itself - Not all that great.  There is some high level analysis of what units were moving where, and what they did.  Some coverage of local action, plenty of other interesting stuff.  Keegan is in in element here.    What there isn't is any interviews of Iraqis.  Or any detailed info on Iraqi activity during the war. No Iraqi is mentioned by name outside the usual suspects covered by CNN.  Everything is from the Allies' viewpoint.  I don't blame Mr. Keegan for staying out of Iraq right now.  But it makes you wish that the book was written ten years from now, with Keegan having been able to do his usual world class research.  Nor is there any analysis of how the US should face the Iraq insurgency, despite the 2005 addition to the book.  With current events being what they are, we need people like Mr. Keegan to reinvent themselves as analysts of low-level, guerilla warfare, terrorism, etc...    But this book is more informative about the perils of writing history books too soon, before the facts emerge fully 
 There's nothing wrong with giving background on a subject, but Mr. Winchester abuses the privilege. There's no digression too minute, no reference too arcane, no place where one word can't be replaced with 100. When he does finally get to a set of pertinent points, the writing is excellent. That's what kept me from giving it a worse review. Too bad those excellent parts are as rare as cashews in a tub of economy-brand mixed nuts.   If you're prepared to work your way through the innumerable detractions and root out the nuggets, the book is worth your time. Otherwise, pass on it.  
 echoing the first reviewer...i must say that in all earnest dyson is certifiably...insane. what a moron. knocking cosby for his incisive and right-on comments trying to wake up the black community from its slumber? dumb 
 I was made to read this book in school, and found it impossibly dull and overly descriptive.  The plot is terribly perdictable, and slow paced.  I hated this book  and definitely recommend against reading i 
 It might be a nice little book if any of it were actually based in reality.  Yes, the author is right that if Hutton had challenged the dominant mode of thought to create a new science and been the first person to challenge the biblical time-scale and the story of the flood, that he should be mentioned in the same breath as Galileo, Newton, Darwin, and the other greats  ...BUT HE DIDN'T!  All of this had been already covered to varying degrees by many different scientists for only about oh, the last 100 years by the time Hutton showed up on the scene.  He is in no way a founder of geology, he is only an important and early contributor.  So regardless of whether the book is well written or not, the entire foundation for what it has to say is completely false, and thus completely worthless 
 I purchased these speakers about a year ago. If you'd like to know what your likely useable time is with these speakers feel free to use this example. I'm on Amazon right now buying replacements (ANOTHER BRAND) for these that have completely failed. They worked fine at first, then got fuzzier. One quit completely tonight, no power..nothing. The other still "works" with lots of fuzz. I find myself re-tuning the signal a lot. Time for a replacement. If you intent to use wireless speakers spend some extra bones and get a different brand. I'm trying the Acoustic Research AW-871s now. They supposedly have better range. Don't settle for cheap unless you have to. You'll probably be replacing them in a year if your patience lasts that long! Don't say we didn't warn you 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 congrats on your first victory in eight and a half decades 
  Ok now I am afraid to try any other Our Gang DVDs! No one mentions how poor the sound is, so that it it almost impossible to understand what is being said! This made this DVD worthless in my opinion 
 I used to love SB novels, but the last few have been so very disappointing and "Into the Storm" is, by far, the worst.  There is no character development so we don't understand why couples who are formed in the book would be attracted to each other.  Basically, they've known each other, at best, casually through work - they sleep together - having the most amazing sex ever! and they suddenly decide they care deeply about each other.  Hmmm, that may work at 17, but the characters are in their late 20s and early 30s.  They have very responsible, professional careers and by now, should know that love is based on far more than casual sex.    The situations SB keeps coming up with are becoming more and more amateurish and bizarre.  All of these factors caused me to quickly lose interest in the book and I began skimming pages hoping that something, somewhere would grab my attention.  No such luck.  I used to love reading SB novels.  I couldn't wait for new books to be published and I'd stay up late into the night reading.  No more.  In fact, I think I'm done with Brockmann.  Granted, I never read SB for the suspense.  I loved the character development, the character interaction and the adventure that made sense to the story.  If I want suspense, which appears to be where SB would rather go these days, I'd much rather spend my time and money reading Tess Gerritsen or Karin Slaughter.  They do suspense so much better 
 You will need deep pockets and a strong stomach for wipsaws inorder to succeed with a somewhat subjective method. It may be useful as a confirming directional tool, but so are simple moving averages. I was disappointed and found the method incompatible 
 The authors have an introductory statement:  " We assume you are smart, if not give this book to someone else..."  Well, I assumed the authors were smart and obviously I made a wrong assumption.  The book is absolutely the dumbest thing I have ever read.  I tossed my copy in the trash.  
 Is there an option for zero.  The worst I book I have ever read.  He contradicts himself in his points, hoovers over stealing pears (and other evil things) and puts me to sleep.  I don't see how this piece of garbage could make anyone a saint, it should be burned. ZERO STARS 
 Actually, this is more of a run-down on the basics of sound and synthesizers and nothing more, proclaiming itself to be "the ultimate reference for sound design".  For a more complete reference for ACTUAL sound design techniques to design SPECIFIC sounds, see either "Synthesizer Programming" or "Synthesizer Technique" in the Hal Leonard Keyboard series, or Snoman's "Dance Music Manual".  I rated it two stars because the knowledge in this book, while well compiled and presented, is easily accessible for free on the internet (try Sound on Sound's secrets of synthesis articles).  Also, you can learn these same things in Hal Leonard's Keyboard series directly from the legends of the field (i.e. Bob Moog) while also learning some tips in sound design. (see my review of Synthesizer Programming for more info).  To see why this is the case you just look at who the author is.  Jim Aikin was, among other things, a writer in Keyboard magazine about music technology - not a sound designer or musician.  Therefore, you can fully expect that in this book Mr. Aikin will write exactly what he knows about, music technology.  Since he does not actually use this technology to create music, it would be erroneous to assume that this book what be about how to use synthesis to create cool sounds and music (sound design).  To learn these topics, you must consult and author who is actually a musician, such as Snoman, or a real sound designer, as are those who wrote the articles in the Hal Leonard Keyboard compilations.  Understandably though, most sound designers will not divulge their trade secrets to us so such information will be sparse!   To conclude, you shouldn't buy this book if you have a clear understanding of synthesizers but want to learn some techniques in applying that knowledge.  You should, however, buy this book if you know absolutely nothing about synthesizers (how they produce sound), sound waves, or sound effects (chorus, reverb etc).      
 At the young age of 25 Julie Barenson loses her husband. Shortly after he dies, a great dane puppy is delivered to her home with a note from her late husband. This part will give you the chills ... nice touch.  She names him Singer, and despite her frustrations with his size and clumsy mannerisms they grow to love each other.   After a few years of trying to get her life back together after her tragic loss, Julie begins dating 2 men--Richard, a handsome charmer who wines & dines her, brings her lavish gifts and professes his undying love very early in the relationship. The other, Mike, is a simple down to earth country type whose idea of a date is a burger, Doritos & a couple beers at the local watering hole.  So who would you choose? Ouch! I'll stop there with the comment that this could have been such a compelling story.  Instead, we are faced with trite, boring, repetitive dialogue throughout, scatterings of viewpoint shifts and a very predictible plot.  I cannot believe this is the same author who wrote The Notebook, one of my all time favorite novels. I'll have to admit the ending brought on a gush of tears.  In conclusion, Singer not only saved his owner but the book as well. 
 I had read glowing reviews about this book and was very eager to begin reading it.  What a disappointment!  The heroine is uninspired, the writing is abysmal, and the plot never seems to move anywhere.  I love soap operas and couldn't wait for the "juicy" reveals about soaps that the book previews promised. Overall, I was incredibly bored by the novel.  Let me illustrate it this way.  I always read every page of every book before making up my mind about it.  With this one, I stopped about a fourth of the way.  Your time would be better spent watching an episode of "All My Children. 
 I was so happy with the first DVD I played - then the second and every next DVD would not load.  The player has never left my kitchen table - no chance for abuse.  I sure hope I can return it - it was expensice 
 This is my second book by Moore that I've read.  I have found him to be an alternative thinker.  He writes some great things criticizing the course of modern society however some of his positions on morals are just unthinkable for a former monk.  I agree with the reviewer who questions Moore's advice to the women whose husband was cheating on her.  I've found some good insights while digging through this earthy volume.    
 "This Is What You Want...This Is What You Get" was the weakest link in the shaky chain of PiL's output in the '80s. Vapid and pretentious, the album is not danceable, is not emotionally engaging, it doesn't rock, and basically stands for everything I thought John Lydon was against: overproduced ego-stroking. "Bad Life" and "The Order of Death" are the only stand-outs, which, in essence, makes the album a decent single. Stick with Second Issue or The Flowers of Romance for good PiL 
 This is a product of the lazy, latter-day Leonard who knows he's a great writer who can just sit back and let it flow. The onetime master of concision now takes a hundred-odd pages just to set things up.  Even his ear for dialogue has started to fade on him. Now everybody like, y'know, talks like, uhh, some kinda boob, get what I'm sayin'? The line of self-parody is lying a little too close in these pages.  He still has a hand with the quirky minor characters, though they can't carry an entire 350-page plus novel. But this one did make it clear to me why Leonard is so popular with the pomo crowd: his characters inhabit an utterly amoral universe, one with no values or standards whatsoever. Here, e.g., the protagonist is that well-known figure drawn from life, the friendly, easygoing loan shark. In your traditional crime novel--Chandler or either MacDonald can serve as examples--the action occurs against a hard-edged moral framework that is at least given lip service. Now I won't demand that every piece of fiction act as a morality play. But this was a case where I finished the thing, and kind of enjoyed the ride, but didn't like myself for it. In Leonard's recent novels, all that matters is who gets to take home the candy. And when you get right down to it, that just ain't enough. 
 I admit I am not an actor or an Olympia Dukakis fan but I was curious about this book. She drew me in by going for what most of us know her by--her Oscar for Moonstruck.  But the book was too vague in so many places she brushed over her family life with generalities like I was so busy.  She just says I got a role in this play but didn't say how she went about it, who she called, who she knew or who helped her.  I was disappointed in the ending and her experiences with the ashrams. Those experiences were the ones she really wanted to share to attempt to inspire other women. I enjoyed reading about her Greek heritage in the beginning of the book, much much more 
 I tested this along with the Neuros MPEG4 and must say hands down the winner in picture quality is the Neuros.  The picture with the SanDisk is very pixelated, especially with fast action sports like football and basketball.    The SanDisk does have a better interface, and is easier to understand and set up quickly, but in the end the picture and sound quality are poor.  FYI - I'm using a PSP as my viewer 
 Moen's book recounts an intriguing series of personal journeys undertaken during classes at the Monroe Institute (TMI). The classes there build on experiences by its founder Robert Monroe detailed a series of books written over a span of many years. In a sense the Moen chronicle (this is vol 3) picks up where Monroe leaves off using the same kind of annoying jargon. Fortunately there is a glossary to guide the reader. Many other authors have tried to capture the goings-on at Monroe, but Moen seems to have turned it into a career. If you are a current or prospective TMI student, these writings could be the ultimate guide (or puff-piece) to bring a new level of understanding. However, if you are the average reader thinking from the title that you are going to learn something more about the afterlife as depicted by books in the spiritualist tradition, forget it. Science fiction fans would probably find great enjoyment with the work. Moen is an effective writer who maintains a fast-paced description of his experiences, but the jargon-laden pages are a bit much to attract attention from a general audience. His fun-filled episodes with their never-ending sexual overtones are more reminiscent of a teen-ager at Disneyland than a metaphysical explorer pushing to new levels of understanding. The volume is a testament to Moen's amazing astral abilities and his mentoring of TMI students. If you would like a description that is an order of magnitude more useful try the "Life in the world Unseen" series from Anthony Borgia or free afterlife ebooks at spiritwritings.co 
 Although this text may be of assistance to some, it may also be used incorrectly and the criteria set forth in the DSM-IV-R is stringent, complete, and also complex.  Do not confuse this edition for the one you will need when working the psych ward or in higher education seeking a degree in a psych or psychiatric related field 
 This is the worst movie I've ever seen... Damn!!! I don't even want to listen to the soundtrack, there is no reason in losing time........... 
 "Internal Combustion" by Edwin Black is an entertaining but uneven history about the control of energy with a purported emphasis on the ascendancy of the gasoline-powered automobile. To his credit, Mr. Black has managed a substantive research project that has uncovered a great deal of arcane historic information about the automotive industry. Unfortunately, this preachy book suffers from an acute lack of focus, where it is suspected that the large amounts of extraneous background material was added in an attempt to obscure the book's shortcomings. Indeed, the author ultimately fails to prove his central thesis, thereby casting doubt about the validity of both his research and his conclusions.  Mr. Black opens the book with a scene depicting the burning of Thomas Edison's research laboratories in December, 1914. Mr. Black's conspiracy theory proposes that sinister forces aligned with the gasoline-burning automotive industry may have intentionally destroyed the world's one and only hope to mass-produce an electric car. Unfortunately, Mr. Black provides no evidence to prove this allegation.    Mr. Black attempts to buttress his case by explaining that electric vehicles were once utilized as taxis in New York and other major cities in the late nineteenth century and, therefore, could have and should have been mass marketed to an appreciative public. We are supposed to accept Mr. Black's thesis that success would have been an inevitable and logical outcome despite the severe weight, cost and range limitations of the electric car when compared with the gasoline automobile. In fact, while Thomas Edison and Henry Ford were still tinkering with an electric alternative a full thirteen years after gasoline-powered vehicles had already been in mass production, it is evident to the reader that internal combustion vehicles prevailed because they were affordable, the first to market and could traverse longer distances than electric cars. That all of this was not a good development for people's health and the environment is not in dispute; rather, it is Mr. Black's contention that the white-hatted purveyors of electric vehicles could have prevailed save for the obstructionism of the black-hatted petroleum industry that remains in question.    In the end, what is conspicuously lacking throughout the book is a credible attempt at analyzing and critiquing the history of governmental and popular struggle with the fossil-fuel industry. But instead of scholarship, we have a vainglorious author who is determined to salvage the barren results of two years' worth of study by substituting analysis with a highly questionable work of narrative. The end result is little more than a masquerade of nonfiction; at best, it is a book that might have limited appeal to readers who crave pseudo-historicism at the expense of intellectual rigor, consistency, insight or coherence. 
 The book is so basic - no details.  For example, you would think it would go into the details of insurance - what the difference is between bonding and liability insurance and advise you as to which you need, and where to go for this, and how much to expect it to cost.  Instead the book only says, "This Insurance is important protection" and will "offset the costs of major damages".  Same with Licenses.  It tells you that you need one - offers no advice as to how to go about getting one, if there are fees, etc. - zero details at all.  I was very disappointed in this book.  
 I'm a long time fan of "Wabi Sabi for artists and designers" and a new fan of "the Wabi Sabi House" so I thought this would be along the same lines.   Actually it seems to be a new age self-help book full of self obsessed California psycho-babble. If you are a lost soul needing support and guidance this may be a great book for you. If you are a designer or architect looking for guidance in bringing more authenticity, grit, and poetry to your creative process then pass this one by 
 I will admit that I too read this book cover-to-cover and was intrigued by its story. The problem is, I became so engaged that I began doing subsequent research into the field of remote viewing and, appropriately enough, began to "see the truth." Psychic Warrior is a highly fictionalized, exxagerated, self-serving vehicle for its disgraced author to exploit his fleeting brush with the RV program for money.  David Morehouse had the shortest tenure of any of the Army's remote viewers who have gone on to make a living as "experts" on the technique. According to those fellow viewers, most of the "exploits" in RV that Morehouse takes credit for in this book were actually accomplished by other people. The best example is his "Mars expedition," which was in fact conducted by Joe McMoneagle. An actual transcript of Joe's session is available as a bonus with purchase of Skip Atwater's book "Captain of My Ship, Master of My Soul" and it more or less proves that Morehouse is trying to take credit for someone else's work. The Psychic Warrior book is full of events and accomplishments that Morehouse tries to take credit for, most of which actually occured when Morehouse wasn't even in the program.  In fact, most of the revered remote viewers (McMoneagle, Ingo Swann, Russell Targ, Paul Smith) seem to consider Morehouse to be the RV community's "odd man out," especially after he was forced out of the Army for having an affair with his enlisted driver's wife among other things. That part of the book is even more suspect; Morehouse continually makes excuses for himself and tries to paint himself as a victim of some sort of government plot as a result of his threat to "expose the truth" about RV, instead of taking accountability for his illegal and immoral actions.  But two facts must be considered here: First, the Army itself declassified the program and released mountains of information about it; it is highly doubtful that they would make attempts on the lives of Morehouse's entire family over something they were already planning to open the lid on. Second, practically every other significant member of both the SRI program and the military's program has gone on to write books, author instructional materials and even teach courses in remote viewing, and not a single other one has been "targeted" by higher powers as Morehouse claims to have been.  If anyone out there is interested in reading about remote viewing and its history within both the civilian science sector and the military/government, I would highly recommend that you read Paul Smith's "Reading the Enemy's Mind" instead of Morehouse's fictionalized waste of time. Smith, who acted as unit historian for the Army's program, provides an infinitely more reliable, intelligent and engaging account of the development and implementation of remote viewing. And if you would then be inclined to study the technique yourself, I would suggest you examine Skip Atwater's course at the Monroe Institute in Virginia before plunking down the $1,000 + to study with Morehouse. After all, Atwater spent years training most of the viewers in a program that Morehouse was kicked out of after only a brief time.  I wouldn't have had such a problem with Psychic Warrior if it had been marketed as a work of fiction. It is a shame that such a perversion of the truth ends up being many people's initial introduction to something as significant to humankind as remote viewing. 
 When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.    I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate 
 For what purpose these lies about the life of this man? Are the liberal film makers racists who don't believe that there is a good black man to depict on film so they have to lie? If someone wanted to write fiction about a badass black fighter on the cusp of super stardom who is framed for a murder then be my guest. Hurricane carter is not and was not that man.  Facts: In the movie denzel washington is shown in military garb with more medals on his cheat than colin powell. They want to drive home the point that here was a man who served his country and is now about to be screwed by it. Fact is carter was kicked out of the army after being court mashalled 4 times!  In a title fight scence with an italian american fighter named giodello carter is depictied as beating this man pillar to post only to be screwed out of the decision he so richly deserved. Fact, giardello deserved to win that fight according to the overwhelming number of experts who have viewed it then and now on tape. The depitction is another lie.  Another lie is this notion put forth in the movie that hurricane was on the verge of getting that title before mean white bigots framed him for this murder. Fact is that carter's boxing career was going down hill and he had only won 8 of his last 15 fights. As carter's boxing career failed he became more militant in his political views and hated white people. While in prison he was diagnosed to be psychotic. Yeah a psychotic racist is the model for black america. Shame.  Norman jewison must not think much of black folks to make a movie of lies like this. Denzel washington should be ashamed he participated in such trash. Those who produced this trash bet that the average public would be gullible enough to believe these lies with no attempt at knowing the truth and hollywood didn't care; they just like the message. Looking at these reviews i have to say they made a good bet. America bashing and race baiting is alive and well, earning oscars and making for big box office. A shame.       
 I purchased this book with the intent on using it in my AP Literature class.  What a waste of $50.00!! 
 I never got this book though I ended up being refunded 
 Usually I skip over album reviews if they are too extreme (5 or 1 star).  But it's quite called for here.  CAN A MAN RAP WITH ANY LESS CHARISMA??!!    Cam's come quite a long ways, as evidenced by this album.  Average production.  Uninspired, generic rhyming schemes and also-ran content.  The production and engineering are fuzzy and lo-fi - and it's not on purpose.  An amateur job all around.  It would be nice if this was cut to 4 songs and labeled a demo tape.  There's definitely growing pains all throughout.  Skip to his later selection 
 The worst story is Kenyon !!! I will NOT buy any more in the future!! 
 This is the book we used in my first undergraduate course in topology. I remember it as being one of the worst textbooks I ever came across in my undergraduate math studies. The explanations were too short and many definitions were buried into the text. I remember constantly having to flip through the pages of this book to find something I was looking for. Stay away from this book 
 Unfortunatley, most of the songs are from the "B" side of their hits. There are some good tunes, but not enough familiar ones 
 This book is in a word, bad.  The explanations of the algorithms are decent in places but in some areas using the pseudo code provided you could not reproduce a working algorithm.  What data structure they are using is sometimes difficult to determine. They also use function calls they do not explain. When reading the book they are constantly referring back to things they talked about chapters ago just by giving an "Algorithm" or figure number.  But with the Lemma and definitions and Examples having similar numbers you will spend a lot of time looking for it, how hard would a page number be?  Over all I am not happy.  On the plus side the math review at the start of the book is decent and the book is not too wordy.    I have 4 books on algorithms and I still have not found one that I really like, a shame.  This book attempts to be a modern update to "The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms" -AHO | Hopcroft | Ullman.  An update of that book is not what students need.  They need a rethinking of how to present algorithms. We are still waiting on that book 
 if you like this book, more power to you. i wish you well. but, please: shame on the modern library editorial board for choosing this thing as the 8th greatest novel of the 20th century! ridiculous. there is nothing special about the writing, and the whole book is such a heavy-handed ideological sermon, that it is more like a dark dreary pondorous cartoon i wish i had taken no part of. if you like ugly literature, this will be for you.                 
 These are really, really youthful designs.  They are also strongly oriented towards the small-chested and lithely armed.  I flipped through this and found less than 10% of these are wearable for me-- a 35 year old packing about 20 extra pounds.  Straight back to Amazon with this book 
 Chuck has nothing to worry about here. While Drake has a great voice and a vivid imagination this book just ran out of steam. It probably would have worked better as a short story. I found Nita's self-imposed hardships to be quite grating after about 100 pages and there were still 200 pages of the same to go. It all got a bit repetitious and obvious after awhile. I also didn't find the book funny. I didn't laugh once. I have to add that I am in no way the sharpest tool in the shed but even I saw the ending coming a mile away. 
 Poor communication.  I was notified that the printer was not coming when they said it would, but was never given another date.  After waiting some time I cancelled the order and said I ordered another one from someone else.  I guess they don't read their email either.  The next day they shipped the item.  Now I have two, but am not going to spend another $20 to ship it back to them.  Believe me I would never buy from this company again 
 Yuk!!! Worst Book I've ever read - I read alot and with alot of variety. This book stinks (too farfetched, retched, disgusting and plain weird).  
 It's a pretty terrible book overall. It's more like "Dick and Jane Go Downtown." There is plenty of information here concerning the band but Bowman's arrested development writing style makes the sledding rather tough, and at other times, outright laughable. One example is the purported "mystery" concerning how many times Byrne sings 'fa fa fa fa fa fa' in Psycho Killer's recorded performances, live performances, and the six fa-fa-fas documented on the liner notes for Talking Heads '77. As Bowman writes, "The mystery may never be solved". So gobsmacked was I to learn this that I nearly spilled me Jameson's down me loonpants! It also doesn't appear that Bowman actually spoke to any band members for this book. Further, he wears his own literary inclinations on his sleeve: if I read one more likening of Tom Verlaine or Patti Smith to Beaudelaire or Rimbaud I'm going to puke. It's just a not very good book - it reads more like undergraduate hero worship than objective critique. The photographs included in the book are laughable in their triviality. Only the captions are worse. Save your money, this is a real dud 
 A tribute is defined as "a gift or other acknowledgement of gratitude, respect, or admiration."  That is what you have here. But, if you want a true picture of that incredible morning, don't waste your time and money, look elsewhere 
 It is amazing someone would spend so much time to translate a text like this only to not translate it in it's entirety.  I have seen this before with Conze's translations of Buddhist texts which are equally appalling.  This being a ancient religious text, it has repetition.  But it is there for a reason. One, often an important point is repeated so that you remember it.  Two, with Buddhist texts, many of them are meant to be a meditation, the repetition is part of that.  Third it is a poetic device.  But again when you buy a translation of a text don't you expect to get the WHOLE text and not have it edited at whim by the translator.  The Sutras are the equivalent of the Bible in Buddhism.  Wouldn't you think something is wrong if every time a translation of the Bible repeated itself (as the synoptic gospels do) that you just got a note instead of the actual text.  I can't believe Wisdom even published it, no one would publish a bible that way.  Worse still, Walshe doesn't note the majority of the items he leaves out but just gives you a ... to indicted he didn't feel the point was important enough to translate.  And these often come a point where it really interferes with the reading of the text.  I want my money back 
 It's healthy bear in mind, as Horgan urges, that neuroscience has yet to produce medical or technological breakthroughs on the scale of physics, chemistry, or other areas of biology (of which neuroscience is a subfield, btw); research programs in the field would do well to be more influenced by these priorities.  But as far as his grander, negative conclusions regarding the futility of neuroscience are concerned, the book is an unmitigated failure.  Indeed, the discussion of neuroscience is so thin and his arguments so specious that one suspects that Horgan is really quite content just to provide a set of Tom Cruise-style talking points for those who are already suspicious (or frightened) of the empirical study of mind.    Horgan's negative claims are not borne out by an honest look at the field.  For example, he professes not to be able to come up with a single solid discovery that neuroscience has made in its history.  Really?  What about the discovery of receptive fields by Kuffler and others, a fundamental fact about sensory and motor neural organization every student learns?  How about functional neural columns in V1 (Hubel & Wiesel) and elsewhere?  The neural correlate of eye movement commands in the superior colliculus (Wurtz, Goldberg et al.)?  And what exactly was the objection to Kandel's groundbreaking work on the molecular basis of memory supposed to be?  Rather, Horgan's methodology is to exploit the modesty and self-effacement of many neuroscientists, who will say `But of course we have no idea how X works' to temper the enthusiasm surrounding their discovery of Y.  But modesty (or jadedness) notwithstanding, no neuroscientist believes that the field has learned nothing important about the brain in the last 100 years, or that important questions haven't been answered definitively.  Horgan also offers a sort of argument from ignorance-if he and his colleagues at Scientific American can't get their heads around Goldman-Rakic's work in an afternoon, it must be beyond human comprehension altogether.  Other interpretations of the situation are possible.  In sum, a grossly misleading book 
 I sympathize with many of Searle's views about the inelliminability of the intentional character of consciousness, and the general misguidedness of philosophy of mind.. but I would ask: is this a big discovery? why read Searle rather than Husserl in the first place? Is his naturalism of any philosophical depth or interest? I would say no. I believe reading this book is a waste of time, as it was for me.. 
 The book never arrived--Instead I was sent (3 months later) a small paperback entitled "Helping Children Accept Themseves and Others" from Better World Books.  Perhaps Adam Smith would agree that this is the market at work but in the future "Better World Books" will not be my market 
 I received the package and read the instructions.  In retrospect there were hints buried there that indicated this may not go well.  It did not.  My installation stalled out and would not complete rendering the computer useless.  I had to take it to a professional to get it going.  Even so, I have had problems with Internet Explorer stopping suddenly, BSOD's.  This is not a job for the average computer user 
 Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book.  The book is put together by gathering some data mining concepts padded with tons of buzzwords to "teach" you about data mining.  It really fails to teach you anything and it really succeeds to confuse the hell out of the reader.  The language used on this book is the poorest I have ever seen in my entire life.  The people how wrote this book and the publishers who published it should be ashamed of themselves.  It is a shame that I had to pay for this piece of work because I have to read it for a course I am taking and I really dread opening it every week.  
 This small book is fun to read, but it's usefulness is limited mainly to painters. Not as good as "Art & Fear", which addresses the same material in a more general and insightful way 
 Yet another book that misses the point.   A Coworker had this book so I borrowed it.     Other reviews of this book write,   I rate this one as being the most detailed intellectually, ( there is that common word arrogant liberals like to use, "intellectually" )   1) Liberals also known as Progressives must restore their communion with the PUBLIC   ( "Communion"??  Interesting choice of a word.   Want to bet that this reviewer that wrote this never does nor believe in partaking in communion with God?  Oh lets have communion with the PUBLIC but not the God that made me?  Interesting. )   Deep in the book is the other bottom line: the Democratic Party has completely lost its mind and heart  ( "True that" lost its mind and heart. )      This is a very serious book, and it will help the intellectuals ( there is that word again ) among the left of center elite understand their failure, but this book is not going to win any points with the labor unions, the working poor, or the broader coalition of Independents, Reforms, Greens, Libertarians, and -- my own proclivity -- moderate Republicans.     (Why won't it help these groups understand?  Simple put, any one group, or better yet since everyone is an individual, that says war is bad but abortion for any reason that the woman chooses is OKAY, then you will always be confused and never understand.   And since we are not going "back to those "those days pre 1960's" ever, then you will never, or any generations coming, ever understand.      Now as you get ready to hit the "disagree" button and write me off as just another blah blah right winger "which I am not", and say "how can one be pro life and also be for wars?  As in trying to turn the tables back on me.      Its people like you that say Jesus was for peace and love. How there is no way a so called "true Christian" can claim to be a Christian and be for wars, when Jesus said over and over LOVE your neighbor as yourself.      AND Note Jesus also said love God more than anything else.    Ah, okay.   Interesting how some people will "believe" Jesus said some things, but not about some of the other things he said.      No, you either believe in everything he said, or none of it.   If someone is lying about something, then why believe in anything else you say?    What all this mean?    Jesus said,  When you hear of wars and revolutions, do not be frightened. These things must happen first, but the end will not come right away."    You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.    When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come.   " Operative words"   Do not be frightened  These things will happen "first"  The will not happen "right away"  Do not be "alarmed"   The end is "still to come"   HE was speaking all this for the times that are to be "after" his Crucifixion.    So is Jesus saying that war is OKAY, no, but he IS saying that it's going to happen, right?  But WE humans want war to be over and not happen, to lets all get along.     But Jesus was talking about it "back then" and does that not mean today to then?  If you believe in Mary, you believe in Jesus.  Or dont believe in any of it.  Free Will.   you cant have half.  picking and choosing what you want.   thats fantasy island.    Well then, you put yourself in the group that Jesus is not coming back, you deny the resurrection, you deny all of what Jesus said then, now you understand why you are confused and don't understand?   Feeling "intelligent now?"    How about trying to understand why so many centuries of war the world over, and especially in the middle east?   3 faiths, all fighting over "Who" Jesus is?    They are not fighting over Mohammad, the fighting is over "who" Mohammad said Jesus is  The Jews are fighting over that Jesus was not the Messiah  Christians are fighting over Jesus was the Messiah   Christians in the USA and the world over that argue and debate over denominations, are fighting over "who" Jesus said he is.    Now, is any of this "Okay" from either "group"?  No, but did Jesus say it was going to be "happening"    Yes he did.      When Jesus said,   Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.    Man will say, he was "A" way, not "the" way.     What did HE say?  HE said I am THE way, not A way.      Do not want to believe it?   That's okay; it's what you have and is known as a free will.   To each your own.     However, want to understand why all the problems today?  Well here you go so many fighting over "who" Jesus was and what he said.    Did he predict it?  Sure did.   Did he even challenge people even back then of "who do you say that I am"?   He sure did.    All the answers to the world's problems are pure and simple, but so many people don't want to "believe".     So hence, wars and stiff among people the world over shall continue.      According to Jesus, it will till he comes back again.   Believe it, or not.   But isn't it interesting that no one can name ONE century where there has been no wars.   Last century, the 20th, some 200 million people died of war related deaths.   The 20th century, our most advanced century of all time.   Our most "intelligent" and "educated" century of all time.    Yet, war continues.    Yet, so many say, we are getting better and more "intelligent" and more "educated", so we will some day eradicate wars.      Yea right, claiming to undermine what Jesus said.   Not going to happen.    Oh don't be so negative!   Glass half full or half empty!! Blah blah blah  It has nothing to DO with what I think, its Jesus SAID.    And "man", the world over, has blown it, and will continue to.     But "man" thinks he is intelligent and will overcome this world.       Not   "oh look, yet more reviews I found below,   "Good Fight" is quite possibly the best work of liberal intellectual history since Schlesinger's The Vital Center  (of liberal intellectual )   . If all you're interested in reading is another empty-minded polemic on the Iraq War  (Right, so many books on "emptiness", everyone trying to read this book and that book "trying" to figure all this out!   What IS going ON with people! )   So in continues.      I shall continue to read and watch you all.     This is better than Sports.         
 Clifford is a journalist and he personalizes issues and focuses on details that don't illustrate as much as they trivalize. He wants this to be a book about the ski industry but it is really about Vail with anecdotes about other players thrown in if Clifford thinks they are juicy. He defines the golden years of skiing to be that time when he was in his mid-twenties. He wants to get rid of the big corporations to return to that period. He wants to blame the financial markets for all of the enviornmental and social issues of the rocky mountains. I kind of doubt if ski towns were ever as idyllic as has he would like to remember them. Co-ops and non-public companies can be  just as short-sighted and just as rapacious as public ones.  And even if the resorts drive the economy there are a few other trends and relationships that deserve some blame. The Latino racism / exploitation thing that Clifford describes is less of an issue in California than it is in Colorado, and I  don't think it applies at all in the Northeast or British Colombia. (Somebody obviously washes the dishes and makes up the beds in those resorts, but the issue of undocumented aliens may be a local one.) The water for snowmaking issue is not relevant in BC (or even at Mamoth with their coastal weather patterns) - and I suspect that Hal has glossed over the nuances between the Northeastern resorts (mainly on private land with lots of snowmaking necessary for operation) and the front-range areas (mainly public land and snowmaking  necessary mainly to extend the season.) Water rights have been a contentious issue in the West as long as there have been competing users and at least the snowpack gives up it's runoff in the spring. The top end resorts are clearly not about skiing - duh - but that only applies to the developments in the highest rung and doesn't provide much insight into the industry as a whole.  If you're going to bring up Pellican Butte (which is irrelevant to any of  the organizations he addresses) why not talk about Early Winters where the community - or possibly the outside environmentalists - prevailed? If you're going to talk about Silverton Mountain why not talk about all of the lost ski areas in the same range? There are some interesting debates inherent in this issue - conservation vs. recreation, tourism as an extractive industry, regulation of development, commodification of leisure, - etc. But the resort is not the sport and it isn't even the community and when Clifford wants to blame everything on the impersonal corporate bad guy he ends up sounding like another anti-globalization [supporter] 
 I usually enjoy her books but this one was truly disappointing. Such a silly plot. I finished it but kept saying to myself..."Why not just toss this one?" 
 I've purchased the original PCM encoded CD more than once because I enjoy this album so much.  I was happy to see this album release in surround sound but was disappointed by the lack of content and very disappointed with the fact that I still can't figure out how to fast-forward through songs on the 5.1 side of the disc.  Why would you disable that option?  I guess the people who made the disc had a lot of extra time on their hands from not having to add extra content to the CD.  The recording label obviously wants the quick income of reselling this album without having to put any effort into remixing it or adding content 
 I'am unable to get this message to anyone.  This is the second book I orderd and both books are bad.  This one starting on disc #4 all is bad. I sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure but no one has contacted me.  I had the same problem on Vanishing Point, the cd left will not play on my player.  I will not order another book from You. Once I can see this happen, but twice is unacceptable 
 Like other reviewers listed here, I thought this book would focus on the trials and tribulations of cooking recipes that are half-a-century old (if not older)using pithy, witty humor and comparisons of the writer's life and Child's life.  To be fair, there is some of this sprinkled throughout the book, but as an avid cook and Child fan I wish there had been more.  I think there is a market today for food writing; good food writing, like MFK Fisher and Elizabeth David, but I don't think Julie Powell even comes close.  The Julie/Julia Project is a front for this young novelist who see-saws between charming and extremely annoying in her attempts to describe how her life evolves over a one-year period in which she participated (to whatever extent) in some very profound experiences, like working for the government agency dealing with the World Trade Center memorials, a household move in NYC, dealing with a less than stellar marraige, and coping with very needy friends and family.  Julie, get a get a grip on your neurosis and narcissism and just write!  Forget the food, it's just not you.  Stick to your hoo-hum job, your even more narcissistic friends, and your boring marraige and you could be the next Nora Ephron, or at the very least, Erma Bombeck. 
 I read Pest Control and absolutly loved it - it is the type of book you can denfinately see being made into a movie.  However, I found The Organ Grinders very difficult to read.  Much as I appreciate how Fitzhugh is trying to make us see some of the ills of the modern world (very commendable!) but I just found it heavy going.  In fact I'm only three quarters of the way through and it's taken four weeks to read this far (I normally finish a book within a week).  I could quite happily put the book on the shelf and forget about it; the only thing keeping me reading it is the fact I don't want to waste the time I've already invested. Sorry if I sound scathing, Just disappointed, Pest Control is brill, Maybe I should shelf The organ Grinders and read that again 
 I received this as a gift a year ago and I like the coffee maker part, the coffee comes out with a good flavor albeit a bit cold but it seems all coffee makers these days make the coffee a little cold. Once you mix in milk or 1/2 and 1/2 it is only lukewarm. The removable tank is nice (you can wash it) but awkward to use if you have the unit under a cabinet. Also the unit has a big footprint so that may be of consideration if your counterspace is limited.   I used to have a Delonghi pump-driven espresso machine that worked great. This one has a steam driven espresso that most coffee connoisseurs will advise against. I now know why. The pressure builds inside the water tank as the espresso brews and after 1/2 a shot the machine just shoots out steam. I've tried different grinds and tamping the coffee really hard (you have to buy a tamper with this one) it still builds too much pressure and it shoots out bitter coffee flavored steam after a short while. Also the markings on the pots peel off pretty quick. Not worth the money unless you get it for cheap on ebay. 
 I was under the impression that this was a literary magazine that would be full of fiction, short stories, essays, book reviews, and literary criticism. Instead I received a magazine that discusses political issues. Does the magazine know what it wants to be? They recently released a special fiction issue on the newsstands. Why would they if they're becoming a political magazine?  Do they want to be a news/political magazines such as Time, U.S. News & World Report, and Newsweek or do they want to be a literary magazine?   They're doing a poor job of establishing themselves and drawing the line of what they want to be. I regret subscribing because I felt mislead. Of course for The Atlantic staff, turning the magazine into a political direction will probably bring them more sales. I don't think that reading and literary magazines are dead by any means but the format needs to be revamped so that people will want to read it. 
 Page 328: "... For example, out of a worldwide total of $9 trillion in international bank loans and deposits in 2001, only about $700 billion went to poor countries-less than one percent. Out of $12 trillion in international investment securities, only about $600 billion went to poor countries, an even smaller fraction of one percent. ..."  I really enjoyed this book until I read this passage, now I'm doubting everything I've ever learned about math 
 Adults would never choose to read this garbage. It would be seen as masochistic [...] and too depressing to bother with. Raise an animal, get attached to it, but the reality of farm life is that if it can't successfully breed, you personally will have to butcher it. Heck, why should your dad do it for you, when we can reinforce that valuable childhood lesson of "Life sucks and then you die"?  What is the real point of this book? Do teachers everywhere get a vicarious thrill at the horror kids must experience when reading this stuff? My kid asked me to read it aloud to him when he couldn't take it anymore, and I got to the point where I hurled it across the room. Between this and all the other depressing books we make kids read, are we surprised when they are cynical goths?  AVOID THIS BOOK, if you love your kids 
 I made it through the introduction and most of the first chapter of this book.  By that time I had smoke coming out of my ears and my blood pressure had gone way up.  This woman managed to trash working women, ethnic groups, women who choose not to have children, and women who, because of economics, have to work.  But when she said that children of working mothers always turn out bad I had to quit reading.  She managed to quote that old standby that working women were "taking jobs away from men".  And she brought up the person that she sees as a purveyor of evil, Hillary Clinton.  She should read Proverbs 31:10-31 
 A friend loaned me her VHS copy of this movie, which I loved - - as much of it as I could understand.  When actors speak too fast, or don't move their mouths with some of their lines, or lower their voices to a whisper, I don't understand the words.  I need English sub-titles, which this movie doesn't offer on DVD.  So I am not buying it.  (Producers, take note!)  Producers of DVDs should understand that there are many types of folks out here who profit greatly by having sub-titles available.  My DVD player can't handle "closed captioning" for the hard of hearing, and I'm sure there are others that can't as well.  A friend half my age graciously clicked on the sub-titles when I visited her to view a film, & afterwards, she said, "My goodness!  I caught things I hadn't heard before!"  And she has perfect hearing!  There must be many people out there who refrain from buying a DVD because they can't see the dialog printed on-screen.  There are several movies I would have loved to have, but have not purchased for this reason.  Knowing what's going on makes for greater enjoyment 
 Written in cartoon format, I thought this book would be a lighter approach to a straight, dry, biography of scientists.  However, it is written more like a series of political cartoons than cartoons for kids.  The cartoons are barely understandable if the biography of the scientist is not already known, so using it as an initial reading is impossible.  Further, some content is offensive.  On the second page of cartoons, a scientist is walking along a bridge, thinking, when someone mistakenly believes he is getting ready to jump, saying, "No woman is worth committing suicide over."  The pictures show a scantily-clad woman (with bare bottom in one frame) that he is now picturing in his mind.  Irrelevant and inappropriate!  Plus, I didn't have to go far to find swear words in the captions.  Yikes!  My kids will never see this book!  It is not even appropriate for high-school age kids.  (In fact, it isn't even funny to adults! 
 The movie wasn't thrilling nor suspenseful. I felt as if something was missing. However, it was kinda interesting and the end wasn't bad.  It is a truly masochistic film.  The characters were colorful. The acting was good and believable.   Rating: Children should not see this film (nudity, drugs, violence galore, sex, & murder).   If you like watching violence with no motive, a crazy murderous family on kiling sprees and how they live, then watch it.  The characters were definitely interesting and unusual and that kept me interested enough to watch the film. This family is totally deranged, masochistic and sociopathic but they stick together through thick & thin. You never know what or who they'll do next, and this is why the film is so interesting 
 After reading several reviews, I only read one that was negative. I concurred that perhaps one person just had different needs.  Well, as soon as I opened the package I realized just how right the negative review was.  This book stand would hold up a children's soft cover back.  Any of my school books are not stably supported.    I would actually have to hold up the sides of the book to read the pages.  Unless you have thinner hard back textbooks (the hard back will support the pages), this is not worth buying (especially not for $20.00).  Make sure you realize just how small this bookstand is. If that is with you need, then this is the one for you.  
 Installed it at the kitchen sink, it lasted maybe two weeks.  Bought new batteries, light would not shut off after water had been turned on and batteries ran out again.  Save your money 
 I was looking forward to reading this book (as a former trackie). Unfortunately, the "interviews" appear to be unedited, with repetition and typo's abounding. Very little coherent material. 
 The essays were moderately amusing, but not a good use of my time. If you want short amusing essays, go for something like Gig or I Thought My Father Was God instead.  The advice given is often too general or too pointless to be useful (e.g., To Keep Warm -- eat right, keep your body in shape, have the right equipment; To Conduct a Background Investigation -- hire a private detective).  Maybe two of the essays were valuable if you really don't know how to tie a Winsor knot or a bow tie, but this isn't really the best way to find out because you'll never remember that the information is here and that's what the internet is for anyway 
 This is my first Ludlum book and it is sure to be my last.  The plot is preposterous because of Ludlum's limited understanding of economics and history.  Once you realize that, all interest in the story falls away.  It starts off plausible enough...and the blurbs on the jacket imply some "weapon" more powerful than a mere 270 million dollars!  Hitler gained power because of the alignment of a number of situations that made the ground fertile for his brand of megalomania.  Some spoiled, rich American brat and his fortune would hardly make a difference to the currents of history.  I know that this is only supposed to be a work of fiction, and it is all in good fun, but the plot-concept needs to be much more believable to hold my interest.  If you don't need logic in your fiction, it's interesting enough as a cloak and dagger story, but it falls far short in the historical (and economic) fiction department 
 This book is very confusing to read. When and where in history did something like this take place? Who is she talking about? I know it is a book of fiction, but is there any historical fact in it? One of the reviews  inside the book says "The beauty and complexity that existed 6000  years ago", and "Mackey joins the company of Jean Auel and  Elizabeth Marshall Thomas"!!! Unlike Mrs. Mackey, Auel and Thomas  research their books and set them in a real time in history. That is what  good Historical Fiction is all about 
 I work for a book summary company.  One of the books selected for summary is this book.  When you have the world famous author who made the startling expose on the Watergate scandal and Assistant Managing Editor of Washington Post, write about the eventful hours following the 9/11 attack at the World Trade Center, your expectations are naturally very high.  But Woodward lets you down, as this book leans heavily on transcripts of National Security Council meetings and extended interviews including over 4 hours of interview with George Bush, to reveal the layers of decision making process that followed the cataclysmic incident.  By providing the details of the close-door meetings amongst the key central players, we do get to size up partially on the personality of those involved.  We are privy to the arguments and ideological differences amongst the principal leaders as President Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld, CIA Director George Tenet, and Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, forcefully put their weight and power behind their viewpoints and decisions.  We are treated to how the CIA successfully waged an intelligence war against Afghanistan leading to the fall of the Taliban.  Beyond that we get precious little in terms of clear opinion on the dynamics of the decision making or the wisdom behind it.  A mere reportage of the collection of meetings and interviews are best served in a newspaper, and thus could ideally have found its way into Washington Post.  In the publication of a book, we expect a renowned media investigator as Woodward to undertake a more serious study such as on policy matters or the depth of leadership involved or an incisive analysis of personalities and so forth.  This is a rather tame book and hardly adds anything of great value, and much less so to the trailblazing work that Woodward is capable of.  
 The book is fine, except I had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer.  She's such a boring character.  She's young, but not motivated to work.  In fact, she quited one of her jobs when Macon covered her rent.  The dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men, and get support.  The point is that she doesn't enjoy the job, thus, a detailed description of her dog training job (which she doesn't seem to enjoy) was just a boring digression 
 The author of this book teaches the reader to talk down to their sub-conscious and treat it with disrespect. His advice tells the reader to treat the subconcious as a child.  A healthy individual makes friends with his/her subconcious. They become partners. They do not "beat up" their subconcious like the author teaches. Treating your subconcious with such disrespect as this book recommends is harmful . How can you love yourself if you disrespect a large part of yourself (the subconcious)?  
 Really less than one star!  Please people, don't buy any more videos.  Take your kids to the park, on a walk, read with them, play in the bathtub with them, anything.  Talk to them and enjoy them and they will talk back.  No more silly Baby Einstiens and the rest.  How about crayons, and side walk chalk, and blocks. Just be with your kids.  Give them your full attention when you are there.  You don't need these viedeos and "smart" products 
 While i am sure that real metalheads dig this album, I found it pretty lame. There is no creativity in the songwritting, the production is not happening, and the music isn't hard enough. 
 dO not order MENtle floss Magazin.  it preetends to be sMart but It's just a teaz.  Covers intersting toppics, aks good qestions but the ansers are lackng.  Each issu has half a page of corections frm the preevius issu.  whats the point of reeding a mag whitch promises to mak you smarter if its not so clevver itself?  Like ths revue, it dosn't live upto it's claims.  
 I'd purchased this biography to learn more about a fascinating woman who left an indelible mark on her profession, acting.  But my disappointment was great; this is less a biography than an infatuated paean -- something one might write for a fan club or public relations campaign.  Though Mr. Spoto and his crew of researchers obviously undertook considerable investigation into Bergman's life, Mr. Spoto failed to complete the last -- and most important -- task of a biographer:  a critical analysis of his subject.  Instead, throughout the book, Mr. Spoto repeatedly (and I emphasize "repeatedly") flogs readers with superlatives about Bergman's acting, looks, intelligence, strength, spirit, wisdom, and character.  Why the Pope hasn't yet canonized this woman, based on Mr. Spoto's writings, is beyond me -- perhaps it is only because she was not Catholic.  I do hope that someday another biographer -- say, someone with the talents of Edward Tytell (biographer of Ezra Pound) or Noel Riley Fitch (biographer of Sylvia Beach and Julia Child) -- might undertake the task of penning a more informative, insightful biography of Bergman.  The woman certainly deserves this.  
 Tripe by the bagfull. Sounds are good however there is little mystery to the lyrics. TISM are far better at taking the p..s out of society and rockstar culture. The english are good at this most of the time but this one is undercooked unless you are 14. The subjects are as basic as going to the toilet in your pants. I almost believe these guys believe themselves to be worth the money and that right there eliminates the back and fowrd cool or too cool warble. Could use some mid-range on the guitars also we don't need any more treble and dico beats. HAHA. Relax don't do it......... 
 Sometime ago I read my Sunday paper and noted that "Three Junes" was listed as a popular book choice.  The title sounded interesting so I bought it.  That was 2 months ago and I am still trying to get through the paperback edition.  It is difficult to follow the timeline, to understand the characters and where they fit, and to get involved in the storyline.  I will finish the book because that's my style.  It has not been a book that I could not wait to get back to. 
 Gloom and doom with a left wing slant.  Peak oil is real but this guy is extrapolating many trends to arrive at his version of a gloomy future.  The sky is falling, the sky is falling 
 I don't usually review music on Amazon as it is clearly such a matter of taste, but since I am (maybe "was") a huge Norah fan I pre-ordered this just assuming I would love.  I did not.  After three attempts to listen to it this CD has been put in a cabinet and forgotten.  The Little Willies CD was great, so if you haven't heard that and are dying for some good Norah give that a try.  This was just "ugggh" 
 At first I didn't realize that you have to use Amazon's software to load onto the Zen.  Once I figured that out (actually my husband figured that out) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do.  I wasn't able to edit the stars.  If I could I would give this 5 stars.  If you have tried some other sites for the Zen, they are much more difficult to use. Amazon's Unbox is great for the Zen 
 If you want to see Matthew Bourne's choreography, your in for a major disappointment. The constant pseudo-artsy cutting, jarring close-ups, and poor shots of the dancing make this a jarring and extremely disappointing video. Be warned if you have epilepsy. The fast continuous scene switching will probably induce an episode 
 At every turn when I took this book to hawaii I found mistakes in the text, places out of business or not such address. I wasted a lot of time following advice from this book I will never trust a Frommer Guide again. Look elsewhere 
 Who is writing these other reviews? This book was put together in a weekend. He has no passion for this variation, and really only selected some games, looked up the variations in some other books, and added some comments.  There is no research above and beyond, too bad king, I thought you were better than the eric schillers 
 I originally purchased this book for a graduate-level computer vision course.  I found the book more obfuscating than helpful.  For example, Trucco and Verri's discussion of PCA/SVD, a topic I know quite a bit about, left me confused and frustrated.  Unfortunately, their treatment of other topics is not any better.  I have since used the book as a reference on a couple occasions.  My opinion of the book has been raised only slightly since my first read, taking my rating all the way up to two stars ;).  I suggest that you DO NOT waste your money on this book 
 I've read about 20 of Laymon's novels, and they were always at least entertaining. But this book goes so far into the ridiculous, that it didn't even pass as entertainment. The characters are just too stupid to believe. At one point the main heroine (a 25 y/o school teacher) is nearly raped, and runs into a fast food bathroom instead of calling the cops because she's embarrassed to tell anyone her boyfriend has gone missing when he went out to buy condoms. No kidding. There's another scene were two teenage boys find what they believe is a dead woman's body, and instead of calling the police have a ten minute debate over whether to call for help or rape the dead body. This might be mildly amusing if it were meant to be over the top tongue in cheek horror, but Laymon's playing this straight. Not only the worst of his books, but one of the worst books I've ever endured. 
 Legend, Lies & Cherished Myths of American history is a misleading title.  Do not assume this book to among likes of James Lowen's publications.  Some aspects of the book seem factual.  However, many arguements he makes such as the American revolution was not revolutionary at all, are completly rediculous.  This is yet another book in this kind of genre based upon assumptions and poor research. Avoid it at all costs.    Brian DeDentro (Rhode Island College 
 The book Gemba-Kaizen is somewhat disappointing if you have read the book 'Kaizen' already. It gives not much new information. The only new idea in  the book is the attention given to the 'Gemba', the place where the  processes are performed. Imai is right to stress the importance of the  Gemba for operational excellence and he gives some nice tools and examples  to illustrate the Gemba's importance. However, only one nice idea is  somewhat poor to fill a whole book. The major message of the book can be  told just as well in an articel of no more then 4 pages 
 Thinking that the source material for Animal House the movie (which I thought was incredibly funny) might be even better in print, I picked up this book looking for the kind of laughs one gets from the best comic writing: Wodehouse, National Lampoon's cast of writers, Buckley, take your pick.  Unfortunately the actual experience of struggling through the cardboard characters, ludicrous set pieces and leaden plotting in this book was just like living through a hangover after a bad drinking binge: will it ever end?    How many times can you read about beer overdoses and puking and still consider it humorous?  Sure, most people who went to college had outrageous experiences; unlike those in this lame memoir, some of them were probably funny.  If you want a laugh, ask them to tell 'em to you again.  Better yet, just watch the movie one more time.  But consider this book the equivalent of a cup of stale beer with a garnish of cigarette butt 
 Three baby owls awake one night to find their mother gone. Alone in the dark and understandably frightened, the older babies discuss where she may be while the youngest cries, "I want my mommy!"  Mom owl finally appears and assures her babies that she will always come back. Although this book addresses a common concept familiar to toddlers and pre-schoolers-Will Mommy come back if she leaves?-I have to say that it should have remained a picture book. Although the black ink and watercolor crosshatched illustrations on a black background are very realistic, they set an ominous tone that, in tandem with the plot, I am not certain should be introduced to very young children; at least not introduced before bed time.. 
 The Deni 6000 works good for only a few weeks before it fails dangerously. I have 2 units that did the exact same thing. One of the rotating blades breaks off and comes out with the ice. Fortunately for me I noticed it in my glass before eating it. Two units-identical failures. This machine is a potential safety hazzard. I will be contacting Deni about their defective design. If you use this ice crusher and it starts sounding louder than usual, one of your blades is probably bent and about to break off. Beware 
  This volume, which has been around unchanged for at least 25 years, has a little useful theory and some diagrams of factory guitar wiring, most of which have fallen into obscurity as people keep going back to Strat, Tele, Les Paul styles. It is not terribly well written and while the most popular classic circuits are there, you can get those everywhere, including online for free.    If you want to learn to configure electric guitars to achieve goals you want, there are better choices, such as Adrian Legg's book, although it is more a list of things Legg has done rather than a thorough theory book. If you want to have easy access to useful documentation for service purposes, several volumes of wiring diagrams are available from Stewart-McDonald and other guitar vendors. Either way, this book isn't what you want. It should have been retired two decades ago 
 You see the name Andrew Lloyd Webber and assume it can't be horrible right? WRONG! When I put this CD into my player I was horrified. Some of the music was ok, but most of it was awful and cheesy. The London cast putting on southern accents are really bad. The lead character Swallow, has a voice made for a high school production, but not a soundtrack like this. This is not typical ALW, Musical Theater, or good music. This is good milk gone sour. I do however like the voice of the character Amos (pronounced in this CD as AY-MOSS) which is why my favorite song is "Tire Tracks and Broken Hearts" I suggest this for collectors, and ALW fans, but don't expect the normal, this is a new rock-christian ALW.

 and not in a good way; in the BS philosophy way. This movie tries to delve into new activism and the circle of political life, but it goes nowhere and explains nothing. One could say that perhaps the theme of the movie is futility. OK, fair enough, but maybe rearranging furniture is not the best course of action for political and social revolution. Just a thought. Stay away unless you are majoring in liberal arts. 
 This is a novel in superlative style: 'heroic, magnanimous, exalted, brightly, caressingly, exquisite, fascinating, wonderful, sublime, radiant, delightful ...' It confronts and mingles very superficially two impoverished Europeans with members of a wealthy Boston bourgeoisie family in a play of misunderstood sentiments and love. There is absolutely not a shade of a discussion of the social/mental difference between Europe and the US at the end of the 19th century. This book doesn't 'say nothing' (Thomas Hardy, quoted in the introduction), but nearly nothing. It hardly surpasses the level of a three-penny stationary novel, compared with the works of a Dostoevsky or a Flaubert. It is terribly sentimental and the tears flow easily.  Only for Henry James fans 
 After seeing Reba rip the Dixie Chicks on the awards show tonight, F U R M is all that needs to be said.  She's a no-talent, fugly, brain-dead hillbilly who should be working in a convenience store somewhere instead of being given a platform to take shots at real musicians who aren't even in the room.  Go back to the Ozarks RM.  We won't miss you at all 
   Just because some folks don't resemble human two-leggers and only have a hickory nut for a head doesn't mean they aren't real people all the same! Miss Hickory, a doll-like plaything belonging to Ann of the Old Place, maintains her dignity and self-respect during a long New Hampshire Winter. Shocked by the news that the Brown family has moved to Boston until late Spring, Miss Hickory relies on her woodland companions and her own ingenuity to survive without her corncob house.     The relations between Miss Hickory and Crow, Squirrel, Groundhog, a cat named Mr. T., Hen Pheasant and Robin provide light reading for children of a simpler era with its gentle pleasures and few dangers.  Underlying themes include the value of friendship and relaizing when not to be hardheaded.  Prim and resourceful Miss Hickory learns to recognize her own shortcomings and to trust to trust her friends, as she seeks to make a new life in the apple orchard.  This charming story offers literary safety in our modern age with its myriad threats to childhood innocence.  
 Free trade is great when you're rich and powerful enough to ram it down the throat of other nations.  The multinationals, who benefit from massive subsidies (aeronautics, computers, metallurgy, you name it) are more than happy to have members of the bought priesthood of academia distill  fantasies about the joys of the alleged "free market."  Not a  word in this book about the public subsidies that become private profits,  with a huge military and growing prison-industrial-complex for the millions  of people who are superfluous to the plans being made (undemocratically, of  course) in Geneva and Bonn.  Corporate tyranny and its servants are  destroying the environment, labor protections, the public sphere, and  cultural diversity.  Goebbels would be impressed 
 Let's see, besides our protagonist being a nominal Milton scholar (though like all the other literary lights cited in this book, there is no real connexion with any of Milton's works in this book), we have the following names dropped, seemingly gratuitously throughout this opus: James Joyce (5 times), Yeats (5 times), Thoreau (3 times), Bertrand Russell (2 times), Ezra Pound (2 times), Wordsworth, Emily Dickinson (at least 3), Matthew Arnold, Jack London....and I stopped counting after that.  Come now, does anyone save a literary groupie really appreciate all this display of superficial literary knowledge? Is it really intrinsic to the story? ---Here: My favourite example of the inanity of these quasi-literary speculations by Ray-" `The drop that wrestles in the sea/Forgets her own locality' was from Emily Dickinson, a poet he hadn't read attentively enough, since clearly she had something to say to him.".....And, well, what is it?  Never mind, no time for serious pondering.  It's on to more Yeats among others before the paragraph ends (p.351).  - The one exception to all this name dropping is Ray's recital of Matthew Arnold's "Dover Beach." to Morel.  But, as is commonplace, the exception proves the rule here. - I could go on about how disappointing the meretricious scholarship is in this work: Is Morel serious about citing Matthew 15:24 as proof that Jesus came only for the Jews?  Is Rush?  Anyone who has read the whole chapter knows that this is where Jesus turns to the Gentiles and heals the Canaanite's daughter because the Jews have rejected him.  Is Rush trying to show that Morel's idealism about a non-Christian Africa is superficial and misplaced?  Or is Rush simply showboating himself---I very much fear that it's the latter.  2 Stars for the few poignant passages on conjugal love.  But, in the end, I would have come away much more enriched had I spent the time reading actual literature: Joyce, Yeats, Wordsworth, Dickinson........Milton 
 I recently purchased this book on Amazon and dug in. The technology does not get in the way of the message and the author has a light humor which makes the learing process go faster. Incidentally, I had a question so I left an email for the author, and got a personal response the next day, clearing up my question. I recomend this book and other titles written by this person 
 I get the story line but 5 grown women need to suicide!?  The one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night.  Why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself!?!?  It is not matching the character 
 This book is very poorly written.  There are many typographical errors throughout the book and many, many inaccuracies in the content.  Some terms are used incorrectly and instead of assisting the reader in learning civil litigation, it creates confustion and frustration.  I would not recommend this book to anyone - especially students.  I hope the new edition is worth the paper it's written on 
 This is the first time I delved into the HellRaiser series, and I have to admit, I kind of regret it. The film opens with a collage of disturbing images, I guess to get my attention, but there is no real reason for them to be there. From there the film falls into a freefall where it jumps from one messed up scene to the next. It all looks perfectly twisted, but who really cares. Clive Barker, as he did in "Night Breed," shows his taste for creative costumes and set designs. Of course they are all very self-indulgent, but beautiful nonetheless in their own little way. Had this film showed up at a modern art museum I would have labeled it pretentious. But since it showed up in movie theaters I have no choice but to label it crap.  I would love to describe the plot to you, but it didn't make a ton of sense to me. Kirsty (Ashley Laurence) is in a mental hospital and is convinced that her dad is calling out to her from inside hell, and thus she must go save him. Meanwhile her evil step-mom (and speaking from experience they are all evil) is reemerging from hell with the distinct disadvantage of not having any skin. Upon her return she uses her bloody pulp of a body to engage in a sexual act with another evil doer. I'm sure that gets laughs every time from the children who are watching, but to me it was silly and unnecessary. She goes on a quest for skin which goes off without a hitch, and from there a battle ensues between Kirsty and her step-mom over the soul of a little girl named Tiffany (or so everybody calls her). The whole point seems to be that our minds make up our own personal hells, and that is an idea I can get on board with. One overview shot of hell has it looking strikingly similar to an M.C. Escher print. With dead ends and trap doors and boogeymen we all travel through the labyrinth of our mind on a daily basis. But I cannot get on board with this film. It is sensational for the sake of sensationalism, which is fine with me, but not when it is mixed with a brain dead plot. What do I, or anybody for that matter, get from watching a man carve himself up with a knife? I guess that at least it is not soft like modern horror movies, but this one does not earn its gore.  For those of you who demand nothing out of your movies other than the experience of a bad dream where nothing makes sense then this is your film. For the rest of you this is failed storytelling of the highest degree. I still have "HellRaiser" on my shelf to watch and I must say it won't be hard for that one to top this mess. I may never understand why people think atmosphere is enough to create a scary movie. It is the major flaw of this film and Japanese Horror in general, but I want a story to go with my scares. What this one is selling is a chance to be grossed out of your mind or bored stiff. . .or both. I hated this movie, and no I don't care how realistic it looked when the characters were peeling the skin off of their faces. *1/2 
 I have been trading futures for about 3 years, and wanting to learn more about spread trading. This book is very dry reading, and difficult for a beginner to go through. No color graphs. Just boring tables with numbers, and many words. Not an easy book for a visual learner. Seasonality is hinted upon, but no good charts provided, and he does not really tell you when to do what, or what triggers or conditions to look for to enter a position. His section on spread options trading is perhaps easier to grasp, and I did learn a bit from that. A more advanced trader might perhaps glean more from this book than I did, but I do not recommend it for the beginner 
 This book was extremely short, relying on large type and large margins to fill the book. It was devoid of any real plot and left me with a bitter taste. It was typical of "Oprah Book Club" books in that it is very depressing. I think this could have been a great book had the author expanded on the topics and built out the characters more fully. You did get a sense of the main character, but with such a short book, the rest were very weak.   
 I ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie. There's there's zero stretch in this, it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big. Since they're short from crotch to waist anyway, it doesn't much matter.  The top fits better, since you adjust it. The cut is still quite poor and, again, there's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders. It's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust. It's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem.  If you're narrow through the hips, shoulders or bust, this combo will probably be a nice fit. If you're curvy, you might want to rethink this. It's a shame since it comes in plus sizes. Maybe I should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit IMO 
 I'm glad to see I'm not the only one to notice the anti-White preaching in this book.   Not what I expected at all because this is how History is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that.   I was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned I already knew.   I graduated from high school in '89 and then got a Bachelor's degree from a state college that wasn't in History.   Perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education.   
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 The essence of "Iraq Confidential" is that the CIA and NSC were unwilling to permit a U.N. arm led by an American to successfully investigate what weapons Saddam had.  The problem was that U.N. policy was to lift sanctions once Saddam had shown disarmament, while U.S. policy was to retain sactions until regime change, regardless of Iraq's armament.  In addition, there were also problems with poor coordination between the CIA and FBI.  The key "bottom line" is that this Machiavellian U.S. strategy to defeat arms inspection probably led to the U.S. and G.B. being convinced in 2003 that Saddam had WMD when he actually had none, and thereby an unnecessary war.  As for Scott Ritter, he ended up becoming controversial himself (to say the least); fortunately Seymour Hersch's vouching for Scott makes the book credible.  Regardless, "Iraq Confidential" should have only been an article - not nearly 300 pages 
 It sure is easy for pundits and commentators to get book deals these days, when you can sell a tirade of personal opinions and second guessing as in-depth political analysis. Joe Klein has the added distinction of criticizing other people for doing exactly what he does, and of complaining about political and media trends from which he benefits directly. Klein has a reasonable basic point here about modern lowest-common-denominator politicking, in which image and sloganeering are seen as more important than knowledge and leadership. But Klein, in a display of mind-boggling myopia, can't even see that this exact same phenomenon allows weak and opinionated books like this to qualify as serious political analysis.  Granted, this book gets off to a pretty good start, with a prologue describing a 1968 campaign speech by Robert F. Kennedy, in which RFK spoke intelligently and respectfully to an African American crowd just hours after the Martin Luther King assassination. Klein laments the total disappearance of RFK-style dignity in modern American politics, and vows to analyze what has gone wrong and how modern campaigns can be made intelligent again. But this potential focus promptly disappears without a trace after the prologue. What follows is actually a history of the influence of villainous pollsters and consultants in recent presidential campaigns. Klein usefully criticizes the sappy image experts and number crunchers first, before spending much more time second guessing, with 20-20 hindsight, the losses of unsuccessful candidates.  The unintentional irony of Klein's punditry is unstoppable throughout the book. He complains about everyone else's unyielding ideology while simultaneously, and unilaterally, pronouncing certain positions, such as U.S. military superiority, as "correct" or "unassailable." Klein laments how over-hyped pollsters have made it a liability for politicians to appear realistically human, but then declares that certain presidential candidates (Democrats in general and Al Gore in particular) lost because they didn't appear - you guessed it - realistically human. In another contradiction, Klein forgives George W. Bush for lacking issue-specific knowledge, but later slams Howard Dean for the exact same thing. Klein also fancies himself a nonpartisan because he can criticize and disagree with both Republicans and Democrats, but this is merely an equal-opportunity mutation of the shallow punditry that he disdains from everyone else in his field. Even in these ridiculous political times, it's stupefying how much this book contributes to, and benefits from, the very problems it claims to debunk. But that's what passes for "analysis" these days. [~doomsdayer520~] 
 This book has plenty of tunes,but presents them very poorly. The small print of the tunes and the placement of two on a page makes reading very testing for a musician. Also the chord changes on some tunes,the bebop  tunes in particular,are wrong. This book is good for the casual player,but  one who is looking for decent representation of the music should look into  other sources 
 I was disappointed with this book because I expected more substance on how to cure cat behavioral problems.  Most of what was presented in the book was common sense.  The book also doesn't offer any in-depth case histories and therapy plans for cats with particular problems.  I feel this book would be useful for someone who knows little about cats.  However, if you are familar with cats and their basic needs, this book doesn't offer much more insight than most people would know.  I expected more from a well-known behaviorist.  If you are really looking for an in-depth book on pet behavior that is more useful, read Pam Johnson-Bennett's "Psycho Kitty" book.  I found it to be absolutely excellent. 
 This book is very funny. For all the wrong reasons. One sentence: "To look at the homosexual and say he or she is unnatural is like looking at an unconventionally clipped poodle or even an unclipped poodle and seeing that as unnatural." Uh-huh. Required reading for anyone into uncut poodles 
 I hate this unit with a passion and I sell the things. Its cheap, 299.99 at most retail place right now and that's what you are getting. The One died in 24 hours, while plugged in and never turned back on. It also directed us to a road that was headed into the Pacific Ocean, there is no road across in the pacific last time I checked. It acquired Satelites ONCE and then never acquired them again. And good luck talking to customer service, both I talked to didn't speak english...A dreadful unit, maybe TomTom could go work at Walmar 
 Burleigh's political agenda, made so obvious throughout this long and otherwise useful book, has to my knowledge never been mentioned by a single reviewer.  The author bludgeons the reader with his unoriginal contention that the Soviets were as murderous as the Nazis (or so very close the difference hardly matters), and he turns to this comparison at every possible juncture, including roads that do not meet.  One can hardly read two pages without a reference to the author's obsession. The book would have better been entitled, "The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany: A New Comparison," and that would be fine, but that's not the title I bought and wasn't the one I intended to read.  Not one serious reviewer mentions Burleigh's tendency to revel in his supposed political incorrectness, as if the year is 1965 and droves of lefties park their parkas in cafes, praising Stalin and railing against the bourgeoisie.  Obviously, someone has failed to inform Burleigh that his much beloved political incorrectness has become politically correct, his almost giddy pleasure in playing the role of a conservative "rebel" reminiscent of Bob Roberts in the Tim Robbins' film and rather ridiculous given the current political climate.  In several interviews, Burleigh rails against the continued interest in Nazism as a kind of pornography generated by, of course, the liberal media, which seems to have taken a vacation on the day it published his 800+ page tome about...Nazism. Burleigh's account of Nazi terror, so detailed that one can hardly bear the result, comes as close to his own definition of pornography as anything I can imagine, with the only possible exception being a person -- and the Internet suggests fetishists exist for nearly everything in the universe -- addicted to concentration camp footage. That brings me to the saddest point: Much of the information presented proves to be startlingly new and somehow even worse than imagined, especially the euthanasia program and the massacres that occurred on the Eastern front.  Unfortunately, we're reminded again and again that antisemitism stole many lives in the Soviet Union and its satellites, as if we didn't know that.  This correction of history, as Burleigh imagines it, takes place so often that one could almost assume the author really wants to say, "Yes, the Nazis were bad, but they did us a favor by invading the Soviet Union," only he seems to realize this would be a little too politically incorrect even for his tastes.  In summary, five stars for the information, one star for the interpretation.  With no 2.5 option available, I subtract .5 for Burleigh's rampant consultation of the thesaurus, apparently Roget's because where else would one find these words 
 This book is not funny, insightful, interesting or well written. The style is like prose on speed but ultimately there is nothing here. As a long term traveler to Italy, I saw nothing familiar other than some of the obvious stereotypes. Tim Parks does it better and with style in Italian Neighbors 
 BTS a book that stinks!  I am a true crime fan and this book is without doubt the absolutely worse book of true crime that I have ever read!  I skipped the entire middle of the book and just read the last few pages.  "Pastor Clown" is a main character..and that tell you how stupid this book actually is!  It should not even get one star 
 Mark Douglas's "The Disciplined Trader" is, quite frankly, inexhaustible in explaining the many facets of the psychology of trading, and much better than Koppel's many attempts at the subject 
 This book is total waste of time and money... I think the purpose is not giving insights about how to make a business, how to fund it... If you want to learn something about start-ups and how to finance them... Go and buy Lightspeed Business... Do not waste your time with this book.. 
 When the truth about 911 is known he must not escape justice. He is a criminal and must be treated like one. Christian Peper  
 I hate this whole idea.  I'm so tired of new agers sitting around doing nothing waiting for someone else to do all the work and save them.  It's pathetic.  I also hate how this author wants to neatly categorize people into tiny little boxes and put one neat little label on them.  Just the idea that an entire generation could be summed up in 1 sentence is insulting to any intelligent human being.  Am I an indigo kid? I don't know.  I'm certainly in the age group and I certainly have a complete lack of respect for authority.  I know who I am.  I also can't stand hypocrisy and people who won't get things done for themselves.  I am exceedingly empathic and can read people like a book, even over the internet.  But I do not have ADD.  I'm not here on some mission as a vanguard for a buncha little kids.  I'm not here to save humanity from anything. Humanity should save itself.  I have patience.   This book is just another example of a broken new ager praying that someone will tell her what to do. 
 Ick.  I bought Ultra Light Kirsch because I thought it would be similar to a discontinued grapey color that I used to love by Loreal.  Smell - Fake grade-school grape-aid smell grossed me out.  Feel - I LIKE lip gloss that feels glossy.  This stuff did not shine enough or last long enough.  Color - The color was to mild for me.    I was very disappointed.  I felt like I had wasted money and time. I still recommend Loreal Lip Juice, though. I believe it's the same company, and Lip Juice is glossy, shiny, long-lasting and way more cost-effective 
 I was forced to read this drivel for a graduate photo program. God I wanted to kill myself and quit photography by the time I was finished with it. If you want to read great photographic essays try Bill Jay's work. Amazing, insightful and filled with a sense of humor 
 I purchased this book because of the time it takes to assemble a shopping list for both "The Perricone Promise" and "The Perricone Weight Loss Diet". I thought this would do it for it. It lists a "basic guideline for foods", but it is not comprehensive of all the items needed to make the recipes on the two week diet. I'm still painstakingly going through the recipes to assemble my shopping list 
 This is definitely the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting by everyone in this movie sucks, and they all looked pathetic! The aircraft is hijacked and landed into the small town's non-commercial airport, the hijackers have just dropped dead bodies from the plane and asking for fuel or else they will kill more people, and the chief officer of sheriff dept. reacts by asking the old lady at the ATC tower "Can you fix me that coffee of yours?" ?? I mean the direction in this movie is best example of how bad a direction can be. As rightly pointed by one of the reviewers (P. Sullivan) here, another stupid example is that old lady passenger doing woo-hoo after the plane was landed with dead people everywhere. Again, don't expect anything on any front of direction, acting, scripts, storyline, and dialogues.   If you like movies based on aircrafts/actions, then watch Executive Decision, a lot better than this. I bought this DVD when it was available for $14.99, and I always felt that I wasted those few bucks. A waste of time and money!  
 First of all, I can't believe Trace got better reviews than Predator.  Predator was 1000 times better, but that's still not saying much.  Trace was just awful.  The worst in the series.  I can say with the certainty of the Great Scarpetta, that Patricia Cornwell did not write this book. One of her ghostwriters, who probably hates Scarpetta, wrote it.    This book is incomprehensible.  The story lines are disjointed, disconnected--just plain bad.  There is no follow through; the reader doesn't get the satisfaction of having everything tied together at the end.  What happened to Pogue?  Dr. Paulsson?  Mrs. Paulsson?  Dr. Marcus?  And what about Fielding? All of a sudden Fielding has a horrible skin condition and he's no longer in great shape and good looking.  Is this all because the Great Scarpetta was fired and moved away and the stress of life without her has ruined his physical appearance?  That's pretty riduculous. And the motivation of the killer is so weak and SOOOOO absurdly stupid, that I can't believe that Patricia Cornwell approved this awful imitation.   I'm so SICK to death of Lucy and her bad relationships, and I just can't stand Rudy. Also, in this book Lucy's father is now Cuban, instead of Brazilian, like he has been in the 12 previous books.  This ghostwriter has obviously never read any of Cornwell's Scarpetta novels.  Cuba and Brazil are two totally different countries and cultures!  To me, this is a huge oversight.  A good author takes note of every detail of the characters s/he creates, and I'm pretty sure that Cornwell isn't careless.  I digress...And then there's Benton and Kay, back together and back into the swing of their passionless, unfulfilling relationship.  Do they even like each other?  There's such tension and animosity between them.  Especially since Benton was never really dead; he was just undercover.  That whole story line was never explored in this horrible book. Even more evidence of poor ghostwriting--that was the greatest oversight. There's no hashing out of feelings and talking things through. All we're left with is Benton's five sentence explanation in Blow Fly. And Marino...I was horrified and acutally felt embarrassed when I read the part of Scarpetta taking pictures of Marino's injuries.  I don't want to give it away, if you haven't read the book.  That part is humiliating.  If you are a Scarpetta fan, you'll read this book despite the bad reviews.  In fact, you have to read it because you have see for yourself how truly terrible it is.  Just don't buy it.  Borrow it from the library 
 Here are some additional charges brought against Dr. Gary Almy (See Chicago Tribune 5 March 2005). Hardly the work of a Christian Counselor, maybe he should add an additional chapter to his book.  Psychiatrist facing 3rd sex abuse charge   Tribune staff reporter Published March 5, 2005 A psychiatrist accused of molesting two boys who attended a school run out of his Long Grove home was charged Friday with molesting a third student.  Gary Almy, 61, of the 3100 block of Old McHenry Road was charged with a third count of aggravated sexual abuse, said Lake County Assistant State's Atty. Matt Chancey.  Almy is being held in the Lake County Jail on $600,000 bail.  Authorities learned about a possible third victim from a statement Almy made to police, Chancey said. The abuse allegedly occurred between October 2003 and April 2004 when the boy from Indiana, then 14, attended Almy's Truth in Action Academy.  Almy, who calls himself a Christian counselor, was a staff psychiatrist at Lydia Home Association, a faith-based child-welfare agency in Chicago. He resigned when charged last month with fondling a 14-year-old in the summer of 2003 and a 10-year-old in October 2000.  Other allegations of abuse date to at least the 1980s, but those won't result in additional charges because the statute of limitations has expired, Chancey said.  One of those accusers filed a civil suit Thursday against Almy in Lake County Circuit Court, seeking more than $50,000. The 36-year-old Libertyville man repressed the memories of his sexual abuse until two years ago while undergoing treatment for alcohol and drug abuse, said his attorney, Robert Baizer of Highland Park.  The man grew up near the Almy home, Baizer said. While visiting the home and on a trip to Iowa, Almy fondled the boy, then in his preteens, about 20 times over a two-year period, the attorney said.  Baizer attributes his client's lifelong addiction to drugs and alcohol to the sexual abuse.  "[Almy] did destroy this kid's life. There's no question," Baizer said.

 I loved Steel's early works.  I read them all and they were great but have stopped reading her because her books are repetitive now.  I decided to try once again just to see and this book was maddening!!  It was 178 pages long and could have been all been said in 100 pages.  It was obvious that she was stretching it to make it a hardback "novel" length to sale.  Skip it.  
      Overall, I found this episode in the life and adventures of Randy Komisar to be interesting, but not groundbreaking.  Though certainly filled with some valuable insights, there was something more to be desired.  There was still a lot to learn, however, the most important being the general observations from a real-life perspective on what it takes to enjoy life in the entrepreneurial world.      The work itself was often scattered and forced.  There was no real continuity between the flashbacks, often sounding as if Mr. Komisar decided to insert various triumphs in his life whenever he felt like it.  Furthermore, I found the characters of Lenny and Allison to be more symbolic than human.  They were not actual individuals, but prompts put in by Komisar to respond to the questions he wanted answered.  In his interactions with them, Komisar walked an unhealthy line between humility and arrogance, presenting himself as a sort of low-key person who thinks outside the box, yet is always right on everything and draws reverence from those around him.  At times, I wondered whether this book was more of a teaching tool or a testament to his own greatness.      I found his main message to be useful, but somewhat hypocritical.  His criticism of the "work first and then retire" philosophy struck especially close to home, as that is one I have often embraced.  I paid close attention to his words and was partially persuaded.  I think he is downright contradictory, however, when he tries to use his own life as an example of how a business does better when fueled by complete passion and the expectation of it being one's life's work.  There were many times when I felt like screaming out, "Mr. Komisar, practice what you preach!"  Furthermore, I can think of so many ways that his theory is wrong.  Sometimes, the best businessman is one who has passion for what he/she is doing, but also has the ability to be objective and analyze the situation with an objective business savvy.  When he and his mentor Campbell (of Columbia fame!) ran GO to the ground, sticking with it through its crash landing, he writes as if that is a good thing.  That is fine when you have enough money to absorb that kind of failure, but most beginning entrepreneurs do not.  Komisar got where he is because of the strategy he condemns.      The other major problem with the book is the premise of funerals.com.  I found it to be a very poor example, as it unjustly generalized the funeral market.  While I am sure there are funeral homes who take advantage of people in their vulnerable, grieving states, I cannot think of anything less comforting than making arrangements over a computer instead of with people.  The character of Allison in representing the opposite extreme really represented absurdity.  If she were so feeling and caring, why not establish a not-for-profit website for grieving families?  I was never convinced that they were after anything but money, and the only evidence that their purpose was primarily moral was Komisar merely claiming it.  If this had been some kind of technological advancement in medicine, for instance, then I could have understood the enduring desire to save lives while also profiting.  The funeral example, however, is weak at best, and so is the pathetic Celestine Prophecy/Richest Man in Babylon rip-off with the riddle.      The strength of the book is in Komisar's thoughts about achieving happiness in life rather than about success in business.  Unlike the other characters, I was able to connect with Komisar as a human being, experimenting with different companies and developing his own tastes.  I gained a lot from reading his experiences, even if they were disjointed, and while I may have disagreed with him on some points, I learned from them.  I am glad I read the book, found it useful, but would hardly call it a masterpiece. 
 I purchased the camera in mid June 2006. After 1 month/1 hr of recording the screen went black when in recording mode. It took the shop about 7 week to fix the problem. I used the camera to record another 20 minutes and now it does not want to focus to infinite. The recording now flickers a lot and a dot appears floating around the screen. This camera has been in the shop more time than in my hands. The store were I bought it said that It would give me a new camera if this happends for the thrid time. The only problem is that if this is a design problem, what do I get by getting a new camera? Just avoid buying this camera until they fix the problem 
 I am one of the women who is suppose to find this book helpful because I do not neatly fall into one of the four seasons ....my mother thinks I am a summer, my hairdresser thinks I am a Spring, my husband says I am an autumn.  So I buy this book and now I am more confused then ever!  The authors use terms they do not define such as muted or topaz, terms which are critical to me being able to sort out my season confusion.  Then they suggest I use "color draping" by grabbing clothes or even towels from around the house that match obscure and subtle color differences.  Ah, I do not have a "mango" and "salmon" towels or at least I do not think I do.  It is hard to tell since the color swatches in the book are as bad as everyone else complains they are.  On the up side, I have reread the book four times and really want to like it but I still have NO idea what colors would suit me.  Bottom line...do not buy this book 
 This book illustrates the difference between important and merely influential. It virtually invented the vague/portentious prose style that signifies boredom and alienation, and appeared as late as 1996 on the liner notes of Rage Against the Machine's "Evil Empire".  But it isn't very good. The dimestore existentialism aged, badly. Didion's spare writing now seems phony and juvenile. The same characters experiencing the same emotions have been rehashed so many times, often in superior forms, that what was innovative in the seventies doesn't really cut it anymore. Not that it was very original in its time, coming as it did after thirty years of Sartre and ten of Antonioni. Not to mention Horace McCoy's terrific 1935 novel "They Shoot Horses Don't They", popularized in a Hollywood film (coincidentally?) only a year before "Play It"'s publication.  A minor footnote to a still-evolving trend 
 This is a warning.  This is an atrocious translation and should be avoided. Hopkins, who translated this work in 1906 is either sloppy or just a poor translator.  The English is awkward, and what is most reprehensible, Hopkins just plain omits two of the most important factual items of the entire play--1) Gone is Pepel's admission that he spend time in prison because he murdered a man, and 2) and this is the most grievous of all, the fact that Actor hanged himself at the play's cnclusion (almost the last words of the play which produces an immense impoact) is also omitted.   There is no good reason other than monetary since all copywrite is probably gone for this edition, to republish it.   I learned this the hard way, using it in a class amd now have subjected my students to this particular translation.  It is a wonderful play, but this edition should be taken off the market 
 I didn't know this sort of 18th and 19th century Travel Literature was still being written today. Tom Miller travels awful far to come home with his suitcase full of frat-boy stereotypes and over determined metaphors. Cubans here are sexy, mango eating, Chevy driving caricatures. Having  traveled there frequently over the last ten years, I can tell you the only  subject illuminated by this book is the inability of Miller's mind to look  past his own North American biases. There are excellent books about Cuba  written by strangers to that country, see Cardenal's for example. There are  also excellent books about Cuba written by Cubans, see for example Franqui.  This book however is not worthy of the trees that died for it 
 I too purchased the Target $3.98 copyand found it to be missing so much of the orginal movie that I am returning it.  I reviewed the box it came in yet there is no mention of a 'cut' version.  Shame on Target for passing this off as the movie without notifying customers of the cut verion 
 I'M SORRY BUT THIS IS NOT A MOVIE YOU WOULD WANT TO SPEND ANY MONEY ON. REALLY. I WOULD ALSO NOT RECOMMEND EVEN RENTING ( BUT DO THAT IF YOU MUST SEE FOR YOURSELF ) IT AS AFTER THE FIRST APPEARENCE OF THE GHOST IT'S ALL A STRAIGHT DOWNHILL RIDE. IF AMAZON HAD A NO STAR THAT'S WHAT I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS. YOU'RE WAITING FOR THAT MOMENT THAT REALLY NEVER COMES. A VERY WEAK EFFORT 
 This book says nothing useful, and not much that isn't an anecdotal stereotype.  Save your money! 
 this never rises above the slease and sexualy warped mind of mr. de palma. angie dickison's shower scenes are just a sick joke like the whole movie. watch a hitchcock movie if you want a good thriller,and stay away from this junk!! 
 I bought this book primarily for information regarding accounting and general ledger systems. I read all the great reviews here and thought this would be a great book.  I am very disappointed.  The entire section on accounting is only 40 pages and contains only a cursory overview of accounting systems and structures. They include a CD with the book which is supposed to contain actual SQL data structures but you have to pay them $350.00 to unlock the CD.  Given the depth of the book I would be reluctant to risk paying them that much for simple data structures which you can easily find elsewhere on the web for free.  In all honesty I have not studied this book fully but in my opinion it was a waste of money and I will try to return it to Amazon.  
 Ms. Reichs has lost the recipe, or at least the focus and formula that has brought her success prior to Cross Bones. Although not nearly as bad as P. Cornwell's last two or three misfires, Reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here. In this offering, Temperance is out of character, out of both style and focus, and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous; a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product. Even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice Reichs has maintained in her many Brennan novels. Having finally given up on Cornwell, after many years, I'll hang in there for one more Temperance Brennan dig; everyone is entitled to one gong 
 Having just finished and been mesmerized by "The Emperor's Children", I had high hopes for delving into Claire Messud's earlier works.  This book just fails to engage me on any level, and I tried - truly, gave it about 150 pages worth of trying, but was tempted to leave it in the seat pocket of my flight home last night.  
 There is no other explanation. The following quote is all you really need to know to prove that Andrea is unstable and most likely hates who she is. "I want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high-heel shoved in his mouth, like an apple in the mouth of a pig." - Andrea Dworkin. If a man were to say something like this, I'm sure she'd call for his arrest. 
 I gave this a bad review because it's a) not written or published by Gwen Stefani as Amazon claims, and b) not music.  It's a CD filled with interviews and that's it.  The interviews are pretty interesting but nothing you can't find at a good Gwen Stefani fan site, and nothing that is worth more than a couple bucks.  
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 False Doctines from the pit of hell 
 Years ago, the trainer of my 3-months old coonhound recommended staying away from this book, describing it as "the best way to get your dog to be afraid of you and mess up your relationship forever!".  But I wanted to read it, to know what it was all about... I cannot tell you how many times I was fuming realizing how ignorantly these Monks approach dogs' psychology and the physical and psychological violence they use. The temptation of throwing that piece of junk out the window was strong, but I read it through to make sure I could talk about it as bad as I can with the knowledge of its contents. I am saddened to find out that they are still out there... This is the training philosophy for frustrated humans that need to dominate to compensate their own insecurities.  Meanwhile I am a trainer myself and I support a more constructive approach to dog training based on positive reinforcement.  If you know nothing about dogs' psychology, and want to learn more from "The Voice" in dog behavior I suggest "The Other End of the Leash" by Patricia McConnell or "Culture Clash"  by Jean Donaldson or "The Power of Positive Dog Training" by Pat Miller. If you would like to become a benevolent leader of the pack without imposing yourself to your dog with violence or fear, I suggest "How to be the Leader of the Pack...And have Your Dog Love You for It" ("How to" booklets from Dog's Best Friend) by Patricia B. McConnell. All these books are written by professionals that have been working with dogs and studying dogs' behaviors, but they are very entertaining and easy to read and comprehend. Patricia McConnell also wrote a number of other books addressing specific behavioral issues.   
 It's a pretty good toy but most people get sick of them as they get frustrated and can't do every side the same colour on each side. If you're ready for frustration then this cube is for you. If you are buyin it then have fun 
  Absolute Rubbish,not even close to the brilliance of the original recording.If you loved the original like I did you will hate this 
 I would say that this book is poorly written, except that saying that it was written at all gives it too much credit. Almost no writing was done for this book; it's more accurate to say that the book was "compiled" out of a stack of example problems.  The author seems to have taken the idea that, "Students don't ever really read textbooks" to heart and crafted a book that simply cannot be read. The best you can do is browse through it, looking for examples that match what you're trying to do and studying them. His sample solutions are detailed, but they make little attempt to teach the intuition behind why certain steps are chosen. Nor can that intuition be learned from the main text of the chapter, as there is wretchedly little of it.  A horrible book; bad even by the low standards that math textbooks are generally held to 
 THREE VIEWS ON EASTERN ORTHODOXY AND EVANGELICALISM is one of Zondervan's "Counterpoint" books, where theological issues are debated by all sides of the issue. Here the "Yes" position is taken by Bradley Nassif (Orthodox), the "No" position is taken by Michael Horton (evangelical) and Vladimir Berzonsky (Orthodox), and finally a "Maybe" position is argued by George Hancock-Stefan (evangelical) and Edward Rommen (Orthodox). Each of the participants makes an argument, is rebutted by the others, and then offers final words. As one might guess, the Orthodox argue that their churches have been "evangelical" in a sense all along and one merely needs to stress those facets of their own tradition. The Evangelical commentators argue against Orthodox from several viewpoints. For Mr Horton, Orthodox's view of justification, which he sees as nebulous, is a major problem. Mr Hancock-Stefan, though he argues "Maybe", says that the traditions aren't really compatible at all from what he sees as a tradition of church and state oppression of evangelicals, and suggests that the Orthodox should just cross to the other side.  As an Orthodox Christian, I was unhappy with the book. For one, it is simply unwise for the Orthodox to approach the evangelicals at all in debate. The inroads that evangelicals have made into Orthodox countries such as Romania have resulted in serious damage to local spiritual and cultural life, and Orthodox synods (such as those of Iasi and Jerusalem) have repeatedly condemned them in no uncertain terms. But beyond that, the biggest problem with this debate is that the editors did not set one specific definition of evangelicalism to work with. The EO commentators write in response to that non-confessional evangelicalism that has become mainstream over the last century, which doesn't even look back to the early Protestant reformers, let alone the Church Fathers. However, Michael Horton, writing from a Reformed perspective, answers every critique of this evangelicalism by proclaiming how the Reformed churches are different, how they look back to Calvin, and how Calvin looked back to the early Fathers. Mr Horton seems to have entered the discussion with the assumption that his partners in debate would be speaking to him of his own tradition. A second problem is that the evangelical commentators don't really seem to get Orthodoxy at all. That's only to be expected, since they happily remain evangelicals, but it makes their entire treatment of Orthodoxy very frustrating to read. The insistence by evangelicals that the Orthodox Church does not stress a personal relationship with Christ is pure slander, for the importance of the so-called "Jesus prayer" is known even by the least theologically educated Orthodox layman. Mr Horton seems to think that agreements in doctrine between the Reformed tradition and Orthodoxy actually amount to something, but as the Reformed tradition simply lacks the continuity back to the day of Pentecost that the Orthodox Church can claim, it's all quite meaningless to pile up similarities 
 I hate to sound mean, but I just can't abide this instructor.  I have DOZENS of Firm tapes, but this is the one tape I gave away. She's nice, but a poor instructor - her cuing is late on the moves, and to me, it's really distracting.  Get another Firm tape, most of them have great lower body sections.  Forget this one 
 I recommend reading this book, and follow along with Webster Tarpley's 911 Synthetic Terror Made in the USA. Also David Ray Griffins "A New Pearl Harbor". By the end of this exercise if you still believe the official myth put forth by this tome of lies, deceit and treason you should seek professional help.   Seriously this is not only wrong on nearly every relevant fact (Purposely), but purposefully ignores all the facts that could distract from the official MYTH that they were appointed to propagate.   Good job Keane! Great Whitewash! You'll go down in history as presiding over one of the biggest packs of lies ever created to cover up mass murder. What does this make you? 
 this game is overrated  and there is to much aimless wandering . the same thing over and over  hope they dont make prey  
 Unfortunately, there are many writers who have talent, but no subject to write about. So they turn to fashionable fads and the emptiness of life to create stories so absurd and pointless that the reader (unless he or she shares that same emptiness) leaves out totally... well, empty. The only reason I'm giving this book two stars is because, as I said, Noteboom can write, and because there are several clever and even bright sentences in the book. The subject seems to be the Death of God in modern life, and it is an interesting one, only the author should have written a philosophical essay instead of a narrative.  Inni Wintrop is a lonely man totally estranged from his family. One day an aunt arrives and introduces him to an ex-lover, a man also estranged from his family and from the world. This man has a very cheap, infantile, Greenpeace-like anti-human environmental "philosophy". This man has replaced God with Nature and a neurotical daily schedule. Years later, Inni meets the man's son,  an Indonesian who pathetically follows each and every oriental New Age philosophy (until he commits suicide).   In the first chapter, entitled "Interlude", the author tells us the story of how Inni lost his wife, because he got to bed with other women and never paid any attention to her (strange, so, that she leaves him).  That's the book, disconnected clever musings about how God doesn't exist and how lonely we are in this cold world. No character is deep or likable in the least, there is no plot nor conflict nor anything but the repulsive contemplation of people with nothing to do but gaze at their navels and look for stupid rituals to supplant God. None of them even have real jobs 
 I purchased this DVD hoping it would relay information on coral reefs and the myriad of life living in them.  While the focus of the movie was on the endangerment of the reefs due to global warming, overfishing, etc., most of the movie was spent above the water focusing on the the filmmaker and his wife and their trivial lives.  The imagery was beautiful when they were under the water, but it's only a small percentage of film.  Very disappointing 
 First the good news.  This is an extra heavy skillet with durable finish and good handles.  It easily handles two quarts up to the bottoms of the rivets and distributes the heat evenly across the bottom of the pan.  But for the bad news I would give this skillet four or five stars.  The bad news is that someone at the Anolon plant damaged the pan BEFORE it was placed in the Anolon carton.  Neither the Anolon box nor the outer UPS shipping carton showed any damage when I received the skillet.  It wasn't until the the following day, after I threw out the packaging, that I noticed the a small sharp blow had been delivered to the rim of the pan which deformed the pan slightly.  True, I should have been more attentive when I received the pan,  but I never suspected Anolon would package damaged goods.  I'll live with my mistake but will not purchase anything by Anolon again!  
 The film would be interesting and the acting is good, but there are lines streaking the film and odd bursts of green color and the general color is faded and there are skips in the film as well. It is so bad it is hard to watch 
 Apart from some reasonable songs (One Wish - Track 4, War is Over Track 8), I really didn't feel like this album was all there. To be honest I haven't really taken the time to listen to most of the tracks & in hindsight I wouldn't have bought this CD. His talent is clear but a little more tweaking at the studio may be warranted! 
 Before clicking the link on this page for this film I knew that someone would say VERY BAD MOVIE, OR VERY BAD FILM, it is awful, but me and my friend use to laugh when we'd mention the title of this film and at the end when he's spinning around in a wheelchair. How can some of the best actors be in such a film, great cast, bad script, bad movie, it's stupid, and very violent, there are parts that are funny though like when Daniel Stern says "Have you done this before"? when he knew what to do with the body. Yes it is awful, it really is. The darkest "comedy" ever, they went way too far. It's almost as sick as the movie FREEWAY another movie with great actors in such a terrible film. Atrocious films. 
 I never received the product that I ordered - it was never delivered even though they said it was - someone was here all the time.  So I am very dissatisfied.  I don't like to order things and never receive them.  Reaga 
 My son loved the idea of this toy and was so excited to receive it as a birthday gift.  However one club broke almost immediately and the other broke shortly after that.  It is poor quality and construction.  Don't use it unless your kids are the gentle kind.  Most kids would break this the first time.  [... 
 Fante seems quaint and offensive by today's standards. Another wholly disappointing offering from a mediocre writer, like a second-rate Steinbeck best left to obscurity 
 A toughguy who likes Tai Chi - how unpredictable. No, really. Oh, and he has a beautiful but neurotic ex, and then a stable ex, and there's supposed to be drama. And then he investigates some plot retired from old episodes of Dallas twenty years ago. This isn't badly written, and if you haven't seen through Robert Parker yet, maybe you'll still enjoy it, but to me it was predictably "unpredictable" and devoid of any real reading value 
 I bought this book thinking that the author would go through some cases, explaining how she does psychotherapy.  Not exactly.  This book is more of a survey of psychotherapy--basically telling you everything you pretty much already know about it.  What's even more frustrating is that not only is it a waste of a book, it's a waste of money. Very frustrating. (I'm surprised too because everyone else gave it such high reviews....I'm not sure what they were smoking... 
 well, i thought that the book was coming. when i did not arrive at the last possible date i emailed and was told it was on backorder.  they did let me get a refund which was nice.  i would use them again for that reason alone.  
 I bought it for 59.00 on the gold box deal and it arrived yesterday. I returned the product. very poor quality, poor finish, dull right out of the box.  stay away from this on 
 Loved Dharma Bums, can't forget On the Road, enraptured with Desolation Angels, and bored to death with the Subterraneans. Only read the first 20 pages, though. Couldn't get farther then that, so maybe it really picks up. Love the first page however. It's really Kerouac at his nonsensical worst 
 The information is inaccurate according to historical records.  I would suggest reading "A Ghost Hunter's Guidebook" (Third Edition) by Troy Taylor and "So There I Was... More Confessions of Ghost Hunters" by Troy Taylor and Len Adams for more information on The Myrtles.  You can also do a search on the internet for the article "The Legends, Lore and Lies of The Myrtles Plantation".  Or, if you're ever in St. Francisville, you can go to the courthouse and the historical society and check through the records yourself.  For instance, Winter was indeed murdered on the front porch by an unknown assailant but after being shot, he immediately fell down and died.  His bloody trip through the house never took place -- information that was easily found in historical records.  There is also no evidence to say that Judge Woodruff ever carried on affairs with his slaves.  Although the house is genuinely haunted, which can be attested to by generations of owners, guests, and ghost hunters, it is not haunted for any of the reasons that have been claimed in the publicity surrounding the house.  As has been said more than once - "when the legend is better than the truth, print the legend".  This is an adage that has been closely followed by the Myrtles, misleading hundreds of ghost hunters and enthusiasts over the years.  I do not discount paranormal activity at The Myrtles - just the legends that surround them.  Although, some of the events in this book are not quite true to the nature of ghosts (read Troy Taylor's "A Ghost Hunter's Guidebook" (Third Edition) for more information on that).  I am compelled to say that the story about black kids having classes with black teachers and white kids having classes with white teachers and that there was a black lunch and a white lunch in school (when Ms. Kermeen bought The Myrtles) is not true.  I was in high school in Louisiana at the time Kermeen bought The Myrtles.  Black and white kids went to the same classes, were taught by both black and white teachers, and they all ate lunch together - and had been doing so since before I started school.  In 1980, the federal government would not have allowed this separation to occur no matter what the local residents' feelings were on the subject.  My mother was a teacher in Louisiana at the time of integration.  By federal mandate, black students and teachers and white students and teachers had to be combined - and it had to be as equal as possible.  This was not a choice and this happened way before 1980.  I am currently a teacher in the Louisiana public school system so I do know a bit about its history and the federal regulations governing the public school system.  This separation would absolutely never have occurred.  This story was too much like The Amityville Horror...more of a "Hollywood" type ghost story than a "true" ghost story.  It's a waste of money and it insults your intelligence.  This quote is from a booklet about The Myrtles: "James and Frances Kermeen Meyers passed through St. Francisville in the 1980s on a riverboat cruise and while visiting purchased the Myrtles. The Meyers ownership coincided neatly with the then-current fad of "Murder Mystery Weekends" in which local historians and surviving family members say that history was rewritten in a manner they consider "disgraceful"."  If you're interested in true ghost stories, read books by Troy Taylor.  He's written quite a few 
 The Spanish Prisoner had a great storyline but the acting was terrible. Not to mention the lightening in the film made it seem like a Lifetime movie (no offense). Rent at best, but not worth buying 
 Perricone wants you to think he has come up with a complicated system of dieting and supplementation.  In reality, all you need is to eat naturally, like our ancestors did thousands of years ago. Eat greens, vegetables, berries, fruit, mushrooms, nuts. Eat lean meat (our ancestors hunted for healthy, lean animals). Eat egg whites, but avoid yolks. Most of the modern contaminants stick to fat molecules, and yolks are mostly fat. Plus it's the wrong type of fat, as chickens are not fed properly. Eat wild fish (but not too often; don't forget about pollutants).  That's it. Forget grains (and everything made from them, of course). Forget potatoes and hard beans, soda and juices. Forget vegetable oils. All that junk is completely unnatural for humans to eat; our ancestors couldn't imagine that was edible. And that's why we have diseases that they didn't have.  Forget milk. Milk is only good for babies under 3 years old. Studies show that milk (and even yogurt) causes hyperinsulinemia (insulin "spikes" that lead to diabetes etc.) in adults.  Take fish oil. Farm-raised animals are fed with junk food; consequently, they lack certain fatty acids that are vital for our health. Fish oil is a convenient way of restoring the balance. (Perricone's fish oil is far from the best on the market).  I'm a physiologist, and I've helped a number of people to change their eating habits. Those people have gotten rid of many problems, like obesity, allergies, asthma, arthritis, and excessive fatigue. And they don't complain that the food is not delicious enough. They learned to use their imagination a little bit and combine various healthy foods to create their nice and simple "recipes", and realized they enjoy their food even more than before.   Regarding Perricone's skin products: The author does not mention any controlled double-blind studies that would directly test their effects. This means that he either has not done such studies, or the results were negative 
 Iam not at all happy that i could not watch this product the three fugitives and 83 hours til dawn and am unable to buy this product in Australia. I think it suck that dvds have region departments and can only be watched in some countries People should be able to buy a product and be able to watch it. The sooner a dvd comes out that is able to be watched in all countries the better.  
 I was so disappointed with this CD.  At least 6 of the songs were recorded from VERY OLD albums....scratches and all!  They were SO bad. I play two of the songs over and over...the only two I liked. When I read the other reviews and there was mention of leaving out some of the songs, I assumed that they meant doubles of the same song....I was wrong. I don't know WHY they had to add the scratchy music..a filler?  I would quickly skip to another song...only to have to "skip" many times! 
 This book consists of theses, written by researchers in various fields, on various themes such as hyperreality, fashion, capitalism, postmodernism, and feminism. Therefore, I think that there are some theses in which  Baudrillardfs thoughts are not understood at all. The constitution of this  book is not so good because each researcher mention freely to various  notions without big theme that combines each thesis. It is disappointing  that discussions on Baudrillard do not develop between each thesis. If each  thesis were complementary to each other, this book would be more  interesting and more controversial 
 Sean Hannity's rise to fame proves that an ignorant illiterate can rise well beyond the level of incompetence in this country, especially when their audience consists of like-minded organ banks.  Hannity is stupid, hypocritical and loud.  His sole redeeming quality is as a mechanism for carbon-oxygen exchange.  Hannity is well-coiffed, well dressed  and well short of thorazine on his overhyped comedy duo called the Hannity and Combs report.  This bozo is so uptight he must wear a chastity belt 2 sizes too small.  Get a real job, you poser 
 Very dissapointing DVD - had great expectations given the cast - the storyline and manner in which it was directed was dismally poor - do not buy this film! 
 Abraham Lincoln's law partner once wanted to read some maudlin poetry to Abe.  Once he was done, Lincoln said "The people who like this sort of thing will find it the sort of thing they like."  Beaches is fine.  It is obviously a chick flick.  Bette Midler has some real opportunities to sing.  The acting is good.  The problem is that the plot is so predictable 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 I thought "Silver Pigs" was wonderful. By this one, Falco is tiresome, trite and boring. The humourous cynicism present in the earlier novels seems to be both studied and begrudging in the later ones. And the family is NOT that cute. Still, there are a few flashes of humour. If Falco would ditch the extended family, Davis would tighten up the writing and not be quite so coy, this series could be salvaged. Davis should take a few lessons from John Maddox Roberts and Decius 
 I have read all of the Artimis Fowl Books and loved them until now  I was disapointed with this one, and not found Artmis unusaly irritating, but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good.   Truth be told I was younger when I read the first three, but still I can reread them and enjoy them (as I did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris) so if you want my advice then I suggst you don't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace 
 Very few helpful suggestions in this book. The authors are Pharmacists. They list side effects of herbs that would happen to maybe 1 in a billion people. They state that dandelion can cause, "Skin irritation... blockage of the digestive  or biliary tract, gallbladder inflammation, gallstones" but on the SAME page say that it is used for "digestive complaints, gallbladder problems, to stimulate bile production". Now, why would you use a plant that helps with gallbladder problems if it causes them?? (by the way, it does not, I have much experience with this plant and have never had any side effects, nor has anyone I have spoke with). This book will do nothing but make you paranoid of about using herbs. If you want a good book, get "The New Age Herbalist" or anything by Rosemary Gladstar, Dr. James A. Duke or James Green. Peterson Field guides are also quite good 
 West is without a doubt a superb writer, however I found The Shoes of The Fisherman to be a great dissapointment.  In spite of the fact that most of the reviews I have read higly praise the book, it never really got to me.  The concept seems quite interesting at first:  an unknown russian, cardinal Kiril Lakota is elected pope.  After being held prisioner for quite a few years, he steps up to lead millions of people around the globe in a new world which he basically has knowledge of only from his years in captivity.  At the same time, Kamanev, the man who had been Lakota's prision guard in Russia, and who tortured him beyond belief, has become the head of the russian government.  The fact that both men now need each other provides for a very interesting plot, which in my opinion is never fully developed.  The main issue I have with the novel is that it is plotless...nothing really happens.  A large portion of the book consists of  a series of endless, and a bit boring, thoughts  from Lakota.  On the other hand, the reader is exposed to the way the catholic church funtions and thinks, which is an interesting way to humanize religion in he eyes of the reader.  There are also a series of sub-plots dealing with what Lakota has to face as a pope, regading human cruelty, poverty, and most of all politics, which could have proven to be enough for a good novel.  Unfortunatelly, the narration goes astray in many parts, which lessens one's interest in the book. Quite frankly, I had to make a great effort to finish the book, hoping that at some time it would pick up, which it never did.  As I mentioned before, West is a very good writer, but this book is in my opinion, highly overrated.  I can honestly say it never got my full atention. 
 First let me say this was my first exposure to Jodi Picoult, so maybe her authorship of many novels may imply talent, I can't comment beyond this book. That said, this was one of the few "novels" I was always reluctant to resume and ultimately abandoned halfway through. In addition to another reviewer's comments on shifting POV (for what reason?, I couldn't come to terms with it), unrealistic characters, and soap-opera-type scenes, it was jarring to come across a lack of basic writing skills in some passages. "Pop lit" came to mind immediately, and while I tried to finish this book loaned by a friend, I found it an irritating endeavor. Despite some popularity, I'm not likely to pick up another Picoult book 
 The book may be entertaining to read because of the way Mankiw sets his examples. Unfortunately what we have in our hands is the same irrealistic exposition of how the economy works that has been dominating university curriculums from the first day Adam Smith was appointed at Glasgow. As an example I may cite my personal experience as a teaching assistant. When explaining the comparative advantage theory I obviously gave the Ricardian demonstration of the theory. But when I wanted to treat the absolute advantage theory, Marx's name was nowhere to be found. Even Samuelson devoted some pages to Marx's contribution to economic theory. President Bush's economic advisor seems to lack objective exposition when dealing with basic economic theories. I don't consider myself to be paranoid, but the economics curriculum, and it's instruments, such as this book, only serve a mode of reproduction of the dominant ideology, which we all know has lots of contradictions that everyday spring up in everybody's life. It is time to bring to the market a more balanced exposition of the various tendencies within economics, even if the course is described as being introductory. Most of the people who take these basic courses don't even know that there are alternative paradigms. They just finish their Mankiw's as if nothing else could be thought about how the economy really works 
 The two CARCASS classic EPs have way better material than what the new Arch Enemy have to offer here, for me there is only 3 Arch Enemy masterworks. Starting with "Black Earth", following with "Stigmata" and reaching its height with "Burning Bridges". 
 If all you want is the patient information often handed out by drug stores, this is the book for you -- it covers almost all the prescription drugs on the market.  If, however, you want the pharmacology, etc., or even the name and address of the drug maker, you need the full PDR 
 This novel of a 17th century samurai's odyssey to Europe starts as a very straightforward story and rather continues that way, but towards the end, Endo does get in a few good points. The style is somewhat pedantic and staid, but easy to read. It's certainly not a zen classic and the story never really gets off the ground or totally convinces. The historical backdrops are paper thin and obvious cut-and-pastes from history textbooks. I must admit I am somewhat baffled by all the rave reviews here. I can only conclude that a lot of people who don't really have much experience of Japan, think they've stumbled upon some sort of motherlode of bushido spirit in this conveniantly Westernized piece of writing by a Japanesese Christian. Remember, not every Japanese woman is a geisha, and not every Japanese writer can wield his pen like a samurai's sword 
 I'm taking a college course and this book really bites. Reading it just leaves me in a daze. He goes on and on about how this method won't work and that method won't work which completely covers up what we need to learn. I'm getting 98.18% in the class on term 8 of 10, but it's not due to this book. Unfortuneatley I'm stuck with the book because it's what the school uses. Find another one 
 would not work with 624 D-link, even after several phone conversations and hours on the line with dlink technicians.  the techs couldn't offer any solution beyond what was written in the instructions and worse, they clearly did not care whether it worked or not -- they could not wait to just tell me to ship it back to amazon where I bought it from so they could get off the phone...  it was disgusting 
 This is a novel in superlative style: 'heroic, magnanimous, exalted, brightly, caressingly, exquisite, fascinating, wonderful, sublime, radiant, delightful ...' It confronts and mingles very superficially two impoverished Europeans with members of a wealthy Boston bourgeoisie family in a play of misunderstood sentiments and love. There is absolutely not a shade of a discussion of the social/mental difference between Europe and the US at the end of the 19th century. This book doesn't 'say nothing' (Thomas Hardy, quoted in the introduction), but nearly nothing. It hardly surpasses the level of a three-penny stationary novel, compared with the works of a Dostoevsky or a Flaubert. It is terribly sentimental and the tears flow easily.  Only for Henry James fans 
 I read the reviews and was sure that I'd found the perfect honey dispenser. But, after a while, it leaks. They all leak. I am stuck (no pun intended) with a honey ring on my counter.  The flaw is at the back of the spout. The cut off cover does not reach the back... and so the honey drips out 
 The first sentence in this book goes like this..." I never met Bill Hicks..." Well, that does not up the authors credibility for me. I quit the book halfway through because it lacked cohesion. This book could stand to have an editor and another editor whip through it 
 Every one of them has been trouble, and all the trouble is in the base. The cheap metal contacts droop in a week and then do not make good contact with the batteries (fix: open base, extend contacts) and the base O-ring always fails and in no time the contacts corrode. Also, batteries last only a few weeks at best. 
 I'm an "old movie buff" and I find this to be a pretty awful movie.  It's really full of the most simple-minded dialogue.  See these great actors in something that's a little less polemical.  The writers' social conservatism just jumps off the screen.  You could use this for a Media Studies film to contrast with an "old film" from the same time that shows people living with much more self-awareness.  Two stars only for the bright young daughters - great actresses

 I've never taken an economics class in my life.  I'd always heard that economists spoke a different language than everyone else, and in some instances, lived on a different planet than everyone else.  After reading the very enjoyable "Freakonomics," I decided I might be wrong, because if "Freakonomics" was an example of what Economics is all about, then it was fascinating.  So I went in search of a book on Economics that would also be accessible to the layman, and came across "Hidden Order," which only reinforced my earlier stereotypes.  Despite a great opening chpater or two, I put the book down after 5 chapters, as each one became more incomprehensible than the last.  I have no doubt there is some very good information in this book.  Unfortunately, it's written in a mixture of English and "Economics-ese" -- just when you think you're close to understanding what Friedman is trying to get across, he throws in a chart and some terminology that makes everything incoherent.  On top of this, many of the examples and explanations he uses make absolutely no sense...at least no sense to anyone who lives in the real world.   Perhaps this book would be useful to someone who has taken an Econ class or two, but if you haven't, you'll simply find this book frustrating.  Thank goodness I checked it out of library and didn't have to pay for it 
 Only the most die hard Heinlein fans would want to read this. On the other hand, I think most die hard Heinlein fans who read it will wish they hadn't. This is not good, and is a disservice to his legacy 
 Pretty forgettable outing from the Surfers is almost totally comprised of conventional songs. A sad drop from the Latino Buggerveil glory days that true Surfer fans (such as myself) know and cherish. Some of the songs even sound like rip-offs of earlier Surfer tunes: "Cough Syrup" sounds distressingly similar to "I Saw an X-Ray of a Girl Passing Gas".   Pretty sad, in all. The Butthole Surfers remain one of the great experimental rock bands of all time. Their first four albums are towering acheivements, but "Electric Larryland" isn't even close to being in the same class. Gone is the psychotic menace and disorienting fever of "Psychic Powerless", "Rembrandt Pussyhorse" and "Locust Abortion...". Even the freak-out songs on the album ("My Brother's Wife") are a little tired and sound more like someone trying (in vain) to imitate early surfers.   I will always respect and love and follow this great band, but this is not one of their best albums, nor is it an album for a prospective fan to start with. Pick up one of their first four releases or "Humpty Dumpty" instead. 
 This is probably the worst war related movie I've ever seen. I am particularly incensed by several actors who are featured as being in the film are present for as little as a single minute or two. Time spent watching this film is time you'll never get back and have nothing to show for it 
 Loved his other books but this was all over the place, hard to read, and to apply 
 My 3 year old loves making patterns with her snap beads. I was so excited to find these beads with the cute designs. However, I was very disappointed when they arrived. The plastic is too thick, making the beads very heavy. They do not stay together well at all. We ended up buying her some of the "original" snap beads and giving these away. 
 When I first heard Venus Isle, I thought "not nearly as good as Ah Via Musicom"...but it IS Eric Johnson, so I gave it a chance.  After a few listens, the album started growing on me.  Unfortunately, after about 10 listens, I can't stand it.  What eventually killed me is the AWFUL lyrics that over-pepper a couple of songs and literally make up the rest.  If I had read the latter without knowing who wrote them, I would've guessed they were written by a pretentious grammar school student...a pubescent, bisexual girl in the throes of puppy love ("I still feel the same, all about you...'cause your the king of hearts").  Considering Eric's strong/veteran background and the fact that, after absorbing all his previous material, I know of what he's capable, the music on most of the songs with lyrics is weak, too.  I can't give more than 1 star for an album on which I have to fast-forward through the majority of the songs just to get to the solos. "Camels Night Out" (instrumental) is particularly boring and, as a fan/consumer/guitarist, I'm disappointed that Eric published it. Love the tone, but...  Speaking of solos, there are some good ones (nothing on the caliber of, let's say, "Desert Rose"), but many are way too "scholastic".  On too many songs, Eric just half-heartedly samples through a few scales instead of really going off until capturing something special or spending the time to craft an appropriate/memorable solo.    Even though there was over 5 years between AVM and this, VI was obviously still rushed (despite it's high production level). Hindsight being 20/20, I would have borrowed it only to burn "Manhattan", "SRV" and "Pavillion" to an EJ compilation CD...just these 3 songs are not worth the $20 I spent to aquire this album 
 The book contains a lot of factual error and represent one-sided pro-Armenian version of the history and the culture of the region. For those who want to know the history of Karabakh I strongly recommend Black Garden by Thomas de Waal. 
 I really like the look of this bread bin, but the manufacturer does not package it in a box.  It only has a clear plastic bag around it.  Even though Amazon uses it's own box for shipping, it arrived with dents and cracks.  Amazon quickly replaced it with another one, which had dents, cracks, and the entire bottom was was badly scratched.  I don't have time to keep sending these back hoping to get a replacement which isn't damaged, so I gave up after returning the second one 
 I mistakenly believed the hype that this thing would PROTECT my computer from BEING KILLED, but instead, this thing has KILLED my computer FOR THE SECOND TIME IN 4 DAYS, EMITTING AN UN-STOPPABLE(i.e., CAN'T TURN THE FEATURE OFF) SHRIEK ALARM. How do smart, talented people idiotically convince themselves that a home product should have an ear-piercing shriek-alarm that can't be defeated / silenced?  In addition to doing far, far more damage than it can ever prevent, ask yourself -- do you want this un-stoppable ear-piercing shriek alarm going off in your house at 2a.m.? I BOUGHT ONE APC PRODUCT, AND SO FAR, THEY'RE 100% DEFECTIVE AND 100% DELITERIOUS TO THE USE OF MY COMPUTER & IT'S A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE IT'S DELITERIOUS TO MY SLEEP. 
 The Butcher (Edward Gorsuch, 2006)  And here we have, yes, another young-and-beautifuls-go-to-an-old-scary-house-and-get-massacred movie. Bad acting. Increasingly-common variation on old horror movie rule (instead of straight kids having sex, there's a pair of lesbians, who must, of course, suffer gruesome ends-- this isn't a spoiler, as the first occurs in the extended opening scene. So the lesbian must die even before they encounter the guy who does the massacring. Silly, anyone?). Awful, awful script. Incredibly predictable plot twist. Yeah, there's really nothing good to say about this movie. Some wag on the IMDB boards called it (forgive my paraphrasing) a bad remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre combined with a bad remake of The People Under the Stairs, and he's right.  
 Theory wise, the book exposes things relatively well.  However, I cannot get over how thoroughly maddening it is to be second-guessing the answers in the back of the book when you're trying to learn by doing.  For ...sake, it's the 3rd edition and it's still full of errors!  Inexcusable!  There's no way to build confidence in problem solving when many of the solutions to the odd numbered problems are wrong!  No matter how clear the theory, it's still a work in progress, incomplete at best.  It is, quite frankly, shameful to be passing this book off as some sort of learning tool 
 INEXCUSABLE was, at best, a deceint read.  The character reminded me a lot of a very good friend, in the aspect that the story character (Keir) and my friend both are 'good guys.'  But unfortunetly Keir's world is not that believeable.  The author portrays a close-knit family relationship, but Keir often talks about leaving his family. It's almost like a personality order, going from loving to hatred in seconds (or pages.)  His father seems like a great guy, but then he lets his son go get smashed and do bad stuff with the football team.  The sisters seem odd, but a good part of the family, but their role is only for conflict.  Either the author doesn't correctly set the tone of this family or I mis-interpreted.  Keir often bugged me, and not the realistic, his mood makes him more believeable way.  His sister's bugged me, his crush very very much bugged me.  If Gigi (crush) and Keir were sooo close together (as if often says, childhood friends, ya da), then why did it turn out the way it did? Many characters were flat and there were to many way-ward emotions.  The tone changed every five seconds. Along with the bad, there is good. It was easy to read and short, and did bring up some good points about peer-pressure.  I suppose it's worth the read, but only from the library 
 Maybe some short stories in this book are worth reading, but I couldn't get to them - I tried the first 5 or 6, and they were very amateur and cliche.  Just because an author uses the word "Cthulhu" doesn't mean it's good - the stories still need to work as stories.  
 This book, and it's companion, The New Big Book of America, are written from an extremely liberal and politically correct point of view.  The authors bend over backwards to make the white colonists and Presidents appear as arrogant, indifferent, and overbearing in regards to everyone who is not a white male.  Each President's page is around 50% about the President's actual achievements, and around 50% about the current Native American, Women's suffrage, and Civil Rights issues of the day.  These authors have an agenda, and it comes across very clear.  If you want your child influenced by this politically correct revisionist history, then be sure to pick this one up 
 This product did a terrible job of grinding and produced very inconsistant pepper grinds.  In addition, it was very hard to keep peppricorns fed into the grinder without going forwards and backwards with the crank.  
 Zukav has a decidedly anti-Western tone and is obviously biased in favor of oriental thinking.  This is new age gobbledegook passed off as a bare bones reader on physics.  Rather than writing a laconic outline of physics, Zukav spends the majority of his time praising Eastern thought and toying with the idea that everything is subjective.    The reader is referred to any college physics textbook or Isaac Asimov's History of Physics or a good set of encylopedias.   
 I love Journey, but only with Steve Perry!  Yes, Journey was around before Steve Perry but S.P. had that special magic and the band was a huge success.  Steve A. tries to sound like Perry but it can't be done.  They haven't made it really big with Steve A.  Van Halen had two different lead singers and they were both totally different from one another.  Their voices were different, their style of songs were different, their image was different and Van Halen was so popular with both lead singers. It is totally fine if a band wants to get another lead singer, just don't try to sound like the previous one by voice or style of music.  Steve Perry had the whole package.  His stage presence was awesome and his voice is the greatest.  You really don't hear about the (new) Journey with Steve A.  You don't really hear them on the radio, see them on t.v. or anything!! Steve Perry was the best and if he would ever go back with the band, they'd be a hit all over again.  I didn't like this CD at all.  None of the songs made an impact on me.  
 Lawyer Ronnie Jinkowsky finds herself a pawn in her grandfather's latest sea salvage scheme in search of an elusive pink diamond necklace. He's been hired by a woman with mob ties. Along for the ride are a couple of sexy divers and her four-time ex-husband Jake. What she does not realize is the ruse with which she was summoned (her grandpa's sudden decline in wealth) is a lie to bring her together with Jake for hopefully a fifth outing.  Also along for the ride is grating cajun Tante Lulu, from Hill's cowboy series of books. Equal parts inane and annoying, she adds nothing to the story, other than to dissect and destroy the English language. The rest of the characters are childish and not particularly fleshed out, the dialog at times trite, the romance pretty lukewarm, and the overall storyline is stale. If this is indicative of the caliber of writing for the rest of a new series, you can count me out on any further Jinx adventures 
 I heard all of these great things about this book etc...... So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. The "bowel movement" chapter was totally repulsive. I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book 
 Like most people, I loved the original Friday - a true classic. I had heard that this one wasn't as good, so I rented a copy just to check it out for myself.  This movie is straight-up garbage. Mike Epps can't carry Chris Tucker's jock. What a waste of what could have been a very good movie series.  Stick with the original; don't waste your time or money on this one 
 It's more grown up than her previous albums in bad way.  I can't play a few of the songs with my kids around.  While the inappropriate songs may be catchy, it's disappointing that they had to be so "give it to me".  It's also missing the "rap/yodeling/soul" stuff that made me like her so much in the first album 
 Glenn Miller once wrote "Onion Breath where are you over?" and String of Pearls.  This book had one flaws in it.  Zero gravity.  After spicy food it can't fart and it can keep it bottled up all the day because a girl is sitting near him in school.  He wants to score because he's a soccer player with no return.  Ottoman Berkley and some friends have somewhat a good idea how to feel about his coming to change.  J.D. Salinger wrote that on parchment and vitally grew with no limit in sight.  Why didn't this book talk about kids in the Middle Ages.  I want to read a book like that.  Some kids know how easy it is to be fun to talk and sing to after dinner.  Speakers in the earway of oui oui is sensible to adolescents.  All in all, good. Stick a fork in me 'cause I'm done 
 I'm not sure what's with all the 5-star reviews for Bad Haircut.  I did find it mildly amusing.  Nothing seemed too laugh out loud hilarious though.  It's more of a chuckler, with some nice memories thrown in.  After awhile though, all of the stories and themes started blending together a little too much.  Too many stories seemed like stories I had read a few chapters ago.    And lastly, the stories often end abruptly without any sort of ending.  Period.  End of story.  Bad Haircut was a nice, quick easy read though, but after awhile, it lost my interest.  Tom Perotta may be better as a novelist, but I don't think I'll read him again to find out 
 I must confess I have never read Nora Roberts in my life, so I hate to judge her by just one book.  My mother read this, and kept telling me about it while she was reading it, and couldn't wait for me to read it.  Not being a fan of romance novels, I just totally skipped the blossoming romance between Stella and Logan, because it just seemed typical "romance" stuff.  The rest of the novel just never went anywhere for me.  I never really developed a love for the characters, and the description of Memphis never made me feel that I was there.  Come on - mentioning Graceland and the Peabody - were they supposed to be the token landmarks that make a reader say "o.k. I'm in Memphis".  The author could have just as easily had them visit the Sears Tower and Field Museum, and "poof" they're in Chicago! The ghost aspect had so much potential that never went anywhere either.  I'm a big fan of historical fiction, and if the author had delved into the research the characters did to discover who the ghost was, maybe even adding a few flashbacks of the period when Amelia lived, that would have helped.  The prologue introducing Amelia just didn't flesh her out enough for the reader to invest much in her.  I know that Nora Roberts is a best-selling author, but after reading this, I'm wondering who reads all those books, and keeps buying more?  I have NO interest in getting the next two books in this trilogy.  Haven't had the heart to tell my Mom how much I didn't enjoy it though.  Sorry, I just didn't care for it at all.  It seemed a little amateurish even.  cj 
 I have gone thru 2 of these sets i am returning the 2nd one for repair. I bought it stictly as a monitor for my computer, On the first tv none of the 2 dvi inputs would work. All I got was " No signal". I was sent another set and it has the exact problem again. Seems odd 2 tvs would both have  both DVI inputs not working. I have tried 2 computers and 3 cables in various combinations with no success. All combinations work with another monitor just fine. The only way I get any picture is to hook up the vga input. At that point I can get the 1920 x 1080 resolution, but only at 30mhz. If I select 60 mhz the tv says it's out of range.  Sure I could run the vga input, But I bought a new computer, upgraded graphis card w/ dual dvi output, stand, etc just so I could run this monitor at 1080p and can't. Now I've just read Consumer reports and they report the DVI inputs will not work at 1080p from a dvi source such as a computer. What the hell? Why wasn't this mentioned by westinghouse. This TV is sold as a monitor as there is no built in tuner and can't even work as one. I've had it for about10 months and still haven't been able to use it. This was for work use so the $2000 I spent has been pretty useless. Of course it a lower price now and I wouldn't care as long as I got my usage out of it. Instead I have spent many days with westinghouse tech support telling me conflicting things, telling me my computer was bad, my graphics card was bad, I had the wrong cables, etc. not returning calls, buying and trying everything I could to get it to work as per their advice. obviously there is either a bit of false advertising,or a lot of faulty units floating around. I picked this set for its price and the fact that Best Buy said I would get the best image quality with this set and upgrading my computers to accomdate it's ability to use DVI. I will be buying a 50+ LCD soon and unless westinghouse comes thru, I won't buy another 
 I have read all of Sandra Brown books. I was disappointed in this one. I have almost all of her books in my bookcase, but when I finished this one I gave it away.  
 Too salty for me, there is a better brand out there 
 **1/2  When it was released in 1967, "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" was acclaimed as a "breakthrough" film for its lighthearted, yet serious, depiction of an interracial romance.  In the years since, society has moved so far in the direction of acceptance of so-called "mixed marriages" that any remake is bound to feel, at least to some extent, superfluous and anachronistic.  And that is exactly the case with "Guess Who," a 2005 update whose abbreviated title is only the first of the many changes the filmmakers have rung on the Stanley Kramer original.  The screenwriters' first alteration involves switching the race roles, so that it is now a black family having to accept a white male as a prospective in-law rather than the other way around.  Bernie Mac assumes the Spencer Tracy role as the father whose world is turned upside down when his beloved daughter brings a Caucasian boyfriend (Ashton Kutcher as a white Sidney Poitier) home to meet the family.  On the distaff side, we have Judith Scott taking over for Katherine Hepburn as the understanding mother and Zoe Saldana replacing Katherine Houghton as the freethinking daughter.  Since interracial marriage is no longer the hot-button issue it once was, the filmmakers have been forced to inject a number of other non-race-related plot complications into the mix to develop and maintain the conflict and drama.  Thus, we have Kutcher trying to hide the fact from both his fiance and her family that he has recently quit his high-paying job at a prestigious firm and that he may, in fact, be the target of a securities-and-exchange commission probe.  Indeed, with Kutcher spending most of his time trying to win over his critical and overbearing future father-in-law, "Guess Who" feels more like a remake of "Meet the Parents" than of "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner."  The real problem with "Guess Who" is that it rarely has the courage of its convictions.  Having decided to tackle a relatively dicey topic, the film too often drops the issue in favor of scenes that wouldn't pass muster even on a third-rate sitcom.  For every scene that is incisive and daring - i.e. Kutcher telling a series of black jokes at the family dinner table - there is another that is pure Hollywood hokum (Mac and Kutcher sleeping in the same bed together, Mac and Kutcher having a go-cart race to determine who has the higher testosterone level and the greater machismo, etc.).    All of the performers are fine, especially Mac and Kutcher in the lead roles.  However, they just haven`t been given very sophisticated material to work with here.  "Guess Who" might have been a better film had it aimed more for genuine, hard-edged satire and less for lowbrow slapstick and predictable romantic comedy sentimentality.    Still, it's been 38 years since "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" first shocked the nation with its in-your-face defiance of miscegenation laws, and the world has since moved on to other issues of social injustice and marital definition.  Which is why, in the year 2005, "Brokeback Mountain" was a breakthrough film and "Guess Who" was not 
 I can't believe people are actually raving about this book. I was so offended by the inappropriate language that I could not possibly enjoy the experience of reading the story. The main character is acting like she is 3, rather than 32. This is hardly destined to be a classic and I would not recommend it to anyone who has any literary taste. 
 Although the announcement makes you think that maybe yo will be getting 20 books for a song, you will be singing a different tune when it arrives.  You will get one (yes, 1) volume selected apparently at random.  I got volume 13 
 Parody, spoof, satire, prank, hoax, send-up, take-off, lampoon, jest, joke...call it whatever you want, but Return to Horror High (1987) is still a dog...and not a very original one at that, as the film brought to mind the movie Happy Birthday to Me (1981), which, comparatively, was modestly better.  That's not to say Return to Horror High couldn't have been more than it was, but it would have taken a whole lot of work to turn it around.  The film actually lists four writers, one of them being Bill Froehlich ("Freddy's Nightmares"), who was also the director, this being his first (and only) film.  Appearing is a number of actors I'm not familiar with like Brendan Hughes (Howling VI: The Freaks), Lori Lethin (Bloody Birthday), and Richard Brestoff (Car Wash), along with a few that I have heard of, like George Clooney (Welcome to Collinwood), Vince Edwards ("Ben Casey"), Alex Rocco (Detroit 9000), and Maureen McCormick, probably most known for her role as Marcia Brady on "The Brady Bunch" television series, but has had something of a career afterwards appearing in films like Dogtown (1997), The Million Dollar Kid (2000), and Title to Murder (2001), none of which I've actually seen, but they're out there.  At the outset some text is displayed on the screen stating that in 1982, a series of brutal, savage murders occurred at Crippen High School, and the homicidal maniac responsible was never caught.  Flash forward to the present (I'm assuming the present being 1987, as that's when the film was released) and we learn a film crew is now occupying the since abandoned school with the intent on shooting a movie about the grisly events.  The low budget production has its problems, flighty actors, creative differences between the director and producer, etc., but what no one counted on was that the killer who struck so long ago may still be around...after the disappearance of a few crew members (hardly noticed by anyone..."Say, where's that grip?  What his name?"), lead actress Callie Cassidy (Lethin) and policeman/technical advisor turned lead actor (after the male lead left for a better part) Steven Blake (Hughes) become suspicious enough to suspect perhaps there is a malevolent force stalking the halls of Crippen High, an evil that's been waiting patiently these many years for some fresh blood...what gruesome secrets are stashed away within the bowels of the school?  Will you care?   First of all, it should be noted this isn't really a horror movie in the conventional sense, but an attempt at a comedy poking fun at the genre.  As far as what I actually liked about the film, it wasn't much...I liked Alex Rocco's portrayal of the stereotypical, slightly sleazy, manipulative, condescending, two-faced, backstabbing movie producer Harry Sleerik who was more concerned with the elements the would sell a low budget horror film, specifically buckets of blood and lots of boobage, much to the chagrin of the director who fancies himself a junior Hitchcock of sorts, constantly perturbed at thoughts of having to compromise his artistic integrity for the sake of appealing to, in his eyes, the lowest common denominator...the sequence where Sleerik actually disrupts filming of a scene of the film within the film by grabbing the lead actresses chest, claiming something to the effect of `we need more of this' was really pretty funny.  Also, Vince Edwards was pretty good in his role as an actor playing the role of lecherous biology teacher named Mr. Birnbaum ("Mr. Birnbaum, why am I getting a C when I used to get A's? ", "Have you looked in the mirror lately?")  And that was really about it...there were perhaps a few more humorous moments, but nothing that stands out in my mind (and I only watched the thing last night).  The biggest problem with this movie, in my opinion, is something I believe someone else already brought up, specifically the convoluted nature of the story.  I think the intent was to blend the material in such a way as so it would be difficult for the viewer to discern what was actually the movie, and what was the movie within the movie.  The story begins sort of at the end, after most of the crew has been murderlated, and then flashes back to how the events came about.  This goes on constantly, along with the mixing of realities of the story with that of story of the film within the film...sound confusing?  Try watching it...throw in a dream sequence and what you have is a muddled mess, which lost my interest about halfway through.  Perhaps the material and how it would go down was clear in the director's mind, but I felt he got just a little to cutesy with it, especially this being his first film.  I can't really fault someone for taking a risk, trying to push the boundaries and break from the norm, but such a seemingly complex conceptualization, if not handled properly, will most certainly crash and burn, spectacularly, I might add.  I went into this blindly, assuming it was a straight up horror film, but eventually realized otherwise, but it did take awhile, as the comedic aspects were often subtle enough to make me question if the characters were parodies, or just being stupid (the latter not an uncommon occurrence in a lot of the slasher flicks of the early 80s).  Overall the acting was just this side of passable (other than the aforementioned performances by Rocco and Edwards), but I suppose someone would say that was also intentional due to the satirical nature of the material, but I'm not buying, as I've seen other parodies with much better performances.  I guess the gist of what I'm getting at is by the time this film was released, the slasher/horror genre had grown somewhat stale, even to the point where parodies of the genre had even become tired, but then that's just my opinion.    Anchor Bay Entertainment, as usual, provides an excellent looking widescreen (1.85:1) print transfer on this DVD, along with a clear and audible Dolby Digital 2,0 Mono audio track.  I was surprised at the lack of extras, as all that's included is a theatrical trailer along with a 5X7 reproduction of original poster art on a card within the DVD case, the flipside listing the chapter stops.

 ...clearly an argument that displays first a loyalty to a specific outcome, and then seeks a way to get there.    Rauch does well not to demonize the opposition, who, certainly, can be their own worst enemies when it comes to debating the issue, trotting out canned phrases like "family values," and "the sanctity of marriage."    Nevertheless, his assertion that allowing gays to marry will strengthen the instution misses the point entirely.  First of all, he rightly recognizes that marriage is not just a religious institution, it is a social one.  By legalizing gay marriage--and even civil unions--you are forcing people not only to accept, but to endorse behavior that they find abnormal and morally abhorrent.  Like it or not, marriage is, by definition, the union of a man and a woman; it has never been anything else, until very recently in those mercifully few countries that have legalized it.  Dismissing this fact as a reactionary loyalty to tradition doesn't change it.    Gay marriage probably won't weak the instution of marriage as a whole--it is on shaky legs as it is--but it certainly won't help it.  The state regulates marriage as it is--we are NOT free to marry whomever we want, and just because we might want to badly, that doesn't make it our right.  It is government's job to protect the interests of its citizens, and clearly citizens feel they have a very strong interest in NOT redefining marriage.  And in fact, gays do have the same rights as the rest of us, contrary to what Mr. Rauch suggests.  Gays are free to marry a member of the opposite sex, within the boundaries set by law.  That they don't want to is hardly society's fault, and hardly a reason to change a fundamental social institution, just to satisfy their desires.  His arguments that gay marriage is not a slippery slope remain unconvincing.  If objective values like tradition are so easily discarded to accomodate a small minority of malcontents, then what logical reasons can there be not to accomodate other malcontents? Does this mean that we can realistically expect people to petition to marry their dogs?  Of course not.  But is there really a compelling argument, then, for continuing to outlaw polygamy?  No.  I agree with Rauch regarding leaving the argument to legislators rather than the judiciary.  Most Americans despise the idea of having a judiciary shove its values down our throats, and this more than anything is probably what has given traction to the anti's position.  As a matter of strategy, it's bad for gays; as a matter of policy, it's bad for America.   
 I had read the book Black Thorn White rose before picking up this anthology and had a lot of hopes for this book. I love the retelling of fairy tales even with a dark twist to them. However, some of the stories in this book are absolutely horrific. The Match Girl, in my opinion, does not belong in a collection of fantasy but instead perhaps in one of horror. Its been a week since I read this book and I still have a bad taste left from it 
 Schaeffer has a few valid points that could be developed into strong arguments to support his thesis, yet he fails to organize his thoughts and he does not substantiate his claims with concrete examples. This book needs strong editing and perhaps the ranting could be turned down a few notches as well 
 I saw the TV show made, so I wanted to check out the full story.  It was a disappointment, but my wife loved it. So there you are one against, one for it 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 This novel was quite possibly one of the worst I have ever read.  Poorly written, and grammaticly hard to swallow, Davis' arguements are hard to see through all the philosophical "crap" he presents.  Davis paints of a picture of government conspiracy, and proposes a solution of anarchy and social equality (which he then goes on to contradict, because apparently there can be no equality).  Disability is a serious issue,and should be treated as such.  Davis makes a mockery of these people and their struggle, and should be tarred and feathered.  Davis, here is my message to you: Please do not write anymore...you are not a scholar, an expert, or a professional for that matter.  Move on and stop feeding America your radical ideas 
 Ugh!  Never having heard of the author or his other books, this is the first book I've bought solely on the strength of Amazon's  "Recommended for" list.  I'm disappointed both by the book itself and by Amazon's flawed ability to suggest books.  To be fair, The Amateur has all the elements of thrillers I enjoy:  foreign travel, word play, conspiracy theory, a parallel body of knowledge about which the reader can learn while following the main plot.  But it's dull.  The lines set up to sound world-weary or self-deprecating sound simply smug, depressingly self-satisfied.  Heller, the main character, has all the quirky tics of a Spenser or a Reacher, but none of the depth.  (Yes, even Parker's Spenser has depth compared to the hero of Littell's yarn.)  It' s as though Littell can't be bothered with back-story or background, trying instead to telegraph the results of a life experience with references to "his Mona Lisa smile" and the begging, sniffing, and returning of cigarettes.  Best line:  a remembered message home from young Heller miserable at summer camp:  "everyone here goes around in twos;  I go around in ones."  We do get a brief glimpse into the bizarre, self- aggrandizing, vanity press micro-world of "Shakespeare didn't write those plays."  But the self-absorbed and classist men (only men, of course) who burrow away to prove that no one without a title could have produced Shakespeare's canon are ultimately as boring as the rest of the book.  Littell writes good minor characters - Mr Diamond, Uncle Ludvic --  but one can't help wondering if that's because he doesn't need to sustain them.  Elizabeth is his best character, the only woman who gets more than a line or two.  Toward the end, however, she becomes yet another superficial cipher in the service of Heller's revenge saga.  As for the plot, Littell may deserve a prize for the most sustained series of coincidences in a spy novel.  There's virtually nothing else moving things forward -- certainly not the dialogue, which is both tedious and brief.  Over-all judgment?  Big yawn.  Spend your money on Daniel Silva - great writing, compelling characters, complex plots leading to the heart of varied darknesses and back again 
 Has everything:  a remarkable true story of a determined hero and the love of family in making his accomplishment even more special.  It makes you want to applaud his courage in many scenes, especially when he succeeds an incredibly painful test to stun his supervisory review board, winning their applaud as well.  This is a don't miss story told by tremendous acting throughout...20 star performances!  Thank you for sending me a copy.  -  
 This is one of three Iris Murdoch books I have read, as a good friend of mine is a big fan. I have yet to see why. I found Nuns and Soldiers silly and overwrought, an extended but inexplicable love story filled with  improbable and self conscious conversations. Do people experiencing a coup  de foudre really sit around and dissect their feelings? I don't find the  philosophical or moral underpinnings of the story to be compelling, either.  Social requirements versus individual desire, I guess 
 I think that this book isn't even worth READING. The recipes are repulsive, and I don't even think that they help you lose wait. The only thing that realy works in my experience is eating right and regular exercis 
 That this book is receiving one star, given the title of my review, should surprise no one.  Look, say what you will; I am a classically trained, analytic, Anglophone philosopher with a penchant for clarity and rigor.  That is where I stand.  If you are looking for a text which purports to be theoretical, and yet is obviously densely literary and aphoristic, perhaps I don't understand what you're on about, and perhaps you don't either.  This book is neither clear nor rigorous.  Where it doesn't mutate truly elementary understandings of science (not to say that either Deleuze understands what the difference between science and pseudoscience is), psychology, and economics to suit its incoherent purposes, it avoids any understanding whatsoever.  The philosophical work contained herein is non-starting.  That is, it is not philosophy, as it is neither argumentative, interpretive, nor logical.  There are no discernible conclusions (which is not to say that there are none in this pig latin dog's dinner, but they probably aren't deduced from premisses ) where there is anything like 'argument' at all.  To say that I'm missing the point, you'd first have to show that such work can have a point.  That it violates hard-won conventions of philosophical discourse, which are taken as primitive (I can't tell you how many times the Law of Excluded Middle was violated), is not a victory for this work.  It is a setback.  That it has not been translated into English, but rather some retarded cousin of English, is perhaps partly to blame for my lack of understanding.  I tend only to be able to read natural languages.  But then, again, perhaps my rhizomatic foreshortening (to wit: to SHORTEN is also to LENGTHEN) is in part quasiculpable (that is, retrodogmatically) as a blamematic(viz. contraposto) which tends inter alia to produce (and re-produce, as Malreaux reads Sartre in referential milieus of Darwinian technologies of traffic control) my congnitive disfunctionabilities.  I recommend the work of W.V.O. Quine if you're looking for a 'philosophy of our time,' as one reviewer suggested we must 
 One of those unique books where professional writers openly discuss their personal decisions on family and children. Interesting take is that they have all made decision and stuck with it in regards to whether or not to have children.  Neither one of them seems to regret their decision and is firmly behind it.  While some writings are more impressive than others, they all have in common he fact that they are sincere and open 
 Having worked in the mental health community for sometime, I was already familiar with this technique and have been using it already.  I felt the book was really droll and somewhat condescending in tone.  I wouldn't purchase it again.  His companion book "Why Employees Don't Do What They're Supposed to Do and What to Do about It" is a more practical read and enjoyable too--I would recommend that one 
 This book is somewhat helpful but hopelessly outdated. Ukraine is changing rapidly and this book just is not of much use at all! See if you can buy it used, but don't waste your money on a new copy 
 "The Third Sister", a Sense & Sensibility sequel, treads shallow waters, compromising between the two Barret `extremes' by being sufficiently plotted, but dull and predictable. Margaret, miraculously transformed into a fine, intelligent young lady (one has the impression that Barret watched Emma Thompson's film, which included a lively, appealing child Margaret) has to choose between two young men, one resembling Edward Ferrars in his reserve and quiet demeanor, the other resembling Willoughby in his good looks and `liveliness'. Unpredictably-or is it with complete predictability?- they are neither what Margaret thinks they are. And they are both shallow characters, very much like Margaret. There is very little emotional development and resonance between either and Margaret.  The language is just barely adequate, the events so unmemorable that I can just recall the skeleton of the plot relating to Margaret after 2 years of reading the book. If you must read something else by Barret, read "Presumption". If you wish for an excellent Austen sequel, read "Sanditon", completed by Marie Dobbs 
 Oh, please SPARE US the histrionics, Sanchez! Sanchez was only peripherially involved with the Stones about the time Brian got screwy & died, and then on the '69 tour...as "security."  Yeah, that's him in "Gimmie Shelter," when Mick and Keith are dancing around in their hotel room to "Brown Sugar" - he's the one that scowls so prettily when one of the Maysles sticks a light meter in his face. HA-ha: if THIS twit was responsible for "security," we all oughta be grateful that it was only Meredith Hunter that got snuffed at Altamont. This pedantic "book" reads something like a bad Beavis & Butthead fantasy, i.e, "well, then Keith got high, so I made it with ----(Marianne, Anita, take your pick)" Man, your fifteen minutes are LONG GONE with that vignette in "Gimmie Shelter."  Go whine some more to your fellow sufferers in rehab or something...we've read ALL these silly little stories by third-rate hangers-on before!  And in most cases, MUCH better, more coherently written, too 
 If you love well written stories, great plots and captivating acting then this movie IS NOT for you.  I don't know how the producer managed to swindle precious investor dollars to get this tripe made into a movie, however there it is!  It was SO BORING and so badly done that after the first 1 hour and 45 minutes I had to turn it off. I don't even want to know how it ended.  The cast line up was great! That's the only 'positive' comment I can make with regards to this movie.  DO NOT watch it. DO NOT hire it. DO NOT believe anybody who thinks it is good.  The two lesbians who made love even did that scene poorly; get this, it was done in the missionary position!  Avoid this movie 
 Yo.  Don't even do it.  The Worst Ever.  Ever.  You don't have to do this to yourself.  Take your cash and throw it out your window...The First album and the EP,  they're ok.  This is a pile of poop 
 For all you aspiring artist out there SAVE YOUR MONEY. This book does little to further any critical thought about the contemporary art world. The book is limited in the mediums represented, and seems more to be a platform for Linda Weintraub to promote artists that appeal to her than to critically discuss the issues aspiring artists face 
 I remove children from abusive parents daily.  Legally, you cannot hit your child with anything but your open hand on any area but your child's buttocks.  If a neighbor, friend, teacher or family member calls Child and Family Services because your child reports to them that you are doing what Dr. Dobson advocates, your child could be removed from your care.  
 If you are a programmer and in a hurry to implement your own graphics filter then don't buy this book.  Its treament of the various formats is essentially devoid of any examples and detail.  A very superficial book with large fonts a "buttons" fulfilling the need to ensure bulk to the book at the expense of content.  There is no CD with example coding and decoding examples, very very few tables of giving a graphical view of the file structures.   In short it is a poorly presented and poorly written book...hardly worth $10 rather than the $25 they are asking....Go by the O'Reilly book Encyclopaedia of Graphics Formats...expensive for sure but it has what this book lacks and that is content 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 The Fridays gang steals some diamonds.  Mike Epps is not Chris Tucker no matter how hard he tries to be.  His constant whinning is enough to ride my last nerve.  Plus, everything about the movie is just campy and just wholly unbelieveable that I don't know where to begin.  Whatever you do don't buy or rent this garbage-wait to catch it on TBS or something 
 Mere Christianity is a book often recommended to atheists by Christians and is touted as a rational, logical case for the Christian religion. Unfortunately, well-informed atheists will find that Lewis quickly uses a god of the gaps argument to explain his concept of Moral Law. Lewis's Moral Law argument will not fool anyone with a basic understanding of social evolution. All cultures have some prohibition against stealing and murder as well as some glorification of selflessness and compassion, but this is due not to a Lawgiver but to social evolution. The reason we have these moral characteristics is because they helped us to survive. Any tribe of humans who permitted murder or glorified betrayal would fall apart and die out quickly.  A warning to all atheists who pick up this book: Don't bother reading past Book 1. The Moral Law is the keystone of Lewis's argument. Without it, everything else he says is meaningless to atheists 
 The rhythms in this music are so monotonous, songs go on and on and on, with no direction, as if the songwriter didn't know how to end the song.  Very disappointed in this because an intelligent person recommended this album and I expected much much better.     Just a bunch of over-drugged and over-sexed punks, no role models here!    I don't recomend you buy this one.   
 As one that couldn't stand NBA Ballers, I thought I would give this game a try.  Pros:  create a baller Nice graphics Cons:  Defense? If you are a fan of Pheonix Sun basketball, you will love this game  The announcer needs to learn ENGLISH The whole "I-Ball Trick Stick" is horrible and will have you sreaming as you're stuck on the second side game that is required before you can advance on And 1 tour That stupid mic trick that allows you to score 4 points with one shot Stupid Watch This Trick that you can't stop despite the fact that you can still move your player. You can't even block! You can not choose who you want to face in other game modes unless you are playing two player.   Guess which game I'll be trading for NBA Live 2007 or WWE Smackdown vs Raw 2007 this fall?   
 This appears to have been written by a Java evangelist who loves to talk shop about the ins & outs of Java programming. Unfortunately, this is supposed to be about game programming, and in that regard, I found nothing practical about it. A single chapter on 2D graphics? This book goes into great depth providing the mathematics of 3D collision detection (chapter 16), but doesn't get any further in the graphics department than drawing a few static (non-animated) Actors (i.e. "sprites").   The focus of this book is off-point from the start, in my opinion. The chapters toward the end on 3D graphics provide insufficient information to build a 3D game, and yet the material up to that point is insufficient to build a 2D game. What you end up with in the end is a lot of knowledge about Java, but not a single practical program, let alone game.   This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the CD includes .java and .class files, but no explanation on what to do with them (the back cover does say this is a Beginning-Intermediate book, not Advanced).   The Java Developer's Kit comes with much better demos than you will find in this book WITH convenient .html files with code to run the applets, which is something these authors should have included 
 I ordered two of these and returned them the day they arrived.  If you are ordering this product make sure you know what you are getting.  This is an "MP3" player, not an MP3 player.  It doesn't play real music.  You can organize 100 songs that are preloaded onto the music player to make play lists.  I should have known it was too good to be true with the price.  Cute for a toddler who isn't yet interested in "real" music 
 If you are thinking about buying this CD, I'm betting it is because you heard "100 years" on the radio and you thought it was such a great song, you wanted to check out what else John Ondrasik or Five For Fighting was capable of. Let me save you the trouble, the answer is not much. This CD is unbelievably dull, surprisingly vulgar at times given the theme and context of the hit single, and really just poorly constructed. Just because you enjoyed "100 Years" or even "Superman" which are both very good songs, don't be fooled into thinking you might like the rest of the albums. There is a reason that you only hear one hit single from each of FFF's albums, the other songs just aren't worth the listen. Really, very dissapointing 
 Graphics aren't bad, maps are fairly accurate and the same goes for the turn-by-turn instuctions. There are, however, a LOT of flies in the ointment:  First and foremost - very week ability to detect satellites. The unit loses contact frequently and takes an inordinate amount of time to relocate them. The slightest hint of clouds make this process take even longer.  Second, VERY puny CPU. It's calculations are excutiatingly slow. So if you try to get the unit to set a route that's longer than, say, 75 miles you may be done with a big chunk of the trip before the GPS actually completes the calculation. And, of course, once the original calculation is completed, your current position is no longer the position the calculation is based on, and the process of recalculation starts all over again... Very frustrating, unless you are on a relatively short trip.  Third, it does have a built-in mp3 player but it might as well not have it. The sound is pretty bad. And if, heaven forbid, you try to play music while it's in the process of making ANY calculation whatsoever, the sound gets worse and the calculation gets much slower.  All in all, it's better than no GPS but the price differential between this and the better units (I have an older Garmin StreetPilot unit with which I'm very happy) is not enough to justify the purchase 
 Mr. Conroy's idolization of the Colonel is obvious, but the book is slow moving, hard to follow and definitely hid his literary genius to be shared with us in his later writings 
 My title says it all. I don't know what I expected this book to be, but I do know I was disappointed in reading it. It was dull, uninspired, and it seemed that the author was just putting things down without regard to the pleasure (or lack of pleasure) of the reader. The book was largely devoid of attitude or any sort of what-it-all-means, which is the "what" we read books for. If you just want a bald recitation of a lot of facts, buy this book. If you are looking for meaning, insight, or entertainment - FORGET IT! My suggestion: Find the same data in another book 
 What movie was every one else watching?  Certainly not this one.  Very, very, slow.  Disjointed story line.  I hate to be a bore but this was boring.  Enjoy 
 The first twenty pages of the book quickly sparks your interest but soon after that, the story drags until it picks back up again toward the last third of the book.  I think the story would have been more credible if Barr would have thoroughly explored the inner workings of her fictional religious sect and offered more details about it.  Without those details, the book seemed "unfinished".  It was like watching a movie and only viewing the actions of the good guy without being exposed to villain.  Boring in my opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                            
 I read the reviews and thought I'd buy the table anyway and hopefully be lucky. Well I wasn't, a corner of it was damaged and the paint chipped. I covered it with a wood finish pen and it doesn't look all that bad. I'm definitly not ordering any other furniture though 
 I was, overall, disappointed by this CD.  There are many good reviews here, but they generally overpraise.  Tracks 4 through 8 have too much synthesizer for my ears.  A major highlight is track 9, The Crab and the Egret, but interestingly, the flute is accompaniment to the wondrous Chinese percussion.  Disappointingly, the CD is only 40 minutes long and left me wanting more tunes without synthesizer accompaniment 
 I bought PC-Cillin because it has 4 stars in Amazon rating, which is much better than McAfee and Norton. But I am wrong. Before installed PC-Cillin, everything is fine. But after installed, I can not access my yahoo email. After calling customer service two times, even uninstalled PC-Cillin, I still can not access yahoo email. Now I have to re-install Windows XP. It will cost me a lot of time. Anyone knows what wrong is 
 I expected much better quality from Thule. As used according to the manufacturers recomendations, this bag did not even last one trip from New York to Chicago without it's interior lining cracking and completely flaking off. In addition, the back of the bag ripped creating two large holes in the fabric and the zipper attachments became loose and proceeded to pound at the roof of my car. The contents shifted continually during travel making for a loud noise that's not unlike a pouring rain hitting the top of the car. This becomes a terrible distraction while driving. All in all I had a very bad experience with this product and would not reccomend it. Opt for one of the solid constuction type carriers, they cost much more, but are worth every penny. In the end I thought I was saving money with this product but wound up having to purchase a Sears X-Cargo container to replace it for my return trip back. 
 Before I get to the CD itself, right now Amazon pairs this album with the Charlie Brown Christmas CD.  It must be because Weller looks like he is wearing a Christmas sweater! Ha, ha, ha, ha! There are not many US released Style Council CDs around these days.  You should snatch this up right away.  It has, um, a handful of their hits, and a couple of their not-worst songs. Minus 1 star for the bizarro track listing. Minus 1 star for a live version of "Call Me."  It should have been the demo version.  (The "real" version stinks!) Minus 1 star because it is only their pop songs and they did some really decent cod jazz in their day. Minus 1 star for not including anything on their last three albums, and by that I mean they only include singles and stuff from their first two albums.  Their later music is their most interesting.  Confessions of a Pop Group is Weller's most under-rated album ever! So there you go- 1 star left, but this is the best 1 star CD I've ever reviewed 
 I read a book called The Whipping Boy. It  was not very good.  This story is about a prince who has a few problems. He is always gets in to trouble. Since the prince can never get hit, they have a whipping boy to get hit for him. The whipping boy gets hit about three to four times a day. The whipping boy's name is Jemmy. The prince's name is Brat. Jemmy and Prince Brat run away and get into a lot of trouble.  It was vary confusing and hard to keep up with. My mind was drifting around. I would give this book a 1 out of 5 because it was not very good. It was kind of stupid.  The only way you would be able to like this book is if you like stupid books. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It seems like a good book from the cover. The first few chapters are good. But then it gets really boring. After every chapter it got really confusing 
 I read the other review about this book. I dont understand how reader enjoy the book. its boring, many twisted plots is unnessery, the end is little surpising but not convincing at all. I read the book 10 days and I just wait to see where the book will become interesting- its not happen. I never feel so boring in reading a book. This is my second book of deaver. I read the vanished man and I very enjoy but this book was inferior.  Maybe one thing in the book was enjoyable and this is the descriptions of Deaver- like the description of the childhood of  Hrubek and of Lis- this was touching and maybe this give me the fews moments of enjoy in the book 
 Elections take place at the precinct level in each county - the Bushies would have to have PAID OFF large numbers of precinct workers (Bi-partisan control exists in Ohio) to pull off voter fraud and then keep that SECRET - Not Likely.  If they actually did control elections, why would the Bushies allow the outcomes to come so close to losing - doesn't compute!  In 2000, all major media studies concluded Bush won that election.  In fact, in  Miami-Dade County, the "Palm Beach Post" study showed Bush would have actually GAINED six votes over Gore out of the 10,600 disputed votes.  Gore NEVER requested a total state recount in Florida so that argument is irrelevant. The U.S. Supreme Court had to intervene because election rules/procedures cannot be changed "after the fact."    In Ohio in 2004, as reported by Dan Balz, "Washington Post," 6/23/05, a five month study commissioned by the "Democratic National Committee," concluded "there was no evidence of fraud in the outcome."  Further, Cornell University Professor Walter Mebane, Jr., who participated in the study, stated there was "no support whatsoever for the claim that there was large scale mis-allocation of votes from Kerry to Bush in Ohio" and also stated "it is highly unlikely Kerry would have won the state in any case."  Dan Balz also reported that the African American vote turnout was at a record level in Ohio being 84,000 higher than 2000.  Balz also reported that a higher percentage of "provisional ballots" were counted in Ohio in 2004 at 78% versus Pennsylvania at 49% and Florida at 36%.  Also in 2004 in Ohio, a study by several major OHIO newspapers found no evidence of fraud.  I recently saw Mr. Miller on C-SPAN discussing this book and he looked like a "Woody Allen-esque" figure spinning his conspiracy theories.  I had to laugh at most of it - if there had been concrete evidence of actual fraud, the anti-Bush mainstream media would have been "all over it."  My prediction is that this book will end up on the same dust bin of history as Congressman John Conyer's fevered imaginations about the Ohio election 
 David Irving, for those who read his books and read the Trial Transcripts, makes it quite clear that   1. The Jews were killed by the Nazis  2. Hitler as Head of State is ultimately responsible.  3. How this happened is not as clear cut as made out to be and at any time things could have turned out differently and that everyone shares responsibility for these atrocities and no one came out of this war with clean hands.  This is why he is hated. 
 The tupperware was useless because the top was too small for the bottom. I am left to think that this seller is running a scam.I wish someone had told me before I threw 25 dollars down the drain 
 I bought this for my SciFi class.  We read Bram Stoker and the reward was supposed to be this film.  It was like giving kids liver for dinner then rewarding them with canned spinach.  Everyone was so disappointed.  I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The history of the film with the lawsuits is really interesting and the clips you've seen are wonderfully scary with brilliant make-up.  The problem is that there is a month's worth of boring between the good stuff.  Fast forward or the students who expect CGI will fall asleep if they stay in class that long.  Bela Lugosi is a much better bet.  For a silent, Metropolis is much more compelling even to those CG fans 
 Yes folks, "Mumbles the Wrist Snapper" has struck again. Seagal has perfected the art of playing CIA operatives with different names--he's quite the versatile actor. (Though let us not forget that Seagal claims to have been a CIA operative in real life.) Seagal has stated that as his early films were produced by the mob, he was often forced into making films he really did not want to make. This, he has stated, explains some of the low quality of his earlier films. Now, he asserts, he's free to make whatever type of film he wants. Apparently, now that the man seems to have lost his mind and thinks he's some type of reincarnated Eastern religious figure (which he really does, I kid you not), the types of films he wants to make are incoherent messes with little-to-no fighting, unintentionally bad dialogue, some of the worst editing ever scene in film ("The Foreigner," for instance, was one of the worst films I've seen in my life), and filled with liberal doses of cheap, shallow, dime-store philosophy quotes that make fortune cookie sayings sound like propositions from Wittgenstein's Tractatus. Despite all this, his films still have surprisingly high budgets and he still receives salaries in the millions. He states that he keeps making films for his fans, and surprisingly, he still does have an ardent following. I say this because whilst he claims to be "doing it for the fans," when watching his films of late one is left with the feeling that he really doesn't give a crap anymore. He virtually sleepwalks through his roles now; he's out of shape; in some of his films he uses stunt doubles that weigh half what he does; he can't even bother speaking his own lines in half his newer films, and unfortunately, many of his fight scenes now are constructed solely after-the-fact in the editing room. Anyone who doubts this should watch the marketplace fight in "Belly of the Beast," in which, while he is using only one arm fighting a man with a knife, the weapon in the man's left hand keeps disappearing and reappearing--obviously the sign of trick editing.   Why, why, oh why does Seagal let someone who sounds like a knock-off Benicio Del Toro dub his lines? Someone explain this to me please!   Of his earlier films, one could complain that many of Seagal's moves only work if the opponent charges you head on--lucky for Seagal he fights uncoordinated fools that only know how to attack by blindly charging while yelling out loud. Of his new films, one could complain that Seagal really just stands there and kills people with that Buddhist magic called "film editing"--some sped up hands (a.k.a. "death by paddycake"), cut to a skinny stunt double, cut to someone being pulled away by a wire, cut to a dead bad guy. (It would be nice to see Seagal make a movie in which he makes fun of himself, comes off his ridiculous pedestal, maybe plays somebody's has-been uncle who once owned a dojo, and then has to get back into shape to prove himself again. That would be good.)   My readers may be wondering why I am not reviewing "Into the Sun." Well, I was merely setting up the review, so to speak. "Into the Sun" is a step above Seagal's other recent films. In fact, it is Seagal's best film--by far. It seems to have even perhaps been a labor of love for the star. He wrote it, produced it, stars in it, performed many of the songs in the background (and his music, by the way, is excellent), does not rely on a stunt double in the action scenes, and even bothered to dub all his own lines.   The pacing of this film, sans the nonsensical intro, is brooding and seemed intentionally slow. This was to me, however, quite effective in building up to the excellent climax. Those complaining that the film seems, at first, rather bereft of action will be quite pleased by the last 30 minutes or so of the film. Seagal and his small entourage take it upon themselves to wipe out the local young leaders of an emerging alliance between the Yakuza and the Tongs. The action in these scenes is extremely well-paced, well-mounted, and is set to an excellent soundtrack (Japanese drums). The sword fights at the end of this film are very, very nicely done. It should be mentioned that "Kill Bill" seems to have perhaps served as some of the inspiration for this film, though the duels in "Into the Sun" are much, much more realistic and authentic than anything in "Kill Bill," which relied WAY too heavily on the increasingly annoying fad of "wirefu." So, while "Kill Bill" may have in part inspired Seagal to pick up the old samurai sword, it should be mentioned that the fights in this film are more akin to classic chambara films than to Tarantino's opus. In fact, the duels at the end of "Into the Sun," as brief, brutal, and realistic as they are, are wonderful; the climax to this film is downright beautiful. There are also a couple hand-to-hand fights in the film, which are both better-handled than any of Seagal's other fight scenes in recent years.   I do not know why Seagal has such a bad rap. He's a good martial artist, in fact the best one currently making martial arts films--and his fight seens (Excepting "Belly of the Beast," "Exit Wounds," and the idiotic "Half Past Dead," regularly look more realistic and more authentic than dozens of fight scenes of other, more popular martial arts stars (including Jet Li). The main trouble here is, save for the nice climax, there is really nothing else going on in this film, except watching Seagal drive around Tokyo and talk on a cell phone. For a straight to video flick this movie had a pretty big budget--my main complaint is that the whole movie could have easily, easily been much better. For starters, that whole nonsensical, corny intro that looks as though it was filmed for another movie altogether should have been cut from the film. It would have made much more sense to have simply begun the movie with the assassination, which I suspect, from the shoddy appearance of the bizarre intro "jungle scene," was the original plan in the first place. To conclude, if you're a Seagal fan, this film is easily his best. Pick it up.   
 This book is a case and point regarding the problems of selling a book idea before a word of it has been written (or before the event that is supposed to inspire the book has even happened).  Rich Smith recounts in this book the process of scoring the book deal itself, and the instant interest and publicity he got for the concept, regardless of the fact that he had nothing at that point than to suggest that he go to America and break ridiculous laws.  Perhaps this was to show some of the general dislike of America abroad, or the general consensus that America needs to be brought down a notch or two, which becomes apparent when many other countries relish in the absurdities of America.  But because the trip itself can probably be termed, in the truest sense of the word, "a bust," and Rich and his traveling mate spend more time trying to find ways to actually violate these laws (albeit, in often secretive and cowardly manners, with little attempt to make any public announcement of their ectivities to see if any authorities would actually stand behind their antiquated or absurd regulations) rather than spend much of any time in actual transgression, and so a lot of the book feels like a lot of padding.  If this concept and execution were so sound to write a full book about, what would be the need of spending 50 pages or so of the beginning to detail how the idea came about or the book deal itself nailed?  The answer is simple: it is BECAUSE the trip itself turns out to be diappointing and with little insight that the book has to be padded with a lot of this tangential information.  Rather than start the book with a concise mention of Balderdash and the book's inspiring moment, the author takes us through an elongated recounting of the final round of the game in question--in short, the book's effort feels like the work of a high school sophomore trying to make a 500 word essay fill up the required 1500 by the teacher, an effort that usually ends up with a lot of meaningless description and a lot of getting to the obvious.  Rather than just skulk about and hope someone noticed their law-breaking, the author could have served his purpose much more directly by making his actions far more public, as I had mentioned before, and see if his chosen townships or state authorities would have stood behind their statutes.  Instead, the author, when actually able to find a way to break the law, does so like a member of Jackass--waiting for someone to notice.  In the end, this book comes across as a similarly puerile attempt at a little attention. 
 Jack kornfield just doesn't know how to compose a sentence with any flair. He also makes unwarrented assumptions about how the world works and never defends them rationaly. The man doesn't have a critical bone in his body. This is just another example of nonsense that get published in the buddhist community and eaten up by unthoughtful readers. TERRIBL 
 This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  "Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed. 
 As an atheist with a strong belief in ethical behavior and doing good for others, I have always had a certain ambivalence towards Mother Teresa. I was expecting Hitchens to reveal all sorts of previously unknown facts about how Mother Teresa was actually a phony, mistreating others and scamming funds for her own financial benefit. But actually the portrait that emerges is of a very sincere and dedicated woman, though politically and socially naive in her actions. In fact, almost all of Hitchens' criticisms of Mother Teresa could be equally directed towards the Vatican itself. Yes, I disagree with her staunch opposition to birth control and abortion, also, that in her zealous affirmation of Church doctrine, she is often doing more harm than good to the very people she is trying to help. But does this make her an evil menace, as Hitchens seems to suggest? No, not really, just a misguided person who is still very sincere and dedicated to helping the poor according to her own religious convictions.   I don't feel like I learned much from this book that I didn't already know. Also I was somewhat put off by Hitchens' consistently arrogrant and snide tone. He really seems to be going for the jugular against Mother Teresa. If he had more damning facts in his case against her I might be more open to his harsh commentary. Instead he is basically providing a critique that could be equally leveled against the Vatican and conservative Catholic dogma in general. To me this information was already well known and not really worthy of a personal attack against Mother Teresa herself. To someone with no knowledge of Church doctrine or its questionable political affiliations this might be an informative read. But, for me, it was a dull disappointiment 
 This is a very uninforming movie.  I'm usually a fan of a good propaganda movie but this is just bad.  There is no relevent information here they simply tell you ideas that you most likely allready had in your head without confirming them with hard evidence.  If you want to watch an actually worth while journalistic film about the bush ties then get Martial Law 911 : rise of the police state.  NOw that is one brilliant peice of wor 
 I'm not saying this is an utterly anti-religious book, but Davis does, at times, needlessly offer ill conceived off-color comments, jibes, or poorly humored jokes that mar what could have otherwise  been an accessible, moderated, insightful, and meaningful exploration of the book we have come to know as The Bible.  This does not serve the reader well, and sadly trivializes many of the issues Davis attempts to address in his book; reducing them to clever catch phrases, bad one liners, self-serving pop culture references, or back-handed digs at the faith of many believers.   Having read previous works by Mr. Davis, I was expecting a bit more "scholarly" meat on the bone than he actually delivers with this one.  That was my mistake.  What we get instead is the literary equivalent of cotton candy: sweet and easy to swallow, but not very nutritious (either intellectually or spiritually).   Also, I found more of a negative philosophical bias and less of an intellectual balance in this book than others of his I have read.  This does not serve the author well.  
 I enjoy the genre of over the top gore comedy but this one didn't interest me.  The story was very slow paced and uninteresting with some pretty unimaginative gore.    It was also ridiculous and not in a comedic way but a 'that is stupid' way.  People are smashing through stone walls a lot.   The final 'ultra' gory finale really didn't interest me either.  Watch Troma's Terror Firmer or Citizen Toxie if you enjoy this type of movie.  Or wait for Poultrygeist which will probably be pretty Tromariffic.  I don't know when this was made but I would guess it has to be inspired by Troma.   I appreciate the effort but it didn't match let alone surpass Troma for gore comedy 
 Not since St. Augustine has there been such a whining, carping screed begging for Christian inculcation by a celebrated intellect. I'm not even sure why this is a book. A cranky letter to the dean, and president of the alumni association would have served his purpose, and saved a few trees as well.   Without going into detail, or needing to, you will find in a nutshell that Mr. Buckley feels it's fine for Yale faculty of faith to gently shepherd students toward Christian beliefs within their science and math classes, but it's a sin for the other, heathen, atheistic masters, to rampage through the clay of young minds and, in one semester, destroy the fragile faith of 18 to 20 years of Christian indoctrination. Pu-leese!  I'll grant you he was only 25, and at that time standing up for one's individual ideals was new, but why is it still in print!  On the other hand, in today's renewed climate of monkey-brained hysteria in the classroom perhaps it might seem to be time to dig up an old reactionary guru or two for validation. In fact, soon I wouldn't be surprised to hear that some addlebrained congressman was trying to pass a law mandating the teaching of Buckleism in schools.  Cool book title though!  
 Mellow, sappy and annoying. Why would anyone want to buy this? 
 I can't really bring myself to either like or dislike this movie entirely.  Another entry in the "future troopers" genre, it uses science fiction to explore the notion of a fierce, unstoppable, but ultimately disposable form of combat soldier.  Examples of this notion have ranged from the excellent (Blade Runner, Robocop and the Terminator) to the awful (Universal Soldiers).  This one's okay.  On first viewing, it reminds me of a larger-budget version of Enemy Mine, in which we get barely a glimpse of a war-torn future before the hero is dumped on a barely habitable planet, struggles for survival, and ends up in your basic action climax.  Like Dennis Quaid and Louis Gossett, Jr. in that movie, Kurt Russell gives a performance better than his material deserves -- which isn't saying much, since a lot of Soldier plays like it was written for Stallone at the height of his Rambo misanthropy.  The cast is generally good, particularly Russell's finely understated performance -- his character's lifelong conditioning has made him incapable of expressing emotion, or even speaking conversationally (he robotically addresses everyone but the enemy as "sir"), yet he conveys enough in his body language to make more of his role than one might expect.    Another reviewer called this a sequel to Blade Runner and compared Russell's Sgt. Todd to BR's Deckard.  Without arguing too much, I'd modify that by saying it's more of a Blade Runner prequel (thematically, if not literally).  It's essentially the backstory of Blade Runner's Roy Batty, an enhanced combat soldier bred for offworld service but never regarded as truly human, who rebels against his shortsighted human masters and leads his followers to a prospective home on another world.  Of course, Todd's stoic efficiency bears little resemblance to Batty's charismatic dark angel persona, but they're flipsides of the same coin.  (The fact that both films were written by the same screenwriter becomes clear long before the credits roll -- listen for the "Tanhauser Gate" reference.)  Soldier isn't a great movie by any stretch.  If anything, it has the feel of a script written back in the 80's that had gathered dust on a shelf until someone felt like filming it.  Take it on that level, and it's watchable.  Not great, but good enough to pass a little time 
 This book is dangerous and filled very bad, dangerous advice. It was written in 1998, so giving the benefit of the doubt, perhaps our thinking about homing a rescue dog has evolved, but this book is extremely outdated.  It recommends using the dog's crate as a place for punishment -which we all know is wrong. It further recommends "pops" with the leash to jerk your dog into obedience and "staring down" a dog into submission -again, outdated, inappropriate concepts. It is a very high level, superficial, quick read riddled with inappropriate advice that certainly does not speak to how one goes about brining a new, most likely scared, rescue dog into your home. 
 I will not watch the movie "Andersonville" until they make a movie called "Elmira"(the camp in Elmira, N.Y., the worst of the Union prison camps had 35% death rate) 
 Keynes was no doubt an influential economist.  His theories and 'expertise' on economics influenced the post-New Deal economic policies of the United States and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like IMF.  However, his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of Keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the U.S. particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation (an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to Keynesism.)  We have Keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government.  Read Planning for Freedom or Socialism by Ludwig von Mises instead 
 Published by the Disney Corporation, not exactly an objective source for a biography of Walt Disney. You'll learn more about the man just wandering his parks and watching his films than you will from this extended press release, which completely ignores key individuals and events that helped shape Uncle Walt. The photos aren't very interesting either -- pass on this one. 
 It's great that little girls who are being potty trained are learning that they have a 'pee pee' and all, but what the heck is a 'pee pee' anyway? I always thought that 'pee pee' comes out of a 'wee wee' and not the other way around.    I was originally intrigued that there were both 'boy' and 'girl' books...is their anatomy so different that they need different books? Apparently not, as the 'once upon a potty-girl' book also says that girls have 'pee pee's'...So I guess the only difference is the color of the flowers...not sure why you need separate books. It's nice though that they have a spanish version of this volume too so our espanol speaking friends can teach their children the value of gender differences too...blue for boys, pink and purple for girls. Maybe the chamber pot style toilets in the book actually exist in a spanish speaking country somewhere...maybe... 
 Don't let the stars fool you, I love this movie and if I were reviewing the movie itself on its merits alone, it would get 6 stars.  My love for this classic is the reason I can give this DVD version only two stars.  The print is very poor - the lighting in some scenes is too dark to pick up some details.  There are skips and jumps in the frame.  The sound transfer is also very uneven.  In fact my 20 year-old VHS tape is STILL better quality than this DVD.  But all those technical faults could be forgiven were it not for the most egregious cut of all - a few lines of dialogue.  In a pivotal scene where the grocer delivers to the Davis house, Charley has just told Peg that he needs his money to bet on the fight.  The grocer comes in and talks about everyone betting on the fight - Charley says anyone who bets is foolish.  The grocer disagrees.  The words that were cut out of this print, essentially the heart of why the neighborhood loves their champ, are very simple "In Europe, the Nazis are killing our people, but here Charley is Champeen!  No, it's not about the money."  I have no idea why these lines are missing, but it was the final straw before I returned the DVD for a refund.    Unfortunately us movie fans lose out again.  We can't get a decent transfer or an unedited copy of a great film.  Many lesser films released in the last 5 years have several editions available, with added footage, interviews, alternate endings, "director's" cuts and other gimmicks to drive sales.  It's a good thing I haven't given away my VHS tape or dumped my VCR, otherwise I'd never again see this movie in a facsimile of its intended presentation.  I guess the simple grocer was wrong, it's always about the money 
 Having lived in eastern europe all my life where textbooks are more or less just like Landau's I have to say that I by far prefer the American ones, many times more expensive though they may be. This book is outdated, as it only treats integrable systems, and utterly unsuitable for learning mechanics from, though it makes an excellent review of the theory if you have already learned it from another book.   If there was nothing else to remark I would have given it three stars based on this, but the book looks like it's photocopied from the original typewritter transcript. The book (mine being a 2005 reprint) has terrible printing quality. The paper and binding look like they are the cheapest the publisher could get. If this were an estern european textbook it would be sold for $5. To top it off, my copy came with a very strange folding defect.  These defects were shared by all three of Landau's books I ordered. Needless to say, I shan't be getting the rest of them. Instead I recommend getting a newer text such as the excellent _Structure and Intepretation of Classical Mechanics_ or somesuch, and I recommend that Americans stop seeing gold in everything that's foreign 
 This must be one of the latest entries in the Dan Brown school of writing. Name an expert, assign an audience, lecture on historical points and expect applause at the end. Well, Kathy Reichs can wait for a long time. There will be no applause for this book. I would like my money back. I'm almost finished and still can't really figure out what the plot actually is. I guess she will just pop the final lecture and the conclusion will name the murderer. What about motive, character development (sex + history), etc... This is my first novel by this author and it will be my last 
 The description claims that these scissors are good for use in the kitchen but I think that needs some clarification.  The cutting edge of the blades is only about an inch and a half long!  The "Torque engineering" that is referred to can surely only mean that the handles are longer than the blades and so providing a gain due to leverage - other than that there is nothing really different compared to 'regular' scissors.  When the description refers to chicken bones does it really mean just chicken ribs and cartlidge? The pivot is a simple rivet - pretty basic (and cheap) for a relatively expensive pair of scissors.  Such a simple rivet also means that you can't take the blades apart.  The scissors do work OK as regular scissors i.e. for cutting paper, plastic packaging etc. but no more so than any other reasonably well made, and possibly less expensive, design 
 While I did enjoy parts of the book, I find it to be lacking overall.  Gertie is a believable character but lacks in courage.  She was supposedly a strong person.  She did face many challanges but didn't overcome then.  Instead she sidestepped her problems.  Not until the last page does she actually become the character she is portrayed to be but I barely made it to the last page.  The climax occurs far too early in the book so the resolution takes up far too much time.  The one star was given on pity alone.  Do not read this book if you have seen the movie.  In fact do not read this book period 
 Prof. Chudacoff and Smith's book is concise in its discussion of events and personalities.  In this sense it is an ideal _textbook_--but even though it is in its fifth edition it could use some editing!  There are  problems with textual flow and art, and in useful conclusions: saloons  provided an outlet for "the musical expression of the black  soul."  Or how about the oft-mentioned but never defined or measured  "rugged individualism" of Americans 
 The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again. 
 The book is full of nonsense that should be simple common sense to anyone that has worked in the business world.  Mostly this book is a chance for the author to talk of his many "high level" meetings and for him to boast about all of the execs and sports figures that he knows.  This book is rather entertaining, but you will not gain much from it in the way of business or management knowledge 
 I found the product to be made very poorly....all it too is one drop on the floor and the camera battery door cracked and that was is for the camera too....NOT A KID friendly camera at all 
 Love Michael Buble, but this was more like a home made movie of someone using their camcorder from the audience.  Parts of Michael's head was cut off, and then; sometimes, his whole head was cut off.  Most of the time, the camera man didn't expect where Michael was going to move to and you'll get a jerky movement of the camera man trying to get Michael back into the picture.  I wish they would have said in the description that this was more of a documentary than a concert.  That this was just home made videos.  This was definitely not worth $20.  If you want a professional quality concert, I would recommend buying Michael Buble's Caught in the Act.  Caught in the Act was worth the $20 bucks.  You get professional camera men who anticipated Michael's movements, and parts of his head was never cut off like Come Fly with Me's DVD.  Also, the sound quality on Caught in the Act was way better.  Now, I understand why some places sold Come Fly with Me DVD's and had the word enhanced after it.  The DVD that I received was not enhanced.  Anyways, skip this one, and get "Caught in the Act" instead 
 I could sum up this book very quickly:  1) Trust in God for everything  2) Read the Bible  3) Attend church  4) Ask your husband, church, other Christians for help  The book is full of fluffy ideas like: "We need to know ourselves the way God knows us" "Find a Christian counselor" and advice for single mothers to simply attend church if seeking help.  The book primarily revolves around the Bible and its interpretation of parenting. Why not cut out the middle-man and just read this "wonderful book?" It's not like the Bible is a work in progress.   This book is more about proselytizing and keeping Evangelicals reading "inspired" books rather than competing viewpoints. And with America being one of the most pure Christian nations in the world ( US is more Christian than India is Hindu and Israel is Jewish ). Anything published by Zondervan should be looked at skeptically.   I also dislike how males are stilled deemed unworthy parents in the Christian community. They can assist and help , but cannot be considered primary parents. But given this books lack of true substance, I doubt it would have made any difference 
 Readers with previous experience with Ornstein's books may find The Right Mind the most interesting he's written. The view of brain through psychology offers a different approach about brain functions. For Beginners, this book may be quite useful. Though I read other book from  Ornestein, I was expecting to find deep research on brain assymetry, which  this book is poor, there's nothing you can't find over Internet on related  sites. For intermeddiate readers on brain issue, this book may offer some  interesting approaches, but too hard to get them between 200 pages.  Instead, I would reccomend Carl Sagan's "Dragons of Eden", a  marvelous and interesting book about brain development. Advanced readers  won't like Ornstein for explaing brain lateralization, and a more  appropriate book would be "Left brain, Right Brain", the only  serious book written on this subject. Conclusion: Ornstein book is not that  bad at all. If you like Oliver Sacks and psychological views of brain, this  is indeed a good choice. Wrong Title though, coz it doesn't have much about  brain lateralization itself (by the way, the book enphasizes the importance  of both hemispheres working together - which is quite obvious when you want  a scientific approach - but many people forget on daily life) 
 I continue to marvel at "men" like James Dobson who blatantly ignores all the solid statistical evidence that children brought up with love and without violence function better in life.  Dobson is also an anti-porn crusader, and he also ignores the fact that anywhere porn has been legalized, rape statistics have dropped dramatically. (Source: the book 'Porn 101' 
 This is the same old tired suggestions for cleaning up your clutter.  The suggestions given are to install custom made draws that double and triple pull out.  The suggestion for the pantry was to organize cans from little to big (duh) and then group like items together (duh) that's in every single organizing book published so this one is not different than any other.  Also the other suggestion was to install a pull out swinging triple door pantry system.  Oh is that affordable? If I had $75,000 to redo my kitchen I would install the fancy garbage bin that pulls out of the cabinet and the double drawer pot rack with side lid bins.  Come on, don't waste your money on this book or it's suggestions.  Very few pictures and all for the rich.  I thought Good Housekeeping was for the everyday family.  Get it at the library and then return it after you don't read it.  
 This book is really boring.  It's language is confusing, its references to other obscure pieces of literature are too complex, and it just really stinks 
 Written a little bit too ironically. I did enjoy the reference to Encyclopedia Brown. Fun for a quick read and perhaps for those who are more enmeshed in the ND world than I 
 There's a reason that there are over 200,000 albums ranked before this  one.  Even if I was a big fan of rap, I would be a fan of bad rap.  If you  enjoy droning, monotone vocals with no real music to back it up then maybe  this is for you, but even then I wouldn't recommend it.  Maybe try Grits or  something (try anything else... please!!) 
 I ordinarily really enjoy Coulter's books (as far-fetched as they may seem).  But I had a terrible time getting into this one because it's written in first-person from the male perspective.  That and the story just didn't interest me.  I read the whole thing anyway (how can you not?), but this is not one that I will read again 
 The bulk of these songs have been done to death on numerous previous compilations 
 I had never read anything by Terry Brooks, so I thought I would try listening to Armageddon's Children because I thought the premise sounded interesting. I guess the story is interesting, but I found it extremely slow and boring. The narrator has a dreary boring voice that drove me crazy. I couldn't even finish listening to the whole thing because it became torture 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 i ordered the item saying it was in-stock. but days passed i still havent received the item until i followed it up. i was told the item was in a back order. i think they shouldnt write in-stock if the item is really a back order meaning they dont have it. it delayed the item for 2-3weeks and it was suppose to be a gift. though i can say the item was nice when i got it 
 You'll need Viagra to get up to speed for the exam after reading this one. I am an MCSE, CCNA and a technical writer for several leading tech rags, and I have to say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. The author spends more time trying to "make it interesting" than giving you useful info that you can actually use. Example: During the discussion on Site Links the author fails to inform you that if you plan to use SMTP to perform directory replication that DCs need to be in different domains and in different sites. This minor oversight could have a huge impact both on the exam and in the real world. Another example is the complete lack of a discussion on how the tombstone setting of directory objects affects the effective shelf life of your backups. Hello???? It's like Sybex just followed the bare minimum in order to call this thing a study guide. The software is ok, but the free practice exams were weak as expected. I like books that I can keep as reference material after I read them. The only thing you will use this one for is lining your garbage can. Don't waste your time with this dribble. Get a real book 
 I found this book through Taunton Press who reputably published books and magazines on the finer skills of sewing.  I am very glad that I borrowed Sew Subversive from my local library before purchasing it!  As the other reviews state, the main topics cover re-vamping your thrift store find.  On the brighter side, the first third of the book covers the basic sewing skills such as tension for a sewing machine and a couple of hand stithes.  Overall, I would recomend this book as a gift for an adolescent teen who would like to learn a bit about sewing 
 This book would have been more suitable as a graduate level business course text book rather than as a "suspence" novel.  It was boring.  Although Ludlum is a favorite author, this boring attempt at  suspence took him down in my estimation 
 CT is quick to call the collection agency.  They require written "opt-out" notification from the subscriber that the subscription is to be terminated.  Beware, these guys are a credit risk.  Too much trouble for what is otherwise a good magazine 
 Mr. Simmons's story is a cautionary tale of lies and deception.  He is delusional about the lack of recovery and involves those who love him in his "quicksand of lies and cruelty."   He claims to have loved those who care for him and yet he hurts them and worst, expose them to the risk HIV/AIDS with his reckless behavior.  I had hoped to read further his story redemption and atonement for those he had hurt that he claimed to love.   There is no such ending 
 This is a miserable book.  A few minutes in, it has a description of meat running with blood, then shortly later a detailed description of a botched, brutal slaughter of a baby lamb.  That's when I tossed the book into the rubbish pile.  I'd give it negative stars if that were possible, it certainly doesn't deserve even one star 
  For the best review of this one, check the NY Times.     "You meet Sharon Stone and John Kerry and a woman who once weighed 488 pounds and an obese couple carrying rifles, but there's nobody here whom you recognize. In more than 300 pages, nobody tells a joke. Nobody does much work. Nobody sits and eats and enjoys their food. You've lived all your life in America, never attended a megachurch or a brothel, don't own guns, are non-Amish, and it dawns on you that this is a book about the French. There's no reason for it to exist in English, except as evidence that travel need not be broadening and one should be wary of books with Tocqueville in the title."  ".... every 10 pages or so, Lévy walks into a wall. About Old Glory, for example. Someone has told him about the rules for proper handling of the flag, and from these (the flag must not be allowed to touch the ground, must be disposed of by burning) he has invented an American flag fetish, a national obsession, a cult of flag worship." MYTimes  As far I can tell, Lévy is a "self-styled" philosopher and a boring writer, except to the French who treat him like a film star.  It makes you wonder about the French.  I have known some who are fine people; but this man makes me recall the English indictment:  "France; a lovely country. Too bad about the people."  Too bad their taste in writers isn't as good as their taste in food and fashion 
 I'm a senior at Oglethorpe University, minoring in English, and I have to say I was disappointed in having this text as my last assignment in our class "The Child in Literature" and as my last English assignment ever.  I found the characters flat and the symbolism overt and unengaging.  At first I thought that the children acted the way I expected them to because they are children.  Children are easily manipulated by their environment.  But as the book progressed, the reader could see each character take the expected turns, and land in the expected outcomes.  Cody needed a father, throughout the entire novel, so obviously he will emulate his father in his adult life.  Jenny is a brilliant girl searching for real companionship, so her end is just as predictable.  And Ezra.  From the monopoly scene in the beginning to defeat in his love life, I never once thought he would veer from that path, and end up any differently than he did.  A book that does not challenge it's readers, and does not invoke any hope in a different outcome, is a very flat and disappointing book.  Even the food symbols, or the name associations, or the exact mirrored images of some of the characters (Luke and his game, or Luke and his recorder, anyone?) are blatently handed out and explained.  I like what Tyler was trying to do, and I can take the characters for what they are, and maybe enjoy them, but as someone who loves to remove the author's intention and just delve into a text, this book upsets me.  Tyler leaves literally no room for interpretation at all.  That might make her a "good" writer, but it certainly doesn't make it a good book.  A book you can't discuss or argue over the meaning of seems pointless.  I can see myself in every one of those characters, but I didn't learn anything from it.  This, to me, seems like light beach reading.  Though the subject is so dark, I don't think I could even recommend it for that. 
 Too small to be of much use, this tea kettle is also too hot to handle.  Using a pot holder on a tea kettle is clumsy and should not be necessary.  Keep searching, there has to be something better out there 
 This product is attractive and works efficiently; however, my unit produced toxic smelling water the first 5 times I tested it out.  I will try a metal electric kettle next 
 A reader writes: "However, Mr. Sulloway's book is tightly reasoned and supported by a great deal of research."  You might want to look at the discussion of Sulloway's work in Judith Harris' recent _No Two Alike_, pp 92-112. According to that account, Sulloway's work was never published in a peer reviewed journal, the book in which it was published failed to provide the sort of information needed for other people to check the truth of his results, and Sulloway repeatedly refused requests for such data--for instance, the names of the Protestant and Catholic martyrs whose birth order rankings he offers as evidence, or cites to the studies whose results he claims to summarize.   When someone wrote a critical article pointing out evidence that his factual assertions about the data were false, he delayed the publication for several years by the threat of lawsuits.  Judging by her previous book, Harris is a careful writer, so absent some evidence to the contrary my current conclusion is that Sulloway is a fraud 
 I remember reading this book when I was a teen, at a time when the church I was attending was very much into end-time prophecies. Embarrassing as it is to admit it, I fell for it hook, line, and sinker. (*blush*) Yet, 1988 came and went, nothing horrible happened, and I forgot about this steaming pile of dog manure. It didn't matter, though, because there were, and still are, plenty of other "prophetic" books to fill the gap and keep Christians pants-wetting scared. I am no longer a Christian, and in retrospect, I wonder why we were all so scared by Hal Lindsey's nonsense. After all, the end times meant that Sweet Jesus was coming and we'd all be raptured away into the clouds to avoid all the tribulation and terror! I think there was the secret fear that we wouldn't be good enough and our allegedly loving savior would leave us behind on a whim.   At any rate, I wouldn't recommend Hal's book for any purpose other than fireplace kindling, or maybe as a good laugh at the gullibility of desperate and easily frightened people. He is no different than any other self-proclaimed prophet of God, picking whatever scriptures he can to back up his crazy ideas and attempting to use math to count the number of days, weeks, and generations since this or that event. If you must buy it, look for it at thrift stores, where you can pick it up for 50 cents; save your ten bucks for something more worthwhile, like a couple of Spider-Man comics or something 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 ...I did not like it all!...the book is so predictable! By the 3rd to last chapter, I already knew what was going to happen. I do not reccommend this book unless you like books about history 
 I purchased the Adaptation soundtrack thinking the song from the trailer and the V.W. commercial would be on it. The soundtrack is nothing more than very horrible sounds, nothing from the trailer and very expensive. False advertising at it's best 
 While Berlant is quite definatly a good cultural theorist, the type of work she does is problematic. This book regularly tries to define a national mindset in relation to the productions of a small number of people. While one might be able to analyze any number of the texts mentioned in this book, Berlant insists on saying that these texts relate to a particular way of thinking that are shared by at least a majority of our population (enough to elect republicans to the presidency). She repeatedly uses really loaded/offensive terms, which can be fun if you politically agree with her (for instance patriotism=infantile citizenship, heterosexuality=dead sexuality), but if you disagree even slightly with her they seem mostly like bullying. While I'm rather left leaning, the core of her arguement, that right leaning people vote more based on emotions rather than well thought out ideas, I find to be mostly baseless (I think a misunderstanding of economics and international politics are the reason people vote republican... or immense wealth). Since most of the textual examples she uses I don't think can ever adequatly stand for the majority of the people she claims they represent, and are more caricatures of poltical discourse (which of course most political discourse is) rather than actual personal poltics, her work comes across as being based on a confusion of aggressiveness and refrences to Lacan with strong theorizing.  Unless you want to get into arguements with friends who really like this book, I'd pass it up if I were you 
 I found the DVD to be completey inappropriate for children.  Too much violance and too much swearing.  My kids watched 5 minutes of it and its now in the garbage 
 I read the original BFL and found it to be fantastic, so when I saw a BFL for women I was thrilled, without a second thought I bought it.  It has good concepts like dividing women's life into phases, but that's it.  Even though the author tried to appeal to women, I found the original BFL much more motivating.  Maybe this book is OK for women who have not read other books or who have not followed a single program, but for me it was dissappointing, I felt much more involved with a male author than by a woman!!! Program lacks stucture, I can't  imagine what a man would think about this book!! 
 I journeyed to the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore to see the exhibition. "MANET - The Still Life Paintings" which is on view until April 22, 2001. The show was previously at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.  It is a lovely, intimate show.  The majority of these gorgeous still lifes of fruits, vegetables and flowers were painted in the last three years of Manet's life. Unfortunately, the catalogue does not begin to do these beautful oil paintings and watercolors justice.  The book's colorplates are of unsatisfactory quality and fail to capture the sumptuousness of these touching works of art.  The book measures just shy of 9 inches by 9 inches, too small to get any partial enjoyment after seeing the exhibition. The text does not advance art scholarship. Not worth the price 
 To be fair there are a few good ideas but by and large - this is not a good book.   In addition - this book's attitude that 2nd time brides really should focus on tiny small weddings that no one will notice.  Bridal Bargains is much better and gives practical information. 
   I just read this book, quite quickly in one afternoon. I think I've pretty much purchased and read every Danielle Steel book she's ever written as they used to be entertaining quick reads. I understand she has become an empire but must she also be a book writing factory. There is never much suprise as to how a DS book will end, the pleasure in reading them comes from the twist and turns,  historical and geographical research she puts into her books. This book reads more like a short story as many of her other recent books. Definately not worth the hardcover price.  Time to slow down and put out some quality work instead of quantity.  This book was fluffy & dull 
 I bought this book in order to prepare myself to take the JLPT4 exam. And, well, I was in for a shock. The title is nothing if not misleading. The grammar covered DOES NOT focus on what you would expect to be basic material. Of the hundred odd "connections" that the author has chosen, only a handful are JLPT4, and the other half are split between JLPT3 and JLPT2. Other cons are that the language of the author is of a very wordy and academic nature, so the explanations seem more complex than clear or concise! And, contrary to the premise that much of this book is aimed at beginners, in the majority of cases the author clearly expects readers to already have a grasp of intermediate grammar, thus leaving far too many things improperly explained, skimmed over, or even lacking in any explanation at all.   However, this is not to say that this book is a waste of good paper. If you are of an intermediate-higher level (read: higher JLPT3 and above) it can come in quite useful, because it at least alerted me to a lot of aspects many other grammar books did not even touch on, even though it failed to explain many of these in detail. And if you're a beginner, consider it for future reference, but don't be in any hurry to buy it.  
 I read this book, actually started thumbing thru the text it was so raunchy.  I thought women only gossiped.  This weirdo tries to ruin other peoples careers by dishing their dirt like an Enquirer.  What a disturbed blob.  Let see, how can I ruin this person's entire life's work with a few paragraphs of my blabbering opinions trying to make myself feel not so disgusting and worthless?   That is what it is all about, making yourself feel better at other peoples expense and trying to make a few bucks in the process.  
     Firstly, i want to make clear that i have a degree in geography and am very familiar with the topics 'discussed' in this book.  Paul Driessen is obviously well-educated and knows how to write, therefore it must be assumed that he has purposefully neglected the facts in order to contrive an argument that will appeal only to people with no prior knowledge of the topic...      For example,      He advocates the continued use of fossil fuels by declaring that there is no proof carbon emmisions are responsible for climate change.  Regardless of climate change, the excessive air pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels is indeed responsible for chronic respirotory illnesses worldwide (inc in the third world), and also catastrophic 'acid rain'...      This one example is indicative of basically every chapter in this book (this is why it was published by a small company and wasn't found in my university library).  Without prior knowledge of the subject, one could easily be led astray.      As a geographer i found this book interesting.  However, its profound inadequacies serve only to strengthen the integrity of the environmental movement.      I do fear though, that too many people have believed the rhetoric they have digested in this very short book with a catchy cover and title 
 Watch out for the volume leveling mentioned in another review. Surely the compliers could have come up with a better sort order than by composer. The change in tempo/volume between pieces makes it impossible to enjoy. My two CD's ended up in the trash.  Ke 
 Yes, yes, I know. Provine studied thousands of people but, what he failed to grasp is that laughter is the result of a "stuttering" brain. A person is confronted with anxiety and, the brain "stutters" and releases the vocalizations we call laughter. This brings the brain (rather mind) back into equilibrium and "solves" the dilemma . . .the anxiety 
 I couldn't stomach this movie for long. I kept waiting, hoping for some redeeming quality to emerge but the language, nudity, and explicit sexual content was too much for me so I turned it off and never saw the entire film. If there was any poignant, brilliant story with any depth, it was buried in filth and raunch. I would not recommend film this to anyone. Nicholas Cage or not, it was disgusting.  
 Sugrue's thesis in this book is that endemic racism (along with economic decline) is responsible for Detroit being largely Black, poor and greatly in decline.  He's a revisionist historian who wants to refute older narratives that Detroit is corrupt (because all the city governments after 1967 have been run by Democrats and Blacks).  Instead he attempts to refute that by showing the deeply ingrained racism in the community.  Sugrue's attempt at political polemics is bad history.  He fails to mention the obvious: Detroit is over-taxed and run by incompetent, corrupt politicians.  It's public unions have caused government workers to be some of the highest paid in the country with little to show for it.  This is thanks to former-Mayor Young who instituted an arbitration law.  To pay for this, the city's taxes are exorbitant which pushes businesses further out.  Because of this, Detroit never found other businesses to take the place of the declining auto-industry which has inflated pay for its jobs in the first place.  Of the past three mayors, two have been highly corrupt.  Archer who was mayor in the '90s, after a distinguished career in the state Supreme Court, tried to reform the city but was kicked out of office.  Young and the current mayor, Kilpatrick, are very corrupt.  Just do a google news search of "Kwame Kilpatrick" and "corrupt" and you'll see the various scandals that have plagued him.  Other than stealing city funds for himself and his family he turned down a $200,000,000 private gift to the city for charter schools because the teacher's unions were against it.  Young, mayor in the '70s and '80s, made room for a GM plant by confiscating private land through eminent domain.  Few could understand why he buldozed tax producing land when he could have given over acres of abandoned property, except that the residents of that neighborhood voted overwhelmingly against him.  Yes, white people with means fled Detroit for the suburbs.  But Sugrue glosses over that fact that middle class Black residents left as soon as the could too.  Southfield, a surburb township, is overwhelming Black and middle class, populated by those who couldn't stand the crime and corruption of Detroit.  Far from being an example of a typical post-industrial American City, Detroit is the exception.  It should be held up as a prime example of how not to run a city.  That being said, unless you've been assigned this book, don't read it.  Sugrue gives excuses and vague general reasons (aka racism) for Detroit's decline when the real problems are staring him in the fac 
 Maybe I made a mistake starting with a book that's 3rd in a series without reading the earlier ones first. I gave it up at page 118 as I just couldn't get engaged by the characters.  My previous experience with the Anita Blake series led me to this book hoping for a gutsy heroine and lots of action. There is action and descriptions of odd characters with extra eyes and magic skills. Guess I didn't make it to the sexy parts, as they mostly were talking about it, trying to be lyrical, but somehow the characters weren't coming alive for me so I gave it up.  I didn't want to pan this book entirely, knowing Laurell Hamilton's abilities, she might pull it together, but I just wasn't willing to keep soldiering on hoping for a turn around. 
 I expected more african vocals in it.. thats the main reason i brought the cd, i recently became a fan of that kind of music.. it had like 3 songs on there that i liked, besides that this album is garbag 
 I loved The Secret Life of Bees but I found this book to be formulaic and uninteresting.  Its difficult to like any of the characters, especially  the main character, and much of the scenes with the monk are sexually gratuitous. It has as much deapth as a Harlequin romance novel.  The relationship between her and the mother was a bit more dimensional but only slightly.  All in all, a poor follow-up to Sue Monk Kidd's break out bestseller.  Don't waste your time.  
 Buyer beware. I'm a Kitchenaid fan but these tools, while sturdy and elegant, are much too large for normal kitchen pots and pans. The slotted turner dwarfs a 6 or 8 inch frying pan. Likewise the slotted spoon is unusable in less than a four quart saucepan 
 Most of the criticism of this book seems to come from those who disagree with its argument, or those who didn't like the idea of reading a polemic.   Actually, I was at the outset sympathetic to the argument and enjoy a good rant; however I couldn't bear this book: the writing is appalling.  It is abolutely stuffed full of "knowing" references and  pop-culture slang.  Sometimes this creates the impression of trying to hide a weak argument in clever language.  Other times it's just plain irritating.    Let me give you an example, based on opening the book on a random page.  Here we go, pages 44-45:  - "I would affirm that yes indeedybob there are values the market can't compute or dictate..."  - "That crew [Marx and "his pal" Engels] was far better at how capitalism works than at coming up with policy-wonk recommendations."  - "Humanities geeks are more likely to be squishy-liberals and snail-darters."  - "Technolibertarians wouldn't really know how to grok a less quantitative/algorithmic weltanschauung.  It's C.P.Snow's two cultures antipathy taking a form he hadn't quite imagined."  Anyway, after gritting my teeth through a hundred pages of this I gave up.  The writing was just getting in the way of the argument.  Maybe the person I should be blaming is her editor.  Oh, and her sub-editor too: it's full of typos.  I know that's a pedantic thing to say, but how often do you read a good book with terrible spelling 
 This video has a long introduction and commercials. Commericials at the beginning and the end.  There is a lot of wasted time.  I found it an extremely inefficient use of my time--I am returning it today

 This novel employs weak and/or untenable character motivation to carry a ridiculous plot that presents itself as a "novel of ideas" but is in reality a pastiche of solipsistic ramblings and cullings from secondary sources.  As a novel of suspence, the narrative leaves loose ends and holes at nearly every turn, and the closure is so tepid I couldn't believe the diting could be so careless--one is led to think this "plot" is leading up to a climax, when instead what we get isn't even anticlimactic 
 Bought this micro in Jan., 2006 and by Oct. 2006 was having big time problems. This microwave oven is a fire hazard! The one I bought started arcing, like an arc welder, between the door and the body of the microwave. Sanyo's, "NO Custumer Service", was anything but helpful! Don't buy any Sanyo products since they are junk and they will not stand behind their product 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 I bought this and Bad Cats the other day, and I have to say Bad Cats was far better. Bad Dogs is cute, but a little stupid. Almost all of the photos are dogs wearing costumes. Bad Dogs? No, Bad OWNERS. Get Bad Cats instead 
 there was hardly any mention of Pixel the cat, it was alot of dialog, tried to resemble a fast paced action book, but I found myself skimming over alot of the text after a while.......for a female I like action and for the plot to move along........there was too much about dumb sexual innuendos about swinging, and multiple partner sex.I felt like the over tone to the book was "well ok we all have alot of sex with LOTS of different people in the future" it was too focused on that ...I liked "Stranger In a Strange Land" alot better. By the time I was through with this book I kind of felt almost like he was just slapping stuff on a page. 
 Google the words Foster Cline and Attachment Therapy, and be prepared to lose your lunch. Happy research 
 I just read this book to my little bro. Wow.  It's downright depressing when an author rejects her own instincts, and I really get a sense that Snyder rejected a part of herself to write this book. She wrote something the felt she OUGHT to write, not something that she genuinely wanted to write, and as a consequence, this book is about what kids ought to do, rather then what they actually do, or what is truely important to them.   I can really tell that the Egypt Game was inspired. But Snyder has since decided that her first book was too frivolous. Or at least it seems like she has.  In The Gypsy Game, Snyder tries to capture the essence of growing up.  The kids move away from imaginative play and assume responsibility in the real world.  But this is a ham-handed, teen-lit sort of way to finish things, and it truly devalues the original Egypt Game. It's as if the author believes that the children's game, and by extension the children's lives, were mere precursors to real life, and adult life. She says that imagination should give way to obligation.  This is a great way to describe the story, but it is also applies to the series itself. The imaginative Egypt Game gives way to the Gypsy Game, which is a book Snyder thought she ought to write, just to educate the nippers. Edifying fiction is rarely good fiction.  	 I think imaginative play does lead to adult responsibility, but it's effects are subtle. In fact, extended, consistent imaginative play usually produces a lot of artists, and...writers.  Snyder condemns herself with her own book. She forgets that things don't have to have a moral to be enriching. A children's game can slowly help kids become responsible adults.  A book for the sake of itself can help kids grow. In most cases, it's imagination that makes kids responsible and compassionate. They can't reject one to find the other. Imagination and responsibility must both occur simultaneously. GRRR 
 Why did they make Raistlin look like a total pansy. Of all the dragonlace writers...... Tracy Hickman is not all the grea 
 I expected more from the first true book I've read about this type of phenomena. The book should have been a third of its 398 pages, because in the end, all you have is a couple of people's stories, however compelling they are, to judge for their truthfulness.  The three cental figures connected to the Linda Cortile case won't reveal themselves, so we're left wondering if she made them up(by sending letters to the author) to further her sensational means.  There isn't any real evidence other than a xray that used to show an object in Mrs. Cortile's nose, which is no longer there, well, because the aliens took it out.  Hopkins conviction and analysis is compelling, as well as some interesting side stories.  But in the end, even if the events did take place, which is possible, what happened is kinda silly.  With obsessed top security agents, a wierd "world leader", and criss-crossing generational alien meetings, this should have preferably been a 30 page article 
 It's a beautiful book but it's poorly organized for those people unfamilar with all the Japanese ingredient. She refers to the same item by several names which is very confusing. Also she need to do a better job explaining what you need to have to prepare her recipes. She make a point of explaining the different types of miso but then just calls for "miso" in the reciepe. If you knew enough to understand what type of miso to use you wouldn't need her book 
 Butler says he writes from where he dreams, but this book comes from the head.  It's plotted and stale. Read "A Good Scent" and forget this one 
 The trust a young reader places in a writer is something to appreciate and value. Many young readers have been following this promising series for several years and have paid the writer with their return through a dozen books and waiting for the conclusion to this saga. The writer has commited the ultimate betrayal to his young readers in delivering this last book. The book is poorly written and reveals a very undisciplined writer. Perhaps it was too much success-too soon, or an editor who rushed this last book to publishing which led to this fiasco. It is disappointing that the writer did not value the many young minds who waited for the conclusion. The rambling shows the control of an alcoholic and the shoddy conclusion reveals a lack of creativity. It is clear that he did not give enough time and thought to develop something with more control and imagination. It is sad that many children will approach other serial writers skeptically after this miserable ending to the miserable series 
 Did everyone attempt to read the same book that I did? I only got about 20 pages into the novel and found that I had to stop reading it... why? This is the most poorly edited book I have ever read in my life! I found myself questioning my own reading ability in trying to read this book. Words, sentence structure, and tenses seem to be slapped together in a total attempt to be absolutely incoherent. Like I said, I started blaming myself - that maybe I was too tired when sitting down and reading this - but after showing other people the claptrap that seemed to plague the first 20 pages I realized that this book was desperately in search of an editor and, I hate to say it, a writer. If this is the style that Ramsey Campbell has evolved in to then I can seriously understand why he had to get a second job and work in a bookstore. 
 I have never actually thrown a book across the room in frustration - and I love books, so this is drastic!  Spoilers ahead - please don't read on if you haven't read the book.  I managed to (somehow) get through the first book, 'Wideacre', which I disliked - whilst I adore the rest of Gregory's novels, so this was hard for me - and grit my teeth and tried to read this book, the sequel as I'd bought it and it looked more promising.  It was 'marginally better' as one reader put it, than the first, but a very depressing and frustrating book indeed.  I was getting very angry and frustrated after the second half of the book - as many other readers have highlighted, Julia's consistent inability to stand up to Richard made it impossible for me to like her anymore.  I quite honestly wanted to slap her to wake her up from that dreamy state she was in!  Because I wanted so much for Julia to be with James - who I liked a great deal.  I was so depressed after everything went wrong and she didn't marry him... ah, because I was expecting the usually very clever Ms Gregory to surprise me and have a twist at the end and say, aha!  She does get her true love in the end and she and Ralph get rid of Richard and although it's not happily ever after she learns to grow a backbone and be the very first female heir to Wideacre.  The rape scene with Julia and Richard was very violent and far too detailed and I think it may be difficult to stomach for anyone who has ever been in an abusive situation like that, in fact, for anyone at all.  I don't want to get into the tricky area of abortion too much, but I really did feel strongly that Julia should have gone to Ralph for help when she concieved the child with Richard.  This was a child of incest and rape - and she knew in her heart there should be no heir for Wideacre - they were all simply too inbred and it needed to end somewhere for nothing was going right.  Clean slate, so to speak.  Yet she gives the child away - then in her final letter asks James to find the child?!  What?!  And I was expecting perhaps a deformed child, after all this inbreeding (I mean this child is the product of parents who are brother and sister AND grandparents who are brother and sister!!!) but she was perfect and beautiful.  I was hoping the gypsies would keep her and she'd never be found again.. but alas, the Lacey madness will live on...  The perfect end to this book would have been a nice twist.  Gregory could have made her very good point about inheritance rights and the lack of power women of Beatrice and Julia's era had by Richard being killed by Ralph, then Julia inheriting the land - baby Sarah is adopted out to the gypsies and never seen again and Julia either lives as a widow and runs the land or (this would have been lovely - I bet all the girls have sighed over James a little, didn't you?  he was a little like the handsome romantic leads in Austen's books) James forgave her - for they had both made mistakes and Julia's was not intentional nor her fault (I was practically screaming at her that it wasn't her fault - and she gets it in the end, when it's too late!) and they marry and have 'normal' children - or perhaps none, they just learn from their mistakes and respect each other, and make a fresh start for Wideacre.  There were so many allies that Julia had - she was a sweet girl and I liked her - I wish that I could have shaken her though, I got so mad.  So many people in the village offered their help - this trap she was caught in with Richard could have been avoided - ahhh... SO frustrating.  I will not be reading the third book in the series.  I shall go back to reading Gregory's more historic novels (A Constant Princess is one I haven't read yet and it sounds excellent).  I wouldn't recommend this one 
 If Dr. Phil had narrated his own book, the tapes would be great.  Disappointingly, he doesn't.  The fellow that reads is a complete mismatch of this material.  After 10 minutes, I couldn't take his voice anymore. I tried to be patient.  I tried to be tolerant.  Sorry, this voice just doesn't work. Not even close. Forget the tapes.  Read the book 
 I ordered this item some time ago and have not received the book.  
 Excuse me, but I see no literacy, historic wonder here, what I read of this piece of trash is:  this is a piece of obscene garbage!!!  Men with objects shoved up their butts, men forced and enjoying to perform explict graphic sex with other men, extreme cruelty, women having graphic sex with each other, women having their butts spanked and blistered.  WHAT PLOT!!!!!!  What I don't understand is how these series of books ever passed a censor and why they don't have some kind of warning on the covers. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a profound work of art, it is an excuse of writing.  It should be rated XXX and kept out of the hands of anyone under 21!!!  If booze is illegal before that age, then this vulgar sex book should be also. I don't care if this is Ms. Rice fantasy, she should keep to Vampires and leave her imagination on this field alone.   I can just see some weirdo sex offender feeding on this stuff for his performace on the next victom.  It can give any one ideas on how to hurt people in the real world,  There are enough bad things being done to others without fresh new ideas to apply to the world of cruelty.     
 I should know by now that anything Oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy.  But this tome pegs the Kumbayaometer.  I don't know what was worse, Morrie's trite, Godless, and lapsed-Jewish advice to "be nice to those we love" or Mitch Albom's profiteering off a friend's gruesome ALS death. What is it with America that we flock to this shallow I'm okay-You're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity?  Is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age? As a sidebar, what is it with Oprah and her ilk?  That a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic.  Safe to say, anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting Albom should be avoided and anything The Big O pushes should be rejected out of hand. By the way, I read this drivel in a Barnes and Noble while I waited for a phone call one afternoon.  If you must read it, get it at a library and keep the money from getting to Mitch 
 This book is badly written and not based on much logic. The arguments are entirely unconvincing 
 I'm sorry - generally I'm a fan of business stories, but this one really missed the mark.  In attempting to bring a sense of realism to his characters, it seems he focused too much on story plot and character development and not enough on the mechanics of politics and providing real examples of how to deal with it from all levels.  I want "take back to my desk" application.  This book fell short 
 One would imagine Mr.Warren having a very intense imagination and perhaps he might be able to embark on a carreer as a science fiction novelist. Actually this book would rate as a long and drawn out rendition of one. If  you want a more realistic outlook on the RAF / Bentwaters story , please  avoid this book and look towards Col. Halt's book. Otherwise this book is  fantasy at best 
 Difficult to read and out of date.  This book does not provide enough detail to facilitate an "understanding".  More of a narrative on other peoples' works, evident from the quotes and references throughout. 
 I'm a freethinking moderate, leaning toward liberal ideologies because they make more sense. I didn't really like farenheit 911 because of the irrelevant personal story of the lady at the end, but at least that story was TRUE. celsius starts out good, pointing out the fact that liberals try to brainwash people just as much as republicans do. they also pointed out france's real motive against Iraq war, which was as economical as America's assertion for iraq war. however, the end of celsius was terrible: they talk about the threat of iraq, bush as a leader, and kerry as a flip flop, but no evidence was provided, which makes them all republican propaganda. No true evidence was provided, and only a bunch of republicans were giving their opinions about why it was necessary to go into iraq. this one guy said, "There are WMD, period." Of course, even Bush says now there isn't, so you see how biased Celsius can be toward the end. Basically, farenheit would be more convincing to a rational person. Moore provided DOCUMENTS that DIRECTLY relate Bush to Saudi Arabia, and those things trouble me more than anything mentioned in celsius 
 I was attracted to the author's premise for this book, as I have recently been struggling with the conflicting moral perspectives from which colleagues can view the same issue.  But I found the book too confusing, and couldn't find compelling support for the author's hypotheses.    The book is framed as a Socratic dialogue among characters.  Although this style seemed plausible, the characters' personalities were not developed enough for me to distinguish them and identify them with their arguments.  Overall, the author's plausible premise was not supported clearly by illustration or research and I remain un-persuaded. 
 I have enjoyed several books by Anna Quindlen and looked forward to her latest offering. I settled down for an evening of reading 3 nights in a row before I finally gave up. I found the writing trite and boring. I didn't care about the characters as it took too long for them to become something. I'm wondering if this was something she wrote earlier in her career and tried to make a silk purse from a sow's ear. Rise and Shine? Not this time 
 This book is an excellent reference book for the serious ghost hunter / paranormal investigator. Provides good case histories as well as "ghost stories" that can be used as examples on investigations 
 I have yet to see a honest approach to this complex subject that does other than portray the Jews as victims.  There is never any acknolwedgement that all people and, yes, all races/cultures, at time do very bad things to each other.  Except for the Jews.  With them it is always someone else's fault. Even now, as they do their best to destroy the Palestinians, after invading their homes, stealing their dignity and turning Gaza into another Warsaw Ghetto, they refuse to admit that what they are doing is wrong.  And let's not forget that the Arabs are also semites, when we go throwing that "anti-semite" ajective around.  There are Jews who recognize and speak out on this problem, such as Norman Finklestein and Gore Vidal.  And there are, thankfully, Jewish run organizations in Israel who are fighting for the human rights of the Palestinians, realizing that it is the ongoing mistreatment of others, the continuing claim that Israel is above reproach, that is creating a negative image of Israel - they are doing this to themselves.  They are their own worst enemy.  
 I'm not sure what I expected after I purchased this for fifty some-odd dollars and was handed a coupon for a $40 rebate.  But I wish that someone had informed me before I lugged it all the way home that when you sing into the mic, your voice doesn't come through the speaker.  I'm cool with the machine's sound quality when it comes to playing a CD-G.  If I tap the mic, I can hear an extremely faint thud, so I know it's on, but the volume's too low--and, yes, I adjusted the mic controls--if you want to sing along. Which makes this a dinosaur: a boom box in the age of the iPod.    Really had to dig through the stacks of machines to find a box that hadn't been opened.  So, when was my first clue?  Doh 
 I was excited by this release, I mean, you can always use another King and I recording, but it's just not worth the purchase.  Everyone sounds like they're 85 years old with their warbaling vocals.  It would be worth buying if "Small House of Uncle Thomas" had not already been released on the much superior London Revival and Jerome Robbins Broadway.  
 This was the worst item I ever paid over $200 for. Maybe got 20 hours of use-at most. Mintek Digital did not back their product. I cannot believe that the positive reviews did not come from employees or shills for the company. Sent the unit to be fixed. Told me it couldn't be fixed and I should buy a new one or pay $10.00 to get this unit back. I recommend all users contact the Attorney General in their state to file a complaint about this worthless product and company 
 This book was a light read. The authors had a really good story line going and the plot had real potential. I liked the characters and was very interested in their conflict, however towards the end the story seemed rushed. The authors took a lot of time setting everything up and introducing us to the characters. The story leading up to the climax was very well written and kept me wondering what was going to happen next, but it disappointed me. It just seemed like they spent all this time on the book and then got tired of it so they finished it off real quick. It was, however, an ejoyable read. -indifferen 
 I found this book to be useless.  If you have attended any investment seminars like USAA, John Hancock, Fidelity etc. you get the same information.  Medicare and AARP free booklets likewise give the same information.  I was terribly disappointed 
 I read this book for the first time when I had been studying philosphy for about six months.  at the time I liked it, with my limited knowledge of the subject.  rereading it now Im not so sure.  Ok, Scruton writes good, and has a lot of points to make, and I agree on many of them.  What annoys me greatly, and not just about Scruton, but also with very many of the anglo-american philosophers are their understanding of so-called continental philosophy.  His short account of Foucault in this book shows almost no understanding at all of Foucaults ideas.  Its plain dumb, like many other "anglo-american" readings of "continental" philosophy.  spare me the self-referentially inconsistent arguments...sorry the outburst but its way off the point that Foucault, Derrida and others are trying to make.    To get back to the book, I still think its ok in many ways, but it needs to be read along with another book as counterpoint.  
 I was enjoying the travel parts of the book, despite numerous detours of self-serving/indulgent behavior by Mr. Crichton,until I reached the part where he was in Bangkok. He teams up with a journalist for a night on the town. His journalist friend suggests they go to one of the area's many brothels. Finally,  after testing the waters, the journalist excitedly drops his bombshell and  suggests a child whorehouse. Crichton doesn't dare to tell his companion what a loathsome creep he is or that he finds the suggestion repulsive and wants nothing more to do with him. Instead,he goes and checks the place out. He gives a description of tarted up six-year-old girls posing provocatively and being kept in line by geriatric prostitutes. Perhaps I'm just a prude but it seems to me that any normal decent young man would find the idea of sex with tots and grannies vile. I didn't expect Crichton to actually put a stop to all of this but he could have perhaps told the sickie to get some professional help or at least told him that kiddie sex wasn't his thing, instead he makes up some whiny complaint about a stomach ache and tells the guy to go ahead without him. This infuriated me and turned my stomach. I threw the book in the trash. I wish publishers had done the same. FYI, there is no zero star option 
 Don't make the mistake i did by buying this copy of this classic ITALIAN movie.It's a complete disaster with faded colors and grainy images.I can't beleive they put this one on the market.You'll get to see the three sketches  all right, but the transfer is simply amateurish and insulting.No subtitles,not even the original ITALIAN track,no gallery of photos etc.This is the worst dvd i ever bought.Luckily for others,a new version was released in 2005 which has the proper treatment.I just hope that VISCONTI's last movie THE INNOCENT won't fall in this category when they released it someday.Let us pray for the preservation of LAURA ANTONELLI's beauty 
 The low-fat craze that was the rage in the 1980s and 1990s is continuing to wane, due in part to the increasing obesity and the realization that "low fat" doesn't necessarily mean "more healthy."  This complete cooking light cookbook has recipies that, by and large, result in less flavorful and less "competent" cooking, with (in my opinion, at least) minimal "health" advantages vis-a-vis any reasonable cooking practices.  Take the chicken pot pie recipie in this book, for example.  Following this recipe results in a bland, very watery mess -- toped with hardened chunks of crust made with flower and butter.  Neither the filling, nor the crust, will leave you satisfied.  (Don't they test the recipes?)  Anyway, I gave it two stars for some low fat desserts that were not terrible.  A quick look through the Amazon.com collection of cookbooks will result in many better alternatives 
 garbo is radiant but there is no other reason to watch this highly abridged telling of tolstoys novel. while im used to hollywood (by necessityt) removing whole sections of a loooong book, this is incomprehensible to anyone who hasnt some previous acquaintance with the story. even the usually reliable fredric march and basil rathbone (one of the greatest hams ever) cant save it. 
 I am soooo glad that I checked this out of the library and didn't pay for this garbage. I really should of listened to the reviews on this book before I wasted a day reading it. Actually, about half-way through I skimmed. The first couple chapters weren't bad, but the rest was just awful.  Gracie, her ex-husband, her friends...they are the most pathetic, shallow bunch of fakes I've ever read about. What's even worse is that's the authors real life (maybe not the divorce part, but the rest of it).   In the end, all I have to say is DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!! I should of listened to the others, but I didn't, and now I regret that I wasted so much time when I could of been reading something worth while. 
 The section on spreadsheet is terribly outdated - obsolete even. It's  pretty much like a basic reference for financial modelling but does not  really provide the step by step approach to the topic. Sorry but I don't  think you will find useful tips on financial forecasting here 
 Two Federal Marshals are dispatched to a remote island housing a mental institution for the criminally insane to look for a missing patient named Solando.  Throw in a Hurricane that traps the Marshalls on the island, a lot of strange behavior, and you have the premise for Shutter Island.  The book does not live up to the expectations Dennis Lehane's readers expect from him (although looking at the other reviews I could be dead wrong about that).  There are glimmers of Lehane's talents, but the book feels like a rushed screen play.  There is action, there is mystery, there are menacing situation, but it is all very glossy and superficial.  The reader will also probably solve the mystery by page 150.  It is not all grim however.  The book does flow nicely, reads easily and the last 25 pages were very powerful emotionally.  I did enjoy the book, but would expect something like this from James Patterson (this would be an achievement for him) but not from a fresh talent like Dennis Lehane 
 First off, I love Dan Rather. He's a wonderful, passionate man whom I love to watch on the news. The problem is, he's not a writer. Not a very good one at least. This book is a noble attempt, but there is just so much that's wrong with it.  For one thing, there is just some bad writing in it. It has a lot of errors in fact and a lot of typos. Among others, he writes that Texas A&M University (rather than Texas Tech) is in Lubbock, and he says that Ryne Sandberg in in the Baseball Hall of Fame (he just should be soon). There is also bad grammar (this is beyond the Texas colloquialisms in the book which I think are fine-I'm a Texan myself). These are fairly small problems, but they are oftly annoying, and they are not good signs in a book written by a journalist who's supposed to report facts. Furthermore, he just has few narrative talents, at least not those required for a book. He tells the stories as a journalist on Headline News would--concise, to the point, and without much flavor. They're just there; the reader is rarely drawn in.  The most glaring flaw, though, is that there are a lot of flaws in logic in the book. For instance, one of the stories is about a ten-year-old boy who realizes that many of the underpriveleged at his school cannot afford school supplies, so he works together an organization that collects and disperses those needed supplies. This is all obviously a good thing. But then, Rather relates a joke told by the boy's mother who said she needed to haul the school supplies around so she "traded in [her] Lexus for a Durango, and now [she's] getting a Yukon because the Durango isn't big enough." My problem is the huge contrast here. On one hand, there are all of these kids lacking necessities and the heroes who are helping them are laughing about purchasing one expensive SUV after another for themselves. How is this inequality emblematic of the American Dream? How does this book manage to lament the rising poverty rates and terrible living conditions and still manage to promote excessive materialism? There are some people in the book who are praised for having overcome hardship to make millions (some of them stepping on other people's heads to do so) and others who are praised for having given up millions to help those in need. Frankly, these two "ideals" don't go together. Nevertheless, these people, according to Rather, have all attained the American dream. There are a lot of contradicting ideas expressed in these stories. Furthermore, I don't really think Rather has a great concept of what the American dream is. When Sister Sylvia Schmidt founds a homeless shelter in Tulsa, OK, I don't think she is following the American Dream. I think she's following dreams that go far beyond the American Dream, and I think she's rejecting the prevalent, primarily materialistic, concept of the American Dream of today's society.  I'm giving the book two stars because I like Dan Rather, and because some of the stories were rather inspiring. Neverthess, it's not a good book. I will continue to watch Dan Rather on tv, but I'm quite sure I won't read a book by him again 
 The language used in this book has a lot to be desired, especially for a book being read by children.  My thirteen year-old son started reading it for school.  He realized it was not something he should be reading and alerted me.  I then read the book and totally agree!  Also, the outcome of the story teaches kids that it is okay to cheat if you get away with it: For three years of high school, Simon and his friends cheat by accesssing exams on the school's computer.  The authorities suspect Simon until it is found that a teacher is allowing football players access to the school's computers using his password.  The football players view pornography on the internet and the teacher gets in trouble for permitting it.  Since these students had access to school information through the computers there is no way of finding out who was actually accessing and printing the tests.  Simon and his friends get off the hook and are never caught 
 This 600+ page endeavor in tedium has quite a few clever and witty observations about the current state of media, technology, etc., but is undone by the author's endless tone of self-congratulation and his complete inability to MOVE THE STORY ALONG. The plight of George and Lizzie is secondary to all of Andersen's cheeky observations and endless descriptive dreck. There's no sense rehashing the plot because there really isn't one. For a story intending to portray life in the modern fast lane, so little seems to actually happen, and it's hard to care about any of the characters since they serve mainly as props and time-killers in between the author's next clever zinger. Most of the time, the author's supposedly keen insight into the 21st century is no more than well-dressed but thinly-veiled cliches (this is particularly prevalent - and annoying - when the author shifts the setting out of New York City to the West Coast and shows his complete ignorance of anything outside the 212 area code), and you get the distinct impression that the author is writing just to hear himself talk. Fresh and invigorated at the start, it doesn't take long for Turn of the Century to wear thin and dwindle to a boring, lethargic crawl. All in all, a very disappointing read, since I was always a fan of his work in Spy Magazine. This is precisely the kind of "hip, cutting edge" fiction - with it's media barbs and heavy handed approach to social satire - which would fool critics into thinking the author really had something to say 
 This can opener is complete garbage.  Other reviews have told the story about how this thing does not work. I tried it three times, each time with new batteries, and it grunted to a stop after a millisecond.  Had to battle with the thing all three times, twisting and turning the stupid can opener to free it from its grasp on the side of the can. The seam broke and leaked juice all over the counter.  The "handy" screw to back the can opener up, was of very little use.  You are better off with a cheap electric can opener any time, or a hand crank can opener.  With this device, you might as well throw 20-bucks out on the lawn.  This piece of garbage ended up in the garbage.  Completely worthless.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY 
 Well Im a brit and grew up watching some episodes of this when it was shown originally in the UK. I got the first region 2 UK dvd a while back and was appalled by how bad it was. My beloved doctor who stands the passage of time much better.  BEWARE THE CHEATING MEMORIES OF YOUR CHILDHOOD 
 Can't give a review on Maximum PC.  Never received the magazine.  Instead I was sent the men's magazine FHM.  Please send my Maximum PC 
 I must admit that a misguided person gave me this book. Worse yet, she expected me to swoon and join her on my knees and pray for rapture.   Of all the foolishness that is damaging our world, LaHaye's products must be among the worst culprits. I managed to finish this book, and between laughter and rolling of eyes, all I can say is "DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY." 
 I bought this book mainly on the recommendations of other reviewers.  That was a mistake.  The book is a dull gleaning from unacknowledged secondary sources.  Lots of more or less accurate names and dates, but no depth analysis at all.  Style?  Try this: "The feeling that the arrests were a criminal act of unapralleled dimensions were felt at the time."  If you still want the book, don't buy it.  Let me know and I'll give you my copy 
 This was a total waste of money, it's a real cheapo like something out of a cracker jack box. 
 This was a complete waste.  Walken is good, but God what a waste!  I never finished Strieber's first book which had intrigued me.  But in succeeding books, he does nothing to prove anything.  He gives a tale of experience that borders on religion.  This horrible, suspenseless, and cheap film gives nothing to redeem Strieber nor his story as an unfunny joke.  Maybe I shouldn't be so harsh on it.  After all I'm not a UFO reasercher or whatnot.  But I'm still human.  I still have opinions.  And my opinion of this is, yuck 
 This refers to the double CD edition (not "Level 1"): Neither good dnb nor ambient. This compilation is likable after listenieng to it a few times but it lacks both originality and excitement in my opinion. Almost all tracks follow the same pattern, the drums are rather uniform making it sound like d'n'b has nothing more to offer. If you like smooth repetitive grooves than it may be your thing but if you want to listen to some good d'n'b check the likes of Roni Size or Talving Singh instead. There are a few pieces that have some interesting loops and rhythms and a good ambiental feeling to it (note though "So Long" on disc a seems to be influenced by #5, disc 1 on Selected Ambient Works vol.II by Aphex Twin) but these are few and far between to make up for the overall dull feeling of the compilation 
 This book is terrible.  The lists are disappointingly incomplete and inconsequential.  For example:  A list on tipping includes tips for restroom attendants, but it omits tips for valet parking.  In my life, I have used valet parking significantly more often than a restroom attendant.  A list of common foreign phrases omits pronunciations.  How useful is that?  Knowing the spelling of a phrase does one no good during conversation should the pronunciation of a phrase be very different from its spelling.  Basically, if one had been raised by kindly wolves in the forest, and recently dropped into modern society, this book might be marginally useful.  But anyone with a modicum of planning or forethought would have outgrown this trite little waste of words and paper by age 10 
 Look this album is old as i dont know what,this album wasnt even finished,they started on it like in early 2001,as far as tha production it will always be tight from paul and juicy-J,this was like an underground album,not like a world wide realease,thats why some will say its not that tight as production wise,it wasnt even through,thats why they put some of there old stuff on there with pastor troy and boo thats stuff is old,have u noticed that paul and others where just on hooks,some where supposed to be on there but paul took there verses off,because t-rock left over money and mic time,the album wasnt done,so there for they threw old songs on there cause he left,which was stupid because he would of gotten paid,so he left and now he aint getting nothing from this album,all that money is going to paul and juicy,t-rock is dumb,look tha unbreakables is gonna set tha world on fire its gonna be there hottest album to date watch,with boo gone u know they gonna have alot of superstars on there i would tell u but i got to go,if u dont believe me wait and see holl 
 While the class I took that used this textbook was informative, this book was full of what seemed to be the authors' personal opinons.  Like another person said here in the reviews about blame on the Bush administration, and lack of references aside from photo credits, this book seemed to be geared more towards giving you the biased outlook of the author than an unbiased view of environmental science.  I agree that this book is not fit for a college textbook, or any other type of education 
 Having just read the John Hammond bio that I purchased at the same time, I was not as impressed with this book. Even though I am familiar with many of the artists, it just didn't hold my interest that well. The author did seem to know his material, though. I just saw Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young again this summer. I wonder how they feel about each other now with so much gone on in decades before! It's a wonder more of these people didn't die of drug overdoses or std's! If you want an uplifting experience, this isn't for you 
 I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment.  Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.     Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.     In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.  This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend.  For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr. 
 THIS IS A GOOD CD, AS ELLIS IS ALWAYS GOOD.BUT TO GET THE REAL STORY, YOU MUST CHECK OUT 12'S IT. THE MUSIC ON 12'S IT WAS RECORDED BY A TRUE BAND THAT HAD BEEN PLAYING TOGETHER FOR SIX YEARS, AND IT SHOWS 
 Upon reading and studying this book thoroughly, I have to say I find that  while these two authors have expanded the original Carole Jackson's Color  Me Beautiful system to include 12 seasonal types rather than just the 4  original ones,which needed done,I agree,I think that this book lacked a  spark of something the origonal had even though it was not definitive  enough.I also did not find the color sample patches large or clear enough  to follow-they look like they were made with a wax crayon!I think that with  some re-doing, this book could be a real winner, but as it stands I have to  give it one less star than the origonal had.I am looking forward to reading  this book's update.. 
 Basically I'm a fan of B-Movie fantasy films as well as a long time DnD player. I can say that the movie by itself is really not that bad and I'd easily say that its not the worst B-Grade fantasy film ever made. However as a DnD movie it blows.  I'll never understand the need of filmakers to make a film based on something with a strong fan base and then change everything that the fans love about the subject. I can fully understand the need to change some things. This is a movie and unlike some purists I understand it is a different medium and sometimes things just have to be different. However this film bore almost NO resemblance to DnD. Fortunately when the sequel (Wrath of the Dragon God) was made this was fixed.   Basically a good movie just not a good dnd movie. If you can get over that fact go ahead and watch it for the somewhat ok B fantasy movie that it is. 
 First off, there will be spoilers so if you want to read this book and don't like to know anything before you read it (like me) then don't read on!  What was this? I love Wendy Wasserstein as a playwright. I couldn't wait to read this book! I thought that it would be a witty satire on New York's "finest" (not the firefighters, the Upper East Siders) after 9/11. I was sorely mistaken.  The first few chapters are delightful and engaging, but soon, you long for the book to go somewhere... 307 pages later you shut the book realizing that it never did!  The political agenda being pushed was nauseating. I daresay it bordered on propaganda!   I liked not one character in this entire book- not one. At the beginning I thought that this was so that Ms Wasserstein would make a point later... SHE NEVER DID.  You can tell Wendy was an excellent playwright from the vivid descriptions of scene. It was written very visually.  I hate to say it, but this book's critical acclaim comes only from Ms Wasserstein's previous success as a playwright and her untimely death. Had she lived she would have discovered that she most certainly wasn't a novelist and should have spent her time writing what she is truly genious at- plays 
 This product is a box o' junk.  My son got this for Christmas this year and it is not even worth whatever the person paid for it.  The hat fell apart within three days (and he hardly played with it - just wore it on his head a few times) - the metal rim around the hat came undone and now there is a sharp metal point sticking out through the cloth on the hat, which is obviously dangerous.  I contacted the company and they have not responded.  
 Of course Stossel can talk big about busting them "liberals" but his book makes no sense about it because he admits that he never intended to bust them but instead join them. Ever wonder why ABC hires such kooks while rejecting talented youths? Ever wonder why Stossel says that the best way to punish them elites is to give them more tax breaks? This and his other book make even horse manure smell not as bad  
 This is a terrible book to read. The author sought to give insight of 1979 revolution in Iran, the author failed beyond recognition.  The author of the book cliamed that no one knew who was mullah Khomenie, he was an obscure political figure. However, in 1963, when King of kings Mohammad Reza PAHALVI introduced "White Revolution" an end feudalism in Iran. Khomenie, Tudeh party, and emporium people were not happy about the "white Revolution". As a result, there was a riot in Iran and Khomenie was apprehended and exiled from Iran. When he was in France, Pan-Iranist leader, and Nationalist leader went to his house and asked for his safe return to Iran and declared him as an opposition leader of Iran. Dr. Shapur BAKHTIAR government collapsed and Khomenie did not apporve his government. All in all, public was aware of Mr. Khomenie and there was no element of surprise. The 1979 revolution in Iran took place because there was promise of economic advantage for people.  When Khomenie was in France he was advised by people like Bani Sadr, Chamron. They knew what they were saying.  The author accused Khomenie as an agent of West. The author did not provide any supporting evidence against Khomenie as an agent of West.  Truly, the author of the book failed on faith of Zoroastrian. The Zoroastrian faith promotes worshiping one God. Zoroastrian faith does not worship light [page 28] nor fire. There is a matter of fire in Zoroastrian faith, which requires in depth reading.   Last, correcting the author of the book, dualism, Good and Ahriman do not compete with each other. Good and Ahriman are in conflict with one another. What is Zurvan? What does Ahura Mazda mean?   The author of the book needs to read books which are written by Iranian intellectuals. Forget what West says, what you say matters. We are Iranian and that is what matter most.  
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 i bought this stuff trying to save a few bucks b/c it claims to be better than proactiv. after using proactiv for a month, then trying this stuff, acnefree doesn't compare to proactiv. granted, this is better than a bar of soap, but it's definately worth spending the extra $20 to get proactiv. 
 Unfortunately, there seemed to be no recourse after I ordered this for 2 newphews as a Christmas gift, and it did not arrive.  I tried to send an email to amazon.com but got bumped to someone else (distributor?) who never responded.  So disappointing since it was a gift for someone else.  Happened not once, but twice 
 For me this movie is a painfull thing to watch. I wish that I could give this 0 stars. The infamous fake "O" scene kind of recked true intamacy for me. It may be true that women do this but it is one of the worst kind of lie imaginable.   One of the truths for us guys is that when we are cuddiling with a woman we fanasise that we are with the first girl we fell in love with.   Just FYI.   
 Has nobody seen through Scorseses weak plots yet?  He makes one exellent gangster film (Goodfellas which after all was based on a book) then repeats the same formula for almost every other film.  So we have the Italian mafia in Goodfellas, the Jewish mafia in Once upon a time, back to the Italians but change location for Casino and now we have the Irish and 'native' mafia.  So what next for Scorsese when he runs out of ethnic groups for his mafia films?    This film lacks everything.  Loosely based on historical facts its slow, dull and only made vaguely interesting by the odd input of horrific violence (just as all of his gangster films are, the start of Goodfellas, the baseball bat scene in Casino etc)  Sorry but this film lacks everything. 
 I bought this book thinking it would help my Arthritis and aid me in losing weight. I was so wrong.  The food was totally unpalatable. I could not even gag it down. I was hungry ALL THE TIME. I ate and ate and ate. My skin ,which was already dry, became like parchment paper.  I developed bumpy skin on the backs of my arms and on my thighs. I had no energy. It was the worst diet I have ever been on (and I've been on them all). Don't waste your money on the Mcdougall books. A better one would be Dr. Mary Enigs book, Eat Fat, Lose Fat. I went on this one and added cod liver oil to my diet and I lost 125 pounds in just under a year with almost NO hanging skin. This diet is rich in fat soluble vitamins which nourish the skin. I was never hungry and the bumps on my skin and my arthritis cleared up completely. This is the real way we are supposed to eat. Even if you think eating lots of saturated fat is bad, get the book anyway, by the time your done reading it, you will be a believer because you'll understand how and why the body uses nutrients the way it does. A book everyone should read. If I could give the Mcdougall books a '0' I would 
 This is a product of the lazy, latter-day Leonard who knows he's a great writer who can just sit back and let it flow. The onetime master of concision now takes a hundred-odd pages just to set things up.  Even his ear for dialogue has started to fade on him. Now everybody like, y'know, talks like, uhh, some kinda boob, get what I'm sayin'? The line of self-parody is lying a little too close in these pages.  He still has a hand with the quirky minor characters, though they can't carry an entire 350-page plus novel. But this one did make it clear to me why Leonard is so popular with the pomo crowd: his characters inhabit an utterly amoral universe, one with no values or standards whatsoever. Here, e.g., the protagonist is that well-known figure drawn from life, the friendly, easygoing loan shark. In your traditional crime novel--Chandler or either MacDonald can serve as examples--the action occurs against a hard-edged moral framework that is at least given lip service. Now I won't demand that every piece of fiction act as a morality play. But this was a case where I finished the thing, and kind of enjoyed the ride, but didn't like myself for it. In Leonard's recent novels, all that matters is who gets to take home the candy. And when you get right down to it, that just ain't enough. 
 The author takes a look at a baker's dozen of well known musicians and points out Christian elements in their works. In some cases this is more apparent than in others. However, it is much more apparent that the author has a politically liberal, anti-American axe to grind. Negative comments aimed at Republicans and anything related to them appear at unexpected and unnecessary moments. The putrid low point was contemplating the cause of 9/11 as being America's fault. Sadly, the author's take on an interesting premise is sandbagged by biased political commentary.  
 The book is somewhat entertaining, but reading it you realize that the author  doesn't know much about the subject. The part about 18 century was so unrealistic with things like lipstick, iced tea or bath tab, that I was really surprised the characters didn't use computers in that time period 
 Fortune 500 HR executives do in fact give tips for resumes and cover letters in this book. But if they possess the magic key to getting an interview, they don't share it. Readers won't get the interview everytime because the advice is tired and common: list your experiences and education on your resume; attach a cover letter. Basic online job hunting tips have been layered on top to make the advice seem fresh. It's not. And if it worked, there wouldn't be any need for newer strategies such as the "accomplishment" strategy (at least you prove that you were useful to a business) and the "self-marketing" strategy (much more aligned with a business's needs). As an employer, I want to know what a candidate will do to bring profit to my business and peace of mind to me. It's that simple. I don't want to infer or guess.  And, contrary to what this book implies, I am more receptive to candidates who show initiative and creativity 
 On the front page The Times is quoted to have written: "Extremely funny!". I didn't have one laugh. Not even a smile. I think that says it all. Let me add that the writing is not bad, but the main theme of the book is almost stupid, sometimes disgusting and certainly boring. And the story contrived and exaggerated. The background story of the Ukrainian family having suffered through the Stalin's regime and WWII concentration camps is more interesting, but is too sporadic to improve the overall impression 
 I rank this book slightly higher than Season of the Machete, simply because I only got to page 25 of that book before giving up on it. I finished this book, but it was hardly an enjoyable read. The one positive is that the chapters are very short, so it feels like the novel moves along at a nice pace. The actual content, however, is very poor. This book is just surviving off the past Cross novels. If someone was just picking up this book having not read any of the prior Cross novels, they are just not going to understand or care about the subplots involving Cross's estranged son, his other two kids, this new love life, etc. I've read all the books leading up to this book, and I barely cared or understood what was going on.   Compare this to Kiss The Girls or Jack and Jill, and it comes up way short. The story and the plot are very thin and very disjointed. Nothing about this book keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you will only feel compelled to finish it if you are a completist. This was by far the worst of the Cross books. 
 I heard the author discussing this book on NPR and was fascinated by the premise.  However, just as a cook may have all the necessary ingredients on the counter, if s/he doesn't mix them together properly and allow to simmer until just right, the meal can be ruined.  This is what happened with Brad Meltzer's THE BOOK FATE.  He had all the makings of an excellent thriller:  inside details on the life of a former president, information on presidential libraries, facts about the inner workings of the CIA, FBI, and Secret Service, travel and intrigue, and some vaguely interesting though random information about Freemasonry.  When he stirred it all together what he ended up with was a weak concoction lacking spice or salt and full of superfluous ingredients that didn't need to be there.   The back cover of the book compares Meltzer to David Baldacci, Scott Turow, and John Grisham.  These writers know what to do with the ingredients to turn out one fantastic dish of a book; Meltzer's BOOK OF FATE is a heavy, overstuffed souffle that refused to rise 
 The only remotely inspired thing on this morose album is Fish Out Of Water, not that I have nothing against Curt. Raoul was much better 
 Too self-consciously artsy-fartsy for my taste.  This is the sort of movie pretentious people love since it allows them to make a big show of pretending to appreciate something "challenging" that a general audience would not "get".  If you don't have that sort of agenda when watching a movie, however, you might want to stay away from this one.  It's deliberately obscure in many places, to the point of self-indulgence and beyond.  There was enough in it for me to care vaguely about the Pullman and Byrne characters, but I still felt like I had just wasted 2 hours by the end.  It seemed much longer 
 A one-off collaboration between ex-Japan bassist/multi-instrumentalist Mick Karn and ex-Bauhaus vocalist Peter Murphy, this one never quite reaches the elvel you'd hope it does.  The two of them don't ever quite blend together, stylistically-- essentially, Karn sets up a number of moods, similar in voicing to his first solo record ("Titles") or the last Japan album ("Tin Drum") and Murphy sings over them.  Murphy seems out of place here-- this is a far cry from Bauhaus-like gothic music and further still from the sort of pop that he'd succeed so well with in the near future, and he doesn't always seem to know what to do.  Evidentally the project started as mailing tapes back and forth and fell apart when the pair got into the studio.  Mind you, when he does succeed, the results are breathtaking-- the opening couple tracks, "Dali's Car" and "His Box" both feature brilliant bass playing from Karn and a totally off-kilter and bizarre vocal from Murphy, but the album fizzles out after that, between dull ("Cornwall Stone"), ill-conceived ("Create and Melt") and totally forgettable ("Moonlife" and the instrumental "Artemis", which would not have been out of place on Karn's previous record).  The closer and single from the album, "The Judgement is the Mirror", fares somewhat better, but lacks any real energy.  Overall, this album just didn't work-- its an odd record and has its moments of beauty, but it doesn't move me like much of the work from Karn and Murphy separately have 
 Marcus Borg may be the most reasonable member of the Jesus Seminar. His books on the "historical Jesus," while I think deeply mistaken (as I explain in my book, Why the Jesus Seminar can't find Jesus, and Grandma Marshall Could), do demonstrate intelligence, learning, and often worthwhile insight into one of the traditions he compares in this book. Since he does not claim to be a Buddha scholar, it might seem reasonable to cut him some slack. After all, many of the quotes he gives from Jesus and Buddha do sound similiar. And there is no denying either the charm of Borg's gentle approach, or of many of the quotes themselves.   However, Borg's approach is amateurish and naive, making his conclusions deeply misleading.   To begin with, Borg stacks the deck. He does not compare Buddha's teachings on the evils of making love to one's wife (in the sutra called "Defeat") with similar passages from Jesus, or Jesus' confrontations with political critics with similar problems encountered by Buddha, because such parallels do not exist. Borg only selects points that enhance his argument. But Borg admits that, so perhaps we can let it slide.   More seriously, really Borg does not compare Jesus and Buddha at all. He compares a whittled-down selection of Jesus sayings, written within a few short years of the Master's life, with a vast library of Buddha material written by all kinds of people over several hundred years. At one point he says, "One might even say that becoming a bodhisattva is the goal of the fully developed Christian life." Never mind that this Mahayana concept only appeared half a millennia after Buddha! Such comparisons are worse than meaningless. If I sifted 150 years of Marxist tradition, I could easily find sayings that parallel passages in the Gospels -- but setting them side by side would not mean that the real Marx taught his disciples to turn the other cheek.   Why does Borg not compare the historical Jesus to the historical Buddha? The real reason, aside from the fact that he is admittedly an "amateur" on Buddha, may be that our earliest sources are too remote from Siddhartha to be sure what he was like. In the Dharmapadda, Buddha appears as a kind, gentle thinker like the present Dalai Lama. In other sutras, he is a hippy who leaves home in search of a better commune. Elsewhere he brags like the vain Bagwan Rajneesh: "I am the Tathagata, the teacher of gods and men, omniscient and endowed with all powers." The various Buddha materials do not come from the same century, let alone the same man. Borg is trying to clap pretty solid historical materials (Jesus in the Gospels) against empty air (sutras that do not in fact come from Buddha at all).   The critic who replies that the ministry of Buddha was longer, so more materials would be available for his life, is just missing the point. After a few centuries of oral tradition and free creation of new sutras, in a culture that did not (like the Jews or Chinese) emphasize historicity, it is hard to figure out from the resulting libaries of material what Buddha actually said, or even was. The same is simply not the case with 1st Century writings by Jewish followers of Jesus, written within the natural life-spans of his first disciples, that show strong internal and external markings of basic historical accuracy. (As even the JS often admits.)   Thirdly, some of the parallels here seem to owe more to similarity of wording than intent. While the Gospel may call a Christian to "hate" his family in the sense of putting God first, Jesus' early disciples do not seem to have left spouse or offspring, as Buddha taught his disciples to do. By "salvation" Buddha means freedom from rebirth, while Jesus means a new birth from Heaven.   What is left of these parallels? Probably "compassion" was important both to Jesus and to Buddha. But from the 1st Century, Christians have not only admitted, but insisted, that moral truth, what C. S. Lewis called the "tao" (following Confucius), is universal. Of course Buddha taught kindness; what else would anyone with a conscience teach? But such a beautiful source of Buddhist compassion as the Dharmapadda contains no hint that Buddha did any miracles. There is little historical evidence that he was a "person of the spirit" in that sense.  Several reviewers say this book is not for scholars. Actually, some of the quotes in it may intrigue anyone. But no one with integrity, scholar or layman, should read too much into such forced parallels.   Marcus Borg ought to know better. His arguments about  "people of the spirit" should rest on serious scholarship. In a sense, though, Borg does truth a service, by showing how far afield one needs to go to find parallels to the Gospel story, and how weak those parallels prove, when tested critically. 
 It is claimed that the Bush administration is loaded with neo-conservatives, supposedly followers of Strauss, who is known as the preeminent natural rights philosopher. So, do natural rights have a thing to do with their policies? First one must find out what a natural right is.  Alas, one turns to Strauss' basic work on the subject. My hat goes off to anyone who can figure out what a natural right is if they have the perseverance to wade through this book. "Obscure" hardly does justice to the convoluted, indecipherable writing of the author. In lieu of clearly outlining a coherent theory of natural rights, the author is most intent on skewering historicists, followers of Max Weber, modern liberals, and others who rely on what men have come to understand about society and thereby fashioned rights.  The idea of a natural right is bizarre anyway. The biological imperative to survive in nature is hardly a right. It's hard to see civilized society being built on the workings of raw nature: the utter harshness would have to be overcome. However, once two or more men come to agreement on behavior and rights, that agreement is relative to them and is not natural, though it may be practical or wise. Of course, the author disdains positive law, or man-made law. The idea that reasonable and self-moderating behavior is pre-social is pure delusion.  But it is interesting to see the dynamics of power with a good mixture of propaganda and ignorance being purified by subtly suggesting that those machinations are connected to philosophies of natural rights. That thinking is at least as obscure as the master's work. 
 I was looking for a book that is not as detailed and complex in its description as that of a history atlas, but also one that is not as shallow and perfunctory in its survey as that of a textbook targeted at high school students. "A History of Civilizations" satisfied the above criteria but failed to evoke in me any sense of satisfaction after reading the book.   Instead of the usual way of simply chronicling events, Fernand Braudel decided to approach the subject matter from the perspectives of geography, history and significant periods in the evolution of the civilization. A pretty innovative approach, I thought. But in so doing, not only did he miss out on important details in the content, he fell short of conveying what meager ideas that he had left in a lucid and effective way. He assumed that the reader has sufficient background information and hence plunged right into the `deep end' of the subject matter. The already mind-boggling reading experience was worsened by the choppy, inadequate translation of the original French writing. The lack of illustration, annotations, maps/diagrams will contribute to the bewilderment, and not the enlightenment of the poor reader.  If you were to buy this book, just read Chapter 1 (a general review) and the chapters on Islam, Latin America, USA and Russia. The rest of the book is not worth your effort getting mired in the entanglement of information (or rather, lack of information and insights) and having to bash your way through. Furthermore, the book was written two decades ago, and hence the information presented is not up-to-date. Well, treat it as a `time capsule' of facts then. 
 I picked up this book by chance while looking to solicit blurbs for my own 'hilarious' book, Love Song for W (ISBN 0595311911). After scanning the entries for about 15 minutes, I knew I was in trouble. Even without going through the formality of sending out mail and having it returned, you can tell that many addresses don't pass the smell test. Several entries are clear victims of sloppy cut-and-paste work, leaving in data from other listings. (Either that, or Bill Gates really does live on One Microsoft Way, right in the heart of Los Angeles, as we're told here. And I haven't watched Letterman in a while, but I'm pretty sure that Stephanie Seymour doesn't have any affiliation with 'Worldwide Pants, Inc.' Trust me, the ASPCA won't let one of Axl Rose's paramours anywhere near Stupid Pet Tricks.)  Maybe I'm being too harsh... then again, what else can you say about a book that tells us Toby 'McGwire' is a baseball player living at '250 Stadium Drive' in St. Louis. (For that matter, I don't even think that MARK McGwire lays his hat there these days, either. He's too busy pleading the Fifth before Congress while shedding a lonesome tear, reminiscing about the good times when he and his Mafia drug-dealer played Liar's Poker with C-Notes, the loser getting a steroid-laced beating he'd never forget.)  Need more? How about a 368-page book that wastes TWO entries on the Shue Family? (Everyone who's still worrying about Billy and Allison from Melrose Place, raise your right hands.) How about numerous entries that are clearly addresses for studios or agencies but leave the company's name to your imagination? Would it be too much to leave in 'c/o Paramount,' for instance? You might as well send out your Valentines to 'Brad Pitt, Hollywood, USA,' not far off from 'c/o Santa Claus, the North Pole.'  If you really need to contact centers of influence, your best bet is to sign up with an online company that will bill you month-to-month and will actually have a staff to make sure the addresses are more accurate than 'Fidel Castro, P O Box 361, Cuba.' (I'm not making these up, by the way. Did I mention the political listings that display an obvious leaning to the Libertarian side? No wonder the book is sloppy -- the author was legalizin' it!!)  I hate to say it, but it really feels like the flunky they hired from the data-entry temp agency just didn't put their heart and soul into the project. And if they can't get excited about their work, who can 
 I bought a blue one.  The mug looks nice enough, but it cracked the first time I filled it with hot water for tea. Get your act together guys -- it really is not so difficult to make dishes that can withstand a little heat. As for the claim that this can go in the microwave...after the mug cracked, I didn't bother to try 
 Back in the 70s, we hadn't yet learned to "just say no."  Perhaps that's why some people liked _Mystery Train._  Rampant drug use is the only possible reason anyone might find this gibberish interesting or enlightening.  It's so absurdly overwritten, so pompous, and so empty of actual meaning as to be beneath contempt.  This is, to books about music, what "Plan Nine From Outer Space" is to sci-fi movies 
 If I am not mistaken,this is Jonathan Kellerman's third book involving a suspect religious cult.  It gets a little tiresome.  The plot was not as suspenseful as his books usually are.  But it is easy reading, and the writing is entertaining enough to read if you are a Jonathan Kellerman fan 
 James Chace does a great job in listing all kinds of facts and anecdotes about Dean Acheson and his contributions to American Cold War policy. (I think that his book is the only true comprehensive biography on Mr. Acheson out there, too. 
 Time has revealed that this album is not very good. Above The Law had one good album in them, this is not it 
 Hope Edelman's book is successfully part memoir and part academic study. She has chosen a narrow scope for her research, and that's fine--that is, until she feels the need to dismiss other related topics (such as the equally intimate bond between granddaughters and paternal grandmothers) by claiming that they are just not as significant instead of acknowledging that she simply did not choose to research them. The second hole in Edelman's research comes when she refers to how maternal grandmothers live longer than paternal ones--where the basis for this statement? I'll believe it when I see it. It's absolutely fine for her to choose to focus specifically on mother to mother to daughther generational relationships; what's not fine is for her to casually brush off related relationships as though they just don't matter as much. Within the context of her thesis, they are not as significant, but this is something that Edelman needs to address instead of pretending that she didn't write about them because they are not as significant. Other than these two crucial holes, Edelman's book holds merit in its well-written accounts of family, both from her own life and from her case studies. It's worth a read, not so much for its actual insights, but perhaps for the insight that it inspires its readers to pursue on their own 
 I am a huge fan of most of the Tasty Bite meals. I'd tried almost all of the Indian flavors and had never been let down. I ordered the Green Curry meal without ever having tried it before based on the good reviews here and my past experiance. Unfortuantly, I found it to be nearly inedible. The rice is clumpy and unpleasant and the spicing was just... wrong. I love Thai Green Curry, and this tasted nothing like it. I still recommend the Indian Tasy Bite Meals, but track a box of this down and sample it before you commit to a pack of 6. 
 It seems to me that this author had only two good novels: Hemlock Bay and Riptide.  The rest of them lack character depth and even a decent plot.  The writing is rudimentary.  There are better authors out there 
 I failed to realize that this was a book "edited" by as opposed to written "by" David Sedaris until his introduction. Incidentally, the introduction was the only portion of the book that I actually enjoyed. His analogy about his favorite song in middle school is not accurate in that his classmates did not have to  pay to learn his affinity towards what may have been a bad song. I do not find it endearing that he does not care what others think of his tastes.  I do not think they were bad stories. Actually, I would like to take that back, if entertainment is a measure of quality to me they were bad. It was, however, impressive how one of the writers was able to use most of the GRE vocabulary words in one short story.   I will not stop buying the books that David Sedaris authors, I will just be more careful. David Sedaris is a brilliant writer/storyteller. He may not capture all or even any of the elements of a "good" short story; I would not know an element of a good short story if I ran into one coming off the elevator. I do know that David Sedaris' stories are excellent in that they are entertaining and make no pretense of intellectualism. I can not wait for the next book he actually writes 
 I didn't think that Manning books could get lower than Wrox, but I was very wrong.  Unless you are doing very, very simple Hibernate 2 or want to how to use XDoclet and Ant, this book is a waste of money. If I were the authors, I would return the money to the publisher. You can forget in depth examples.  This book has the most trivial of examples, but it does have pages and pages of exposition on why Hibernate is so cool.  The real meat could be put into a 12 page booklet.  With a publish date of 2006, this book needs to be more up to date. To make matters worse, some diagrams are incorrect, many pages are smudged and smeared and the book reads as an insult.  I remember the days when computer books were actually helpful and useful, this book brings modern tomes to yet another new low. I thought the on-line docs for Hibernate were bad, but this book is worse.  Wow.  Worse than Wrox AND worse than the on-line docs.  Makes me want to read an old VAX manual just for the fun of it.  This is the first and VERY last Manning book I will ever buy. The few I have read before I was able to get the gist by spending 20 minutes in the bookstore reading.  Peak and Heudecker should stick to creative writing as that is what thy do best in this book 
 This release is boring. What passes for angst is mere whining. Any hooks are few and far between. If a melody should occur, it's telegraphed well in advance by the guitars. It's sort of a musical equivalent of a dying lawn mower - there's a lot of racket but it can't cut it. Sixteen Stone is just what we didn't need more of in the mid-90s: One dimensional primitive blockhead raving. Makes a great coaster, though 
 This book presents itself as a "basic worldview catalog."  While it does cover many of the major themes it is heavily tainted by the authors inability to see things from anything but a Christian perspective.  A quote from the end of the book says it all in my mind: "In terms of possible worldviews, our options are numerous but, as we have seen, limited.  Of those we have investigated, all but theism were found to have serious flaws."  While no worldview is perfect, to not see the flaws in theism requires a very blinkered view of the world and this shows its self again and again through the book.  If you want to read something that tells you why Christianity is the best worldview there is - go ahead and buy it.  If you want something more objective I would look elsewhere.  
 Much repetition and too little of artists neither western nor white...or male for that matter. Though the sections are a lovely idea the same art is used in each. A not terribly risky venture, this 
 I bought this Samsung model in September because of the superior picture and excellent glare reduction.  It went black the day before the Super Bowl.  It is now NCAA playoffs and it has not been repaired or replaced. The service technician has tried 3 times to repair, now having replaced every component.  I am finally on a replacement list with no ETA.  The Samsung Customer Service reps have been unhelpful and unconcerned.  The repair technician is the only person who has apologised and tried to push Samsung - with no success 
 I really did'nt like this book at all. I think that it is a very confusing and lame story. Sorry no hard feelings. I mean there was nothing there to keep me motivated and interested in reading it. You talked alot about Econ throughout the story which I thought was very cool, just for the simple fact this is for my Econ class. Its like your telling life time stories about yourself and others. You sure do have alot of characters throughout the book. Overall I think that the book is okay its just not a book for me 
 Although solidly made, this is a VERY SMALL whisk.  Nine inches sounds big, but this will only suffice for whisking 2-3 eggs, or for those occasions when you don't want a full sized whisk.  I was disappointed in it when it arrived.  It's not what you want if you think it's a regular sized whisk 
 I ordered this product almost two weeks ago and it is not even shipped yet 
 In almost every actor's career, there are some early film efforts that were clearly done just for a paycheck. If these actors had their way, these movies would be wiped off of the face of the earth and never mentioned again.   Actress Alyssa Milano (who got her start on the hit 80's TV show Who's the Boss?) made quite a few of these type of movies early on in her hit/miss (but mostly miss) movie career. Most of them were essentially sub-par soft-core erotic thrillers (like Embrace of the Vampire) that just basically sucked on almost every level. Others were actually pretty good like Confessions of a Sorority Girl. Some may argue that she may have been trying to shed her wholesome image from her prior TV show Who's the Boss but I think that she was just desperate for work and would take anything she could get her hands on, no matter how bad the script was. Either that, or she actually thought that these were supposed to be good films. If that was the case she ought to slap her agent during that period!   A friend of mine recently lent me her 1995 film Poison Ivy 2: Lily on DVD with the recommendation that it was good on a so-bad-it's good level. All I can say is that it was just bad on every level and actually made most USA Network sleazefests look pretty good by comparison.   The film is a sequel (in name only for the most part) to the 1992 cult classic that starred a decidedly very sexy & 17 year old Drew Barrymore in the lethal nymphette role of Ivy. On a guilty-pleasure level the original movie worked due to the movie's reliance on solid acting instead of just wall-to-wall sex and nudity.   Poison Ivy 2 involves Lily (Alyssa Milano) who is an art student/painter from Michigan who has just arrived in California to start attending an art school. She quickly finds a house that has a room for rent and quickly moves in. She starts attending her classes and quickly catches the attention of a male classmate. They start going out and it soon becomes obvious that Lily's much older (and married with a child) teacher has the hots for her as well and develops an unhealthy infatuation on her. Lily ends up inexplicably finding a hidden diary and nude photos from a girl named Ivy (presumably the one from the first film) and immediately becomes fascinated by Ivy's wild and free sexual ways. Lily immediately begins to start dressing in very revealing clothes and basically acting like a tramp, much to the surprise of her boyfriend (who doesn't mind one bit.) Her teacher ends up talking her into letting him paint semi-nude portraits of her and before too long he can't resist his urges and starts trying to force her into having sex with him. She tries to refuse and eventually her boyfriend catches on and gets disgusted with her. She tries to confront her teacher about it at her house and he tries to practically rape her in the main hallway (while his wife and young daughter are home no less). His daughter and wife catch them in the act(WHOA!! I didn't see that coming!)and the little girl inexplicably runs out into the street and gets hit/killed by a car(!). Everyone exchanges some heated words and the movie ends.   The plot, as you can tell, is predictable and thoroughly generic. Probably the worst part is that the running time of the movie is an unbearable 108 minutes. Most of the scenes go on ridiculously long and will more than likely cause unsuspecting viewers to doze off periodically.   All of the actors involved look like they were blackmailed into making this movie. Alyssa Milano is there purely for the skin factor and all of the other cast trudge through their roles looking like someone slipped valium in their meals/drinks.   As is almost always the case with direct-to-video skin flicks, Poison Ivy 2 is available in both unrated and R-rated versions. The DVD I watched included both the R and unrated versions of the movie on the same disc as well as offering a choice between widescreen or full frame viewing options. The only version that I checked out was the widescreen unrated version. According to the back of the DVD box, the R-rated version looks to be missing around 2 minutes of explicit sexual content. To be honest, I couldn't really tell what about the uncut version caused the MPAA to demand cuts. Out of the whole film there are probably literally only 2 1/2 minutes of footage that feature any sort of nudity or sexual content. Even when sex does occur it's so poorly lit and the editing is so choppy that not that much is really shown. The sex scenes are also pretty brief for this dubious genre. There's one in particular that's good for a laugh in which a guy who is lusting after her confronts her in his room at some goofy party. (It is rumored that this particular scene originally contained an explicit shot of Alyssa simulating oral sex on the male actor who played her boyfriend but that she forced the distributors to take that shot out of the film. The very beginning of this scene is present as you see her head makes its way down, but then it cuts away.)     Since this was an unrated film, there was tons of room to make a truly erotic and extremely explicit sex scene. But what we get is something that isn't that much more than we see in most R rated erotic films. Any shots that showed below the waist sexual activity usually only lasted for a second or two. (The only scene that probably could have ruffled the ratings board's feathers was a brief sequence in which the sleazy teacher performs oral sex on Lily.) All of the participants are clearly not that comfortable with the material which makes the few sex scenes boring, laughable and about as far from erotic as you can get. I've seen R-rated films that were a ton more explicit than this.   Once again, my main beef with erotic thrillers is that if you know you're making an unrated film, just go all out and make it as sexually explicit as you can.  As can be expected, the sole reason most people will watch this movie is to see Alyssa Milano nude. While she looks great with her clothes off, it's clear that she wasn't all that comfortable in those scenes and she just looks flat out embarassed in the sex scenes. And to be honest, she's not naked all that much in the movie. When she is it's mostly just shots of her fabulous breasts (with a few moments of her toned bare butt), but unfortunately no full frontal. People would be better off just downloading the stills off of the internet instead of trying to make it through this piece of crap.   This direct-to-video dud is a thorough waste of time and really isn't worth watching for any reason whatsoever. For a film that advertises itself as soft-core porn, it is sorely lacking in the sex and nudity departments and features instead some of the worst scenes and acting around. Only Alyssa Milano addicts will find anything worth salvaging in this mess, everyone else should just act like this movie doesn't exist.   Poison Ivy 2: Lily is unrated and contains strong sexual content, nudity and language.   (as mentioned before the R-rated version is 2 minutes shorter and edits some of the more explicit sexual footage while also using some alternate camera angles. 
 The Summoning and The Seige were both enjoyable, but despite a decent first half, the last 200 or so pages of the sorcerer were more or less unreadable.  Shame, because this was otherwise a pretty good series 
 This book is not only inaccurate but it contains virtually some of the same text originally published in "Alfa Romeo Spiders" by David Owen in 1982. The similarity of certain passages is just too similar to be coincidence 
 Reading this book, I find that the author's ego interferes often with the documentation of how America went from Haute cuisine to the modern "American" restaurant.  One particular passage paints his mother (a cook) in the same light as Elizabeth David and M.F.K.Fisher, and leaves me wondering why, if she was so enlightened, do I not see her book on the shelf.  Throughout the book, he comes off as an average cook that could no longer take the heat, and left the kitchen to write.  With about 30 pages left to go, I cringe each time I reach for the book to attempt to finish it as what the author must perceive as colorful writing becomes more laborious with each page.  That said, there is definitely some interesting information, and if you can indeed labor through some of its issues, and weave around the author's bias, you will be somewhat rewarded.  (I especially found some of the La Pavillion information interesting after finishing Jacques Pepin's autobiography.)  Bottom line - if you are seriously interested in reading about American gastronomy, this might we worth a look if you can pick a copy up cheap.  I only wish someone with more skill had taken on the project, as it was, in fact, an excellent idea for a book 
 Total let-down. Hannibal Lecter doesn't even appear once. I really expected more from the interim novel between "Black Sunday" and "Red Dragon." There's none of the thrill or suspense that made Harris famous, instead it reads like a '70s pop psychology manual. Skip this one, read his later novels instead 
 I was looking forward to purchasing another Beth Orton album. Central Reservation and Pass In Time are marvelous. Imagine my dismay when I popped the CD into my lovely two-channel high end system to hear what amounts to MP3 quality sound. Simply awful. Move the production back to England. The people in New York obviously don't know what they're doing. 
 This book could have been so much better since the plot is really good. The writing here is a knockoff of Michael Crighton and really doesnt juve very well. I found myself skimming the pages after a while. The subject  of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again 
   This game is mindnumbingly hard not because its a very challenging but rather its set up to fail.Most missions thrust you into a situation with little indication of what to do. As the patients vital signs drops, you frantically poke at your DS trying to think on what to do. The nurse, who assists you, gives you vague ideas on how and before you know it you've failed the mission. It would take me an average of 10-15 failures before I finally won a mission. The last mission I played that made me quit, resulted in 30+ failures. And that's only being 1 hour and half into the game.   The graphics are crisp and clear. The storyline didn't make much of an impression on me. But I was probably too frustrated to pay attention to that. This game had a lot of potiental but killed it by constantly making you fail. Do not buy this game unless you have an extreme amount of patients, game collector who will keep it sealed, or you're a gultton for punishment. Whatever you do, do not buy this game for the hype. It does not live up to it.  
   I'd never heard of Gus Russo before spotting this book. Now that I've read the book, I know why I'd never heard of Gus Russo and why I will never again lower myself to reading anything he writes.    This book is simply bad. Russo apparently believes that every person of Jewish origins who came out of a certain Chicago neighborhood during a certain time and acheived any kind of financial success was somehow connected with organized crime. Russo's "Supermob," in fact, is almost entirely Jewish, although Russo defames many other people as well. Being Jewish myself, I find Russo's painting with such a broad brush to be offensive. Russo centers his story on the late Sidney Korshak, who was more than likely well connected with various criminal and political elements. Korshak, who died at age 88, was never indicted for any criminal activity of any kind, much less convicted of any crime. Thus, the noted lawyer/hotelier/industrialist Abe Pritzker, according to Russo, was connected with oranized crime because he borrowed money from sources that may have been controlled by possibly criminal elements. Talk about guilt by association to the 9th degree.    Russo is, charitably, sloppy when it comes to facts. Less charitably, there are so many clear and obvious misstatements, distortions and omissions of fact in this book that nothing Russo says can be taken at face value.    For example, one simple and egregious example appears on page 206. In one sentence, Russo refers to a Las Vegas hotel as having three-hundred rooms. Four sentences later, the same hotel at the same moment being described has five-hundred rooms. These kinds of inconsistencies and contradictions are found on almost every page - and, no, I am not exaggerating.    Russo is a political partisan of the worst kind, the kind with only a desire to destroy someone he doesn't like, without regard for facts. Ronald Reagan is a particular target for Russo's blind zealotry. Russo prints a claim by woman named Selene Walters that she was raped by Reagan, an allegation she did not make for 39 years after the alleged event. Russo accepts the unsupported claim as fact . . . along with many other allegations, all in an effort to blacken Reagan's name. It's really strange stuff.    On page 400 Russo talks about people in the entertainment industry - all Jewish, of course - who entered into "an unethical masterstroke that allowed the companies to avoid both U.S. antitrust laws and U.S. taxes." Russo doesn't explain how the arrangement, which was perfectly legal, was "unethical". But the participants were Jews, so in Russo's eyes, something must have been wrong. Russo further displays his ignorance by demonstrating that he doesn't understand the difference between tax avoidance, which is legal, and tax evasion, which is not. Russo, frankly, strikes me as just plain ignorant about a lot of things - but not the law of defamation.    Russo specializes in the scurillous, which explains why all of his subjects are dead. The living, defamed in this manner by Russo, would surely sue.    Russo ends his tub of nonsense by asserting his rectitude: "Their apologists assert that no proof can be found of Supermob lawbreaking. Pointedly, Sid Korshak was never convicted of so much as a parking violation. But the truth is Korshak and company constantly bent, folded, mutilated, and - yes - broke the law"    Well, if you had to depend on the "evidence" presented here by Russo, the countless libels against so many people, you'd have to conclude that indeed, many of Russo's dead and defenseless targets were much suspected, but never indicted or tried or convicted, of breaking any law. They were successful and they became rich - things Russo will probably never be able to claim for himself. And perhaps that's why he seems to hate these Jews so much.    Finally, Russo is a truly mediocre writer. His material is jumbled together, his words trip over themselves. He boasts of voluminous research and, like a child, put everything in this book. At 623 pages, a good editor could have cut at least a third, if not half, the pages with no loss. An honest editor, I think, wouldn't have touched the project.    Russo himself has quite a history. A Kennedy assination theory conspiracist, he is reviled in some quarters of that cult for changing his mind often. This book is on a par with much of the trash produced by such conspiracists. At one time, Russo also claimed to be a Pulitzer Price nominee. The Pulitzer Prize committee, however, had no record of such a nomination. Russo has since stopped making the claim.    Don't waste your money or your time on this dreadful nonsense.  Jerr 
 If Paleo people were so fit and healthy why do authors of this book put so much empahsis on importance of sports drinks? How about soda bicarbonate to improve one's performance, or caffeine? So where do we draw the line? Either promote NATURAL way of nourishing our bodies or lets have a list of supplements (as long as they are still legal) to give an athlete the edge. Too bad our ancestors did not have access to energy jels 
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 Why would the idiots at Universal Home Video release this cult classic in a pan and scan format rather than LTBX?  What a waste.  Now I have to return the DVD and stick with laser disc (1:85 LTBX) 
 I never received this item -- nor could I get a response from the company when I asked about it. My opinion -- RIP OFF 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
      If you are an intellectual idiot, you will love this book!  It waters down every important philosophical idea to the predjudicial opinions of one man who basically tries to use moral persuasion to "sell" his point of view but never backs up any of his "quotes" with footnotes of the "great philosphers" he is trying to "teach" us about!  NO DIRECT QUOTES!!  Yikes. Who can take this book seriously?       I don't think Plato would appreciate being watered-down in this way with neither footnotes to his brilliant, original work, nor any index. NO INDEX!!  Ask yourself this one question before wasting your money on this book:  "Why do I need a philosophy book written by an amateur who doesn't even consider me intelligent enough to make an index for me at the back of this book so I can look up topics as I want to?"  If, for example, you want to look up Plato, and what pages mentions his work in this "philosophy book" by Mr. Adler, you can't because there's no index.        As a classical homeschooler for the past nine years, I have to say I would NEVER ask my teenagers to read this book.  It's just not a serious enough philosophy book to waste their time with.  They are better off reading bits of Plato in the original than hearing the predjudicial opinions of Mr. Adler who's preaching, persuading, and glossing over details would make the money and time spent on it a total waste.  If you still want to read it, go to the library where it's free and decide then and there whether it's worth it.        It's simply unacceptable to have neither footnotes nor index in a book such as this 
 Take a close look at the sample recipes:  they are full of onion. Something entirely unsafe to feed your cat.  This is not possibly a vet-approved book 
 If you felt the quality really dropped off in the second half of the third season, you ain't seen nothing. The forth season shows a complete disregard to the elemements that made Sealab wonderful in it's prime.... it always had the veneer of cohesion that made it worthwhile. Season four is just stoner trash, and hey, speaking as a stoner........ it's bad s&*t man 
 A good story, but a terrible read. Page structuring is absolutely attrocious with each page written in a differently shaped stanza, as if the author thought this would make for more interesting reading, but my guess isattempting to portray the manic and angst that is the feel of the story in the paragraph structure. the result though, is a hard to read, hard to follow book that, if it had normal paragraph structuring, would probably only amount to 75 pages or so.  Save the stanzas for a poem. This could have been a really good book 
 Though I love Brother Cadfael, this story was most tedious and far-fetched.  I couldn't believe that this young woman would do what she did for a man she hardly knew, and the conclusion drags out too long and  elaborately, once you realize who she is.  I've read worse books, but after  the true excellence of most of the other Cadfael novels, this one was a  strange, sad let-down 
 I saw on the cover it said something about the New York Times bestseller list, so I kept reading (for a while) since I thought it must have something good in it to get on the list.  Well, it never did!  It's just a bunch of ridiculous long-winded drivel that couldn't get to the point.  The author dragged out the most boring unimportant acts for pages upon pages upon pages, and nothing ever happens.  The LONG descriptions are of something like Val whining ad nauseum how she doesn't want to go to this memorial service, or Jake acting crabby on the plane, or how Val sat around for hours looking at Tony's picture in her apartment, etc.  Anyway, I don't know how it got on the NY Times list, that's for sure 
 "Tribulation Force" picks up where "Left Behind" ended, and like that book, this one's slow. After the first one, I thought maybe things would start to happen in this one, but they don't. There are a few plot elements that are connected with endless filler. And none of the things that do happen in are completely devoid of suspense. There's one major event that we're told after the fact via a TV newscast. You might think that a book about the end of days would be interesting, but these authors obviously don't know how to write a thriller. It's just endless soap opera. This book and "Left Behind" should have been one volume. If all the books are the same pace, the whole series should have been a trilogy, but of course, then they would make less money.   Don't waste your time on it and don't encourage these talentless hacks by buying their books 
 This is a terrible book. It is poorly written and extremely predictable. If you are in High School it "might" be a good choice just to pass the time if you are bored to death 
 Most of these are re-renditions of the originals. Most people shopping for a CD like this would know right away upon hearing the samples that this CD is not what they're looking for.   Who has produced CDs with ALL ORIGINAL recordings?  This CD deserves zero stars.  OR, at least a disclaimer somewhere that these are not original pieces. 
 Toby is thirteen years old, living in a small Texas town in the middle of the Vietnam War.  His life is boring, he thinks, but this summer things are happening.  His best friend Cal's brother is fighting in Vietnam.  Toby's mother has gone to Nashville to enter a singing contest and left him alone with his father.  Toby is trying to win the attention of Scarlett, the girl of his dreams who happens to be dating someone else.  And then there's Zachary Beaver.  One hot summer day a trailer pulls into the parking lot of a local business.  A man gets out and announces that for two dollars apiece they can walk through and see the fattest boy in the world--fifteen-year-old Zachary Beaver.  When the man goes to find another act to join Zachary in traveling the country, Zachary is alone in his trailer.  Toby and Cal begin to visit him and become friends, realizing that he's more than just the fattest boy in the world.  This book was rather dull, I thought.  I found Toby's life and his experience completely forgettable, and even the addition of the fattest boy in the world didn't make his story any more interesting. 
 I have never had to struggle so hard to complete a book. The book starts off ok and heads straight to cardboard. Why the heck did I waste my money on this! Bitten, Broken and Stolen by Armstrong are so much better in kick-butt chicks with attitude, hunky werewolves, romance, and action/mystery. I do not make a habit of writting any reviews, much less a bad one but this book is so bad I have to warn someone. Save the money you would spend on this and buy Bitten instead 
 The book is about a spoiled unsatisfiable teenage girl whom keeps marrying men and then running away from her problems because she doesn't like her situation. I was forced to reed this book in school and i had no sympathy for the main character Janie. She needs to realize that the world is not perfect. The only part of the book that i actually cared for was at the begining of the book when she is gossiped about upon walking back to town and she ignores the gossip and holds her head high 
 I do not like these bags.  The twist tie closure system is cumbersome.  The bags are small.  The plastic is thin and leaks in the freezer when frozen.  The only advantage I can see to these bags is that they are easy to hook to the medella breast pump and pump into directly 
 I bought this recording with high hopes.  What better complement to reading Shakespeare than hearing him, right?  Well, not with this recording.  The cast is made up of "distinguished actors," the insert proclaims, but it's obvious that these actors haven't done Shakespeare since they were in junior high school.  Nor have they improved since then: none of the actors has any feel for the Shakespearean line.  The speaking is stiff and mechanical, and half the time it sounds like a Monty Python farce!  When there are no visual effects to distract us, low-quality acting really sticks out.  For audio recordings, you need the best voices.  Too bad Arkangel didn't realize this.  My advice?  Grind up these CDs and use them to fertilize your nasturtiums 
 I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I.  Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship.  And the writing isn't so hot, either.  If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad.  The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 Some good information but the book tries to cover too much and hence, doesn't do anything exceptionally well. Too few communities covered. Too much tourist and moving info covered. I can get restaurant info from better sources and I don't need tips on Pros and Cons of having a roommate. I was hoping to learn more about demographics of surrounding communities but only a few were covered and not in much depth 
 Perhaps Dr. Mercola has some valuable insights; however, this book is way too convoluted in its writing. Who wants to trudge through the verbiage to get at the significant kernels? In addition, it is clear that anyone who cuts out grains and sugars is likely going to end up cutting out calories in the deal - that is probably the basic truth of this eating plan. The rest is hype-like. Are you willing to devote an immense portion of your time to food planning and preparation in pursuit of the demands of this diet? Just think, time you don't spend in the kitchen or in the grocery line is time you could be spending out exercising. When he writes, somewhere in the middle of the book, that if you are following the diet religiously and still not losing weight, then you should consider limiting your calories to 1000 per day. OKAY! What just happened here?  We've been switched to a low-calorie diet, only without grains! So, if you have a weight problem that just doesn't like to budge and a metabolism that just drags you through life, you may end up on the 1000 calorie diet plan, where you've been many times before. So try it, but save wasting your precious $$$$ on the book. It goes like this:  no grains, no sugars, no simple starches (potatoes, carrots, etc.), certain fruits only, most vegetables unless very starchy, meats, fish and poultry - preferably organic, butter, cream and cheese (all within reason, I suppose):  you'll need to read the book if you want more detail, certain good oils and no bad oils, almond butter sometimes, walnuts sometime, etc. Hey folks, it really is just plain old horse sense, you know this stuff anyway!! 
 Don't know why my first note hasn't appeared, so I'll briefly restate. the claim-to-fame of this film is it's avant-garde, push-the-envelope sexuality. Amazon describes this film as "Unrated", but that's not what nearly all of these listings are selling. These are the new "R" Rated version that is MASSIVELY redacted. In fact, all of what makes this film famous has been reduced to some brief nudity. Even though the box continues to bill it as "The sexiest movie ever made." On top of that, despite an English only cover, my VHS purchase was subtitled in SPANISH. The seller has offered an adjustment. He didn't know. But Amazon needs to drop the 'Unrated' description, as that implies the original. Those still interested might look for something like a 'director's cut'. I still haven't found one. Sorry if this is a duplicate of previous post 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 Jeez, maybe I am getting old, but I really found absolutely nothing about this film to be interesting or original in the slightest.    A brilliant scientist.  Disfigured.  Angry.  Finds temporary techie fix for face.  Goes to get bad guys.  Fighting.  More fighting.  Still more fighting.  Ex mate learns he's alive.  He leaves her anyway (he's too ugly).  The end.  More to come, if successful.  Not recommended 
 Cold Mountain is an unfortunate novel.  It is unfortunate it won the National Book award (why did it win?).  The novel has an unfortunate structure; Fraser simply strings along one incident after another, with little connecting thread.  The weight of flashbacks alone drags the novel to the ground (and it hardly gets off the ground in the first place!)  There are glaring anachronisms.  It is difficult to believe that some of the sentiments he puts in his characters mouths could have been uttered in 1864.  This is a forgivable sin, if the novel is well written, if it rises about the banal, if it offers something more than surface.  But this novel is all surfaces and all banality.  Its publication is indicative of some of the pathology of today's publishing world (this will be a BIG novel, this will become a BIGGER film, which will sell more of this BIG novel).  Too bad for us the novel does not justify the claims of its promoters.  Fraser's eight million dollar advance for his next work is probably a clarion signal of another BIG novel to come 
 Someone gave me this book and told me how thrilling it was. Halfway through, I find myself still reading it mostly to laugh at the horrible writing and melodromatic style. It's a little depressing to think that millions of readers have made this guy rich and famous on such awful writing. It's good for me to pick up a book like this now and then to be reminded that by avoiding the most popular authors, I'm not missing much. 
 The book started out really well, but then became very self-congratulatory.  The author includes about 40 photographs of herself in an array of different outfits.  While I admire her success, a bit less self-adulation would have made this a far better read.  
 Smitten by the possibility of having old English craftsmanship preparing my toast after several years of disposable toasters, I ponied up 75 bucks for this baby. When my dog sees this toaster come out, she waits patiently to race me for the slice before it hits the floor.  Results are not much better than a 20 buck Chinese piece of junk.  Fair to good toasting of many bread & English muffin types.  If this toaster lasts, maybe the launching mechanism will wear down a bit after a few years and work properly.  
 Sure this book is only for beginner or outsider of Cosulting business. But then, for the price of this book, I would rather buy a much cheaper book but with more useful information and ideas - such as Consulting for Dummies. The book is full of motherhood statements and it is more liked written by a grand mom and she called herself consultant; But come on, Consulting is a highly skillful business that require structural, systematic yet creative thinking. Overall, I think this book is a waste of money for experienced consultant. While for beginner, the reader will risk the wrong impression that it's this easy to win a consulting work - highly unlikely in a complex and competative world 
 use less than 3 times, the touch screen doesn't work.don't know why~ 
 Since the reviews about broken wires were both written well over 1-2 years ago, I thought surely the problem had been corrected.  Why would a company continue to sell a broken product?  Well, apparently this company is perfectly fine doing just that!  Like previous posters, the wire on my board arrived broken. There is no damage to the packing, so it is not a shipping issue.  I ordered this product for a Superbowl party in a few days.  Obviously I cannot use it.  I haven't been able to find a number, just an address, so I can't even complain about it today.  DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!  Amazon...wake up and quit allowing your customers to buy this item.  It reflects poorly on you 
 For me, as an old Superman reader, i found the movie story very hard to "believe". The picture shooting and the special effect of it is master piece, wish Richard Donner has this same techonolgy in 1978. Why the story is so weak? First, it is not logical for Superman to leave earth suddenly without telling anybody specially Lois (And specially if their relation went to making love this time). Second, the reason of this disappearing, and what a reason, he knew from sciencetes that his planet, Krypton, MIGHT no be explode and there are some survivors, well, Superman doesn't need Earth People to tell him about his Planet, he could use his telescopic vision to check that and not to go there and check, under the red sun radiations. And if we presume that he went for this reason, why it took him 4 years to come back? ,....... no answer. Third, Clark Kent was absance too, for the same period like Superman, is it normal for Lois not to doubt in this matter, we all know she is the all time person who always think that Clark Kent is Superman, but now she even doesn't care of saying hello to him? ??? Fourth, why he need Space Ship to come back to earth? We all know that under the Yellow Sun, he gain all his power back. More and more, i can't believe when he can carrie a whole island of Kryptonite all this distance from earth to space, while he usually can't breath if he was under the radiation of the Green Kryptonite.  Well, this story suits children who are new to Superman. I think they should contact people like Alan Moore and Cary Bates next time if they want to make Superman Movie.    
 That's basically my two cents. Shallow characters, bizarre story. I am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films, but I do like a good story and heard this was one. It was not. All of the characters were inverted - Ada and her daughter were utterly irritating, George was disgusting from start to finish, and Sam Neill's character (supposedly the heartless jerk) was actually the easiest to sympathize with. How frustrating!  On a positive note, Michael Nyman's score is unbelievable. I love it 
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 This book is probably useful for learning what missionaries are up to out there in the non-Christian world.  However, it does not stop to ask whether they SHOULD be out there.  And of course, from a cross-cultural and anthropological point of view, they should not.  It is arrogant, ethnocentric, and culturally destructive to spread a culturally-relative and almost certainly false ideology and belief system where it is not needed or wanted.  Missionaries have been the source of much of the world's trouble, and they still are.  But more essentially, the whole idea of missionazation is judgmental and intolerant. Why do those people need you and your "belief"?  How would you like it if they were missionizing you!  Oh, but you think your religion is true!  Well, so do they!  It seems all missionaries and those they missionize have in common is a lack of cultural understanding.  If we recognized religion as the relative (different in different places, not "true" in any meaningful way) and damaging, irrational thing it is, we would stop supporting it and start supporting real efforts that help people in real ways 
 I love Bentley Little - ordinarily - but this short story stinks!  Not too much more can be said about it.  Boy meets dead dad in closed mall, dead dad wants boy to kill mom, boy doesn't kill mom, that's about it.  Save your money on the 'real' novels, and if you haven't read it, start with 'The Ignored' for a book that is worth the money 
 My greatest problem with this book was it's appearence of blaming America for the woes of Japan and excusing excesses in time of war.  The author gave me the impression that he was more willing to forgive Japanese excesses in battle while condeming America for it's methods to end the war.  I grant the author's expertise in the access to a personal source for the battle of Iwo Jima near by but I cannot accept his rationalization of Japanese atrocities as a cost of war then condem the Americans for their bombing the enemy homeland (fire and nuclear) to destroy their will and ability to wage war.  Overall the book is well written and provides an insight to the mentality of the Japanese military during the war. 
 The book explained the concepts of the subject well enough, but the number of typos in the problems and in the answer key led to many hours of frustration. I was often under the impression I was doing something wrong, only to find out the givens in a problem had incorrect prefixes, or some other error 
 This is a fantastic book for those people who are slowly losing their grip on reality. While some of the basic underlying concepts are good I don't find myself practically applying the concept of psychic prisons to my organisation, nor do I view my staff as ameobas that make up a large organism. I have to admit though that I know of others who found the paradyme of organisations as instruments of domination highly arousing 
 When i read about "the unit" for the first time i was excited and couldn't wait to see the first episodes, but now im not sure that it was such a good idea to buy it. Its a bit too unrealistic to be realy good.  The Characters are not authentic enough to really play there parts in the show. My comment, a bit to much fantasy and rah-rah patriotism for my taste. Not worth the money in my opinion.  
 Bought the isqueez along with the Brookstone Protection Plan on Feb 13, 2007 and it nearly crushed my foot on April 24th, 2007 and then it totally stopped working (just makes a grinding noise).  Called the toll free number for the Protection Plan and they said the item is still under manufacter's warranty and that I'll have to call Osim.  Called Osim's toll free number and they said I'll have to pay packing & shipping to return it for replacement.  Very unfair in my opinion as they should send a pre-paid UPS or FedEx label for return of their defective product.  Called the Brookstone store at Lenox Square in Atlanta where I bought it and the manager said to call Brookstone's toll free customer care line.  Called the customer care line and Kelly there told me Osim and Brookstone are one- and the same company.  She said it is their policy to have the customer pay for return shipping for defective products.  I will never buy from Brookstone again.  Their Protection Plan is a sham, their products are defective, and they don't care about their customers 
 This book offers no real practical advice for reader to "survive" in crazy and dysfunctional workplace. Furthermore, the writing of this book is way too PHD-alike to tie to its "light-hearted" title. I stopped reading it after 20 pages or less 
 Good, flattering fit.  I'm 5'2" and I bought a short which was perfect and long enough to wear with heels, even a bit long actually.  Unfortunately when I washed them, they shrank 2" and now I have to wear them with flats.  I would buy them again, just in a longer length 
 This book was so slow and boring that I stopped reading it after a few chapters. The characters were hollow, their actions inexplicable. In addition, the suspense was zero. I am appalled that so may readers give this book four or five stars 
 This product does not massage at all......just vibrates.  I have it under my desk at work and RARELY use it.  Very disappointing 
 This book was recomended to me by a naturopath. It was easy enough to read in just one evening. The sections about how bones grow and what your risk factors are for getting osteoporosis were quite good. There is also good advice about what vitamins and minerals in addition to calcium to include in your diet, as well as the importance of vitamin D and sunshine, for calcium absorbtion. However, the food section is confusing. Nelson does not mention sea vegetables as the best food source of calcium and minerals to include in a healthy diet. And since she has the opinion that a person can get all the calcium they need from food sources, she should have included a more accurate calcium food chart in her book. For example, spinach, which tops the vegetable calcium secton, contains a lot of oxalic acid which interfers with calcium absorbtion. Nelson mentions the oxalic acid problem with some foods, but never mentions exactly which foods contain the highest amounts. Instead she says we should eat these foods for other reasons. So, why is spinach at the top of the calcium chart? Let's have a more accurate chart before telling people they can just add up what they are taking in with the chart she provides. Also, in her section on exercises she encourages women over 50 to jump vertically to retain calcium. A woman should gradually build up to 2 full minutes of jumping. What if a persons knees are not in alignment? Jumping is one of the most jarring and hardest things a person can do to their knee joints, especially if they are heavy on their feet. A woman who is over 50 and not used to exercising could easily get injured with this jumping program. I am over 50, and I already exercise 5 or 6 days a week, doing aerobics, running and weight training. I tried jumping vertically at a fitness center in front of a mirror to make sure I did it correctly. Then I went on to do a leg press, which I do on a regular basis, and my left knee hurt. My personal trainer said running would be much better for me than jumping. I do not have joint problems, yet, but I could after Neilson's exercise program. Also, the medication section encourages every woman to consider hormone replacement therapy. Does we all really need this therapy? I am discouraged that this book was rated so highly and recomended. It was mostly a waste of money. Only the first couple sections in the book were really worth reading. Check it out at the library or buy it used if you must 
 Before I started reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.  Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In "Zen" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s. But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.  The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17:      "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower."  That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of "quality."   I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.   Whatever the book was supposed to be, it didn't impressed me.  
 This is a very poor product.  It stayed on for about the first day and then fell off.  We re-attached it and it would only stay on for a couple of minutes.  It is also supposed to automatically reposition itself over the lid when you close the lid and that design feature never worked.  Don't buy it, it's worthless 
 This was a cute product, but only lasted a day.  Perhaps my preschool boys' punches were just too much for this bag.  A patch was included, but it seems that air is leaking from the seams.  Oh well. 
 The back cover advertises live performances of several songs. What you get is an hour-long interview "set against" a few seconds of songs here and there. I don't recommend this, even for die-hard fans. The interview footage is just slapped together and isn't particularly interesting or informative. Spend a few extra dolllars and pick up their concert DVD or video compilation 
 Although the setting and factors involved appear to be intriguing they just come off as "boring".  The characters are stale and PLEASE the endless details of the streets, roads, mountainside - NOT necessary.  I'm truly disappointed because up to this point I have had nothing but the highest praise for Daniel Silva's works.  But, like someone else pointed out in another review - something happens when an author writes about the same characters over and over.  I believe Mr. Silva has gotten just about all he can out of Gabriel Allon, et al - and I was disappointed when I discovered that although he had thought to put an end to the character Gabriel Allon in his latest book he was advised by some friends NOT to.  Too bad - I know I won't buy that one.  I LOVE to read and "consume" a book in a relatively short time period given my busy schedule.  Yet, I've been "trudging" through this one for weeks - not days 
 honestly people, this is like making fun of Barney. Who cares? I winced when I added Kidz Bop 4 to my shopping cart but that is what my nephew wants for Christmas (...not MY kids and NOT in MY house ! ). I would rather have bought him KidzBop Gold, at least he could have learned the words to The 59th Street Bridge Song and Here Comes the Sun instead of Complicated or My Boo, some of the songs they have to censor but the subject matter is the same and its just wrong... Did they make kids' versions of Stones and Zeppelin songs? ...that would have been cute...or Romeo Void or Van Halen? kiddy porn. But anyway I think KIdzBop Gold is the best one, if you can call it that.. 
 This is NOT a book for non-physicists.  I have a doctorate in Dentistry and began reading the book, thinking it would become less obtuse.  Ten pages later, I resorted to flipping each page in the hope that I would find something that made sense to a "layman"...no such luck. It could have been written in a medieval Persian language and I would have learned as much from it.   
 We selected this book for our discussion group this month.  And I started reading it several days ago.  The first half of the book went slowly; it was confusing and uninteresting.  The second half picked up with some tension and interest.  And the ending just triumphed with sadness and melancholy feelings.  I watched the Patriot/Broncos game while reading the story.  And the storyline followed the game 
 I am a huge fan of Linda Howard's books. I have purchased each and every one of them. I live in Israel so getting her books in English from the U.S.A. isn't cheap Cover of Night was the most disappointing book of Linda Howard's I have ever read. It was boring and I foung myself turning the pages and looking for something interesting to read in that particular book. I hope the next one is more interesting. I will keep looking forward to her books since I have enjoyed and re-read many of the ones I have 
 Book is out of date with modern economic thought.  Essentially restates classical economics and provides little in the way of acceptance of the need for balance between government and the markets. 
 I first read Parker Palmer's spiritual guide The Courage to Teach as an undergraduate student, some number of years ago. At the time Palmer received much praise for his truthful ways of helping steer teachers through their inner emotions and was already well known for his numerous previous works, including the infamous To Know as We Are Known. Genuinely interested in the hype surrounding Palmer's passion for teaching and unique means of connecting with the hearts of teachers, I read his latest book and found that it took a great deal of courage to follow. While it is clearly evident that Palmer is a highly respected teacher and writer, I found the initial chapters difficult to comprehend, intricately florid like an artistic poem, rambling, and long-winded. At the time, I was not yet a teacher, and attributed my boredom with the book as such that I was an outsider to the realm of teaching and lacked basic classroom experiences upon which to identify with the voice of the text. In 2002 I walked away from the book, half finished, with a single passage ringing continuously on my mind: "Teach in the space where the community of truth is practiced".   Four years later I have found the courage to reread Palmer's "...exploration through the inner landscape of a teacher's mind", and with daring audacity seek to unravel the weave that is Palmer's complex web of connections by developing my own scholastic, communal space where truth can be practiced.   I will admit Palmer's ideology is more comprehendible to me the second time around, though I suspect like many great works The Courage to Teach gets better with age and familiarity through experience that can be connected with the text. In summarizing my two experiences with Palmer, "Teach in the space where the community of truth is practiced" is still my synopsis of the bulk of his book. Now, if only one can comprehend the meaning of this passage and apply it to their daily work, Palmer has succeeded.   If Palmer had included with his book, a sketch explaining the flow of his chapters, I would have been a much more contented reader. This being said, it is obvious I am a visual learner, and Palmer would have appreciated my awareness of boxing myself into such an "either-or" psychological learning style, though he'd recommend I read his book in its entirety and create an outline of the text, if I so find it essential to my learning. Therefore in an effort to truly appreciate Palmer's wisdom, I dredged through the intrapersonal, verbal intuitions of the text while spatially outlining his premises for heartfelt teaching, which I feel he almost certainly could have summed up in a fraction of the space.   According to Palmer, the heart of a good teacher does not exist in technique, but rather in their identification and ability to share their own identity and integrity with their students and colleagues. Palmer suggests that good teachers teach from within; they are able to connect the subject they teach with their own lives, therefore "(weaving)...the fabric that joins them with their students and subjects...their heart is the loom". As straightforward as this reads, we are fearful of wearing our heart on our sleeve, opening up and sharing the very genetic makeup of our lives because a risk is involved. Teachers and students alike, risk "failing, of not understanding, or being drawn to issues they would rather avoid, of having their ignorance exposed, (and) looking foolish in front of their peers". As a result of this fearfulness we become silenced and withdrawn from discussion, much like a student on their first day at a new school, only the silence sticks with us, from walking into the classroom and being unable to find a communal place from which teaching or learning can successfully come. Palmer extensively references Barbara McClintock, the 1983 Nobel Prize Winner, whose vital discoveries in the field of genetic organisms were recognized in part due to her understanding that all living matter is dependent upon a communal factor.   Palmer continues throughout the entity of the book describing the "Parker" space for practicing the community of truth. The safe community Palmer established over 30 years of teaching requires that six ground rules are abided by:   1. The space should be both restricted, and open  2. The space should be hospitable and charged  3. The space should invite the voices of individuals and the group  4. The space should honor both the little stories and the big  5. The space should support solitude and community  6. The space should welcome silence and speech   By virtue of the fact that we are all humans, and therefore members of a common society, and given the truth that humans naturally turn towards community, learning in such an environment should give the impression of feasibility. However, we cannot insist upon closeness within the parameters of such a community, thereby requiring yet another truth. Palmer suggests that the best learning environments are those in which the "subject (is at) the center of our attention". Although Palmer makes it clear that engaging students in the community of truth does not require that we put the chairs in a circle and have a conversation, I reflect upon the courses I have taken it which a low student enrollment made this such classroom arrangement possible. It was easy for me to recall such classes, the years and seasons in which the courses were taught, the professors' names and the names of my classmates, the subject matter and the dialog linking the books we studied; all appear clear in my mind. To the contrary I can scarcely recall the foundations of my classes in which the aim of the course was to deliver a great deal of information through nonstop lecturing, leaving the very subject so distant from the expert that the amateurs (also known as students)  could only baffle at the flood of knowledge we were supposedly receiving.   Palmer then comments that "we pay a high price for (the) privatization..." we receive once becoming teachers. It is no astonishment that when teachers become so isolated from one another it becomes only natural to teach in a similar manner, withdrawn from the subject and monotone as if speaking to oneself. If we pledge to grow as teachers, we must invite people to share in our process and listen to our soul fair and honestly. Lastly, Palmer provides empathy for any teacher who has ever had an awful day and questions the very reason they ever decided to join the ranks of education. Palmer reminds us that education is always "more a process than product" and students often don't learn to appreciate their professors until sometime later.   Palmer asks his readers to reexamine not only their methods to teaching, but their lives as well. As lifelong learners each of us is a "knower" encircling the subjects we put at the heart of our attention, but as teachers, we must cooperatively create the communal space where learning can occur, all the while acquiring the competence to connect with our students through sharing our innermost identities. In addition, we must not try to duplicate the teaching styles of our mentors, but rather investigate and improve upon the teacher within ourselves. The Courage to Teach offers readers a glimpse at the possibilities that exist when we are able to regain heart. Easier said than done, Palmer's spiritual guide challenges its readers and is undoubtedly a noteworthy edition to any teacher's library, but don't expect any life-altering changes to occur from reading the book.   
 This 2002 copyright book I bought (thought I was getting most recent version) is not a good book. Dont buy it. Way too much fluff.   PDF File on CD didnt work at first. Eventually got it to work, but shouldn't an adobe file work wihtout having to contact tech support 
 This book is, in hindsight, horribly wrong. It is now known that there are no WMD's in Iraq. Saddam did not pose a threat to America and the world at-large. It's just sad that the trumpeters of the Iraqi war were playing to the wrong song. It's packed with faulty and "highly dubious" intelligence. The CIA has since admitted as much but I do not expect as much from a hack writting a book to profit from a "massive intelligence failure" 
 This machine is an accident waiting to happen. In order to pull out the (very hot) toasting rack, you have to attach a separate handle. Not only is this awkward and inconvenient, we found after many attempts to attach the handle safely, we were unable to do so, since it attaches at an angle that requires on's hand to come very near to or actually touch the EXTREMELY HOT frame of the oven. Avoid this item at all costs 
 No true CW MCCALL fan should stoop to buying any collection that would omit the classic singer/songwtiter/rapper's most seminal work!  Looks like I'll have to pass on this one and be satisfied with CW McCall's Greatest hits.  What a disappointment 
 I saw on the cover it said something about the New York Times bestseller list, so I kept reading (for a while) since I thought it must have something good in it to get on the list.  Well, it never did!  It's just a bunch of ridiculous long-winded drivel that couldn't get to the point.  The author dragged out the most boring unimportant acts for pages upon pages upon pages, and nothing ever happens.  The LONG descriptions are of something like Val whining ad nauseum how she doesn't want to go to this memorial service, or Jake acting crabby on the plane, or how Val sat around for hours looking at Tony's picture in her apartment, etc.  Anyway, I don't know how it got on the NY Times list, that's for sure 
 This book was absolutely REVOLTING. Not only does the hero kidnap the heroine and makes her family and fiance believe she is dead, he also rapes the heroine out of necessity so she couldn't go back to said fiance! As if this wasn't enough, he forces her to sleep with him naked, and repeatedly forces her to have sex with him until she gets used to it and starts to like it. This is nauseating as it is, but then he beats her because she disobeyed his orders. I don't care if he did it as the ship's captain, her lover (read rapist), or whatever. This is a romance novel and heroines are not supposed to be beaten, especially not by the heroes. You would think things would get better after this, but..ohhh no! She gets abducted by four men and you know what's coming next. Nevertheless, you keep thinking the hero will come to the rescue at the last second. WRONG. She gets brutally gangbang raped while one of the hero's servants is present. Not only that, she was pregnant and loses her baby when this happens, AND her skin gets ripped open (yes, THAT skin). If this scene was meant as a contrast to the first rape by the hero to show that his actions weren't really that awful, in my opinion, it is very unsuccessful. It doesn't matter how the hero raped her, if he thought he loved her or not. Countless men think they love someone. It doesn't mean they can force themselves on those people. At this point, I was ready to throw the book away, but I thought it could only improve (after all, it couldn't get worse), so I kept on reading. I suppose I wanted a happier ending. And you would think the book is near it's end, but you would be mistaken. This is only halfway through. She finds some letters and gets mad at her captor so she escapes to her fiance and has sex with him, only to realize that... oh! She is in love with her dear rapist! At which point the hero comes to recapture her. As if this wasn't bad enough, the ending of the book is completely unsatisfactory and hastily written. I cannot bring myself to understand how this is the author's favorite book! She probably has rape fantasies and is into torture. Same goes for those who liked this book. Even if people do attach themselves to their abusers in reality, I do not want to read about this in a romance novel. And I certainly don't want graphic descriptions if a gang rape! There is not ONE thing I would recommend from this book. Unless you're a masochist or a sadist, STAY AWAY 
 I didn't even have very high expectations.  After reading this I thought that people should leave well enough alone.  You cannot possible match up to Jane Austen.  The book was very disappointing.  The characters were annoying, I didn't like how colonel fitzwilliam was portrayed at all.  I would have thought he would be more agreeable. The daughters of Darcy and Elizabeth were not very engaging.  It is a quick read however.  It lacked character development and I don't feel I got to know all the sisters.  it read like a regency romance novel.  There was not natural wit to the writing.  Wow. . .I was pretty harsh.  I guess you should read it as a romance novel but not as a sequel to Jane Austen 
 This book is so appalling that I honestly do not understand why a publisher would put out something like this.  It is almost 300 pages of what looks like a power point presentation.  There is hardly a complete sentence in the entire book- just bullet points.  As a reader I am disgusted at this format and hope that this is not a sign of things to come. I simply could not "read" this book.  The presentation is terrible. There are no proper sentences, no paragraphs and therefore little in the way of intelligent analysis.  Not being illiterate I hated it because its message was impossible to decipher. Who knows what it is about -   I wish I could give it zero stars. 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
  What a mess of the royal proportions - such a great cast (Peter Sellers, David Niven, Orson Welles, Woody Allen, Ursula Andress, Deborah Kerr, and Jean-Paul Belmondo), the James Bond's story, plenty of beautiful (and I mean it) girls, the music by Burt Bacharach, most famous sets - but the movie is almost totally unwatchable. It started funny enough - at Sir James Bond's (David Niven) home where he was approached by four international agents that forced him to come out of retirement and head up the operation against the evil organization SMERSH. His mission is to destroy Topple LeChiffre (Orson Welles} at the baccarat tables where he never loses and wins a lot of money to supply SMERSH. Then, the movie becomes silly, stupid, pointless, and (what is the worst) not funny. Only Woody Allen, (as Bond's incompetent nephew, Jimmy Bond) brilliant as usual has appeared in two scenes and made them silly and hilarious. I think that "Casino Royale" (the way it was made) illustrates the fact that bigger is not always better - overlong and overblown, written and directed by five or more writers and directors, it brings to mind an old saying, "Too many cooks spoil the broth".  OT: the abbreviation SMERSH really existed during the WWII. It means "Death to the Spies" in Russian.   
 I found the book to be extremely wordy.  As I read the book, I found myself having to remind myself what the chapter (or topic) was suppose to be covering.  Many of the statements in the book are common sense and points are repeated over and over through-out the text. The books is loaded with long list consisting of from 4-12 items.  The list appear to be attempts by the authors to include every possible idea they could think of.  My Professor used the questions from the test bank and many of the answers were buried in the readings.   	The cases studies were interesting, and the information on the website helps with the case analysis.  Although after reading one of the chapters, any reading was interesting.  Reading this book became a chore.  If the book is required for class, start reading now because the way the book is written will make you procrastinate 
 Altho the 747 was a mouthful... it left a bad taste in my mouth.  I needed a light read... too bad the oxygen masks did not operate... maybe some literary talent could have been breathed into this book.  
 Robert Allen's previous book, Multiple Streams of Income, is EXCELLENT and I can't say enough good things about it.  This one was a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT in comparison.  He talks about the same rehashed Internet marketing strategies that everyone else does.  Creating email lists, newsletters, blah, blah, blah...  The most disappointing thing about Robert Allen -- and I lost so much respect for him over this -- is that he demonstrates how to get a bunch of people to order his product within minutes of putting out an email blast.  What's stupid about the whole thing, and demonstrates that he's a snakeoil salesman scam artist, is that what he's selling by email is a course on how to make money on the Internet...so how do you make money on the Internet?  According to Robert Allen, by selling courses showing people how to make money on the Internet is the only way to make money on the Internet.  That's a scam!  How does he sleep at night?  Don't buy this book.  It's a waste of money 
 Between the amended "politically correct" ending to this famous tale and the so-very-hokey interaction between Kirstey Alley and Lloyd Bridges, I couldn't wait for this to be over! The animation was very poor quality... the music was not the focus, my grandchildren lost interest. Shat else could possibly have been wrong 
 Most people that follow the great works of Penn Jillette & his partner Teller already know his overly excessive opinions on religion.  In Sock, he drives home his opinion from the very beginning and painfully continues to dredge it back up over and over until you are finally grateful that the book is finished and (hopefully) you won't have to ingest it again.  Oh sure, I could have just put the book down, but being a fan of Mr. Jillette & Teller's other works, I insisted on finishing it.  Did I feel that I made a mistake?  I ended up feeling like I had to sit through a long whining session from the one employee at work that no one likes, but you feel just sorry enough for him to patiently allow him yammer on.  We know Penn-- you hate organized religion and believe that it is all hooey.  That is your opinion-- good luck with it.  He should also realize that the majority of the Earth believes in things beyond mortality and at the very least they shouldn't have their noses dragged through profane drivel that would only sicken them.  I'm not a religious person, but I couldn't help but cringe when he remarked about having intercourse with the holes in Jesus' hands. Mr. Jillette launched so many diatribes against religion, you sometimes forgot what the book was about in the first place.  If you saw their B.S. episode on the bible, you would get the same déjà vu feeling as watching Ace Ventura movies and remembering Jim Carrey on TV's Living Color.  The book itself is centered on a murder mystery narrated by the central character's toy monkey, made from a sock.  Great idea, but poorly executed.  P&T's magic shows do not center themselves around profanity, but their B.S. show certainly does.  I like the premise that they attempt to expose lies that many people take for truth.  It seems, unfortunately that each show becomes cruder both in content and language.  Mr. Jillette's book Sock, appears to have morphed from Penn's over-arching disgust for religion and the popular, profanity-filled B.S. show.  Looking for swearwords?  Sock has it in spades.  Obviously, there is nothing wrong with profanity in literature, but when it becomes excessive and intended to shock the audience, it becomes sophomoric.  Crude references to women, homosexuals and everything in between tends to become exhausting, and would probably only appeal to young men who are anxious to shed their goody-two shoes exteriors and impress colleagues in the locker room.  Many of the paragraphs end in excerpts of music from the 50's to the 80's.  I don't know if it was to imply that the Monkey loved music and typically referenced it as he narrated, but eventually it became tiresome.  I get the feeling that the purpose of this book was to introduce the reader to Penn Jillette's views on religion, homosexuals and his music collection.  The basis of the story would have been amazing had James Ellroy done the writing.  Crime stories are meant to thrill the reader, not mire them in distaste.  If you are interested in crime mysteries, stay clear of this book.  If you enjoyed watching Linda Blair blurt out profanities against religious icons in The Exorcist, then this book is exactly for you.  No wonder Mr. Jillette likes to use "Captain Howdy" in some of his other material.  I was given this book for Christmas (actually the original owner couldn't make it past chapter 2).  I don't know what to do with it, but I certainly won't donate it to the local library.  I won't sell it on Ebay since the guilt I would harbor would haunt me for years.  Perhaps I'll give it to the employee that no one likes.. 
 I have been a big fan of this series and really enjoyed last year's compilation edited by Theroux.  I also must admit that I really enjoy Theroux's travel writing as well.  This year's edition, edited by Mayes, has the same faults that her books do, namely, they are long on description and short on plot.  I have not gotten all of the way through The Best American Travel Writing of 2002 yet but what I have read is very similar to Mayes' "Under the Tuscan Sun".  If you really like tales of flowery, descriptive (and dull) walks though Italian streets, etc. you will probably enjoy this book but if you are looking for more "great adventures" travel stories, try the 2001 edition instead 
 Nothing is clear in this book, it is not organized and not well writing. Filled with charts that are dispersed wherever and not easy to understand.  Frankly it is an advertising of the Investor Business Daily, IBD, please subscribe and you will make money, I lost my respect to Mr. O'Neils when he ended the book by the testimonials from Investors. He even wrote if you deal with a broker who didn't attend his class!! It is a worst investor. 
 The book pretty much presents itself the opposite of what it claims to be about. How can you just expect teenagers to avoid the dangers if you don't allow them to be well educated about it. Remember the "Just say no" program that was supposed to bring down drug addiction? Well, telling teenagers simply not to do it only encouraged more of the same and it's certainly no different when it comes to sex. No wonder the Bible belt has higher cases of teen pregnancy for following Dobson's pathetic advice whereas the West coast and the Northeast have far lower numbers and percentages of teen pregnancy by providing sex education to students. If you're going to read this book, be warned that the author is just another rightwing special interest hack 
 I was forced to read this drivel for a graduate photo program. God I wanted to kill myself and quit photography by the time I was finished with it. If you want to read great photographic essays try Bill Jay's work. Amazing, insightful and filled with a sense of humor 
 What an unfortunate film this is. Not just unfortunate because it's bad (which it is), but because it has the potential to be pretty good.  The idea behind the film is really intriguing, and could make for a great film. Here's how the Possible Films website describes it: "Hartley's newest digital feature invites us to consider a world where citizens are actually proud to be stock options whose market value goes up or down depending on their sexual activity. A world where having sex just because it feels good is against the law. A world where one's credit rating determines everything."  Doesn't that sound good? At least, potentially? Too bad it doesn't live up to that promise.  I mean, yeah, that's what the movie is about. But it's done in such a poor way that it just betrays the whole concept. It's hard to name what makes it such a bad movie, but it's something that persists throughout the film, not just any particular part. For starters, there's the omnipresent narration (always a bad sign), which gets repetitive fast and really doesn't add much to the story. Which is a little ironic, because I'm sure the story would be almost incomprehensible without it. Blame that part on the script, which is laden with cardboard characters, inconsistent plotting and clunky dialogue. Of course, bad dialogue can sometimes be saved by good actors...too bad there weren't any in evidence here. The actors who did show up universally delivered their lines with a leaden clumsiness that might even make a soap opera fan wince a little.  And then there's the filming style, which was trumped up so much in post-production that the style was a complete distraction from the substance of the film -- probably because there wasn't much substance there to be had. Jerky stop-and-go motion, interspersed with still frames, nonsensical transitions from color to black and white and back again...it's all there, the clear signs of a director who didn't have the vision to make a movie in the camera, and tried to save it in the digital editing suite. Suffice it to say, it didn't work.  I watched "The Girl from Monday" all the way through, because I kept hoping that there was something there that would salvage this really interesting idea from the land of bad movies. There almost was. About halfway through, one character receives a sentence for a crime she has committed: "Two years hard time...teaching high school." My wife and I had a good laugh; that was a genuinely funny, clever, and unexpected moment. Then the filmmakers had to go and ruin even that by explaining the sentence with more of that droning narration.  This is a movie that is more than the sum of its parts. Good idea plus bad writing plus bad acting plus bad directing equals a really, really, REALLY bad movie, the kind of movie you might expect to see late at night on a basic cable station...and even then, it'd probably be a bit disappointing 
 As a Classics grad student, I have to say I do not recognize the Classics departments he describes in this book. The Classics scholars I know (and I've met many of them; it's a small field) are dedicated fair-minded scholars, not 'careerists.'   Furthermore, Classics was one of the first areas of the humanities to acknowledge the debt the West owes to the East (back before it was fashionable) and if Hanson thinks the venerated M.L West was some dippy postmodernist, he'll have to go through me.  Finally, Classicists have never gone wholesale for the New Historicism/cultural relativism that has paralyzed, say, academic English departments. The whole academic world needs to be dipped for these ticks, but Classics less than most.    I think Hanson is endorsing the same antique parody of the Classics field that our multicultural critics use against us: tweedy, irrelevant conservative white supremacists. Classics has not been like this since the days of Basil Gildersleeve. Classical scholars of the 20th century have achieved the difficult feat of balancing progressive ideas with sober scepticism, and they deserve some kudos for it.  Let's let Victor Hanson go duke it out with Martin Bernal, and let the rest of us go back to teaching, writing and keeping the flame alive 
 So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin.   There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural,  mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong.  
 Oh, please, this book is just ridiculous and trite.  Here we have Olympia, the "perfect" modern woman, beautiful, a successful, high powered lawyer, who has the perfect job, gets to take every Friday off even (don't we all?), a perfect and wealthy husband who loves her dearly (but of course), two gorgeous twin teen-age daughters, one a "rebel" interested in protesting everything, the other a social butterfly (would you expect anything else?), a mother in law from heaven (An Auschwitz survivor - to bring a little pathos into the story) who she loves better than her own (dead) mother, (what other kind of mother in law could she be?) and a young, perfect son (naturally).  Oh, did I leave anyone out?  Let's see - she has her requisite ex-husband who naturally is an alcoholic and a complete jerk (hmm, nothing new there), with his silly new wife (well, did you expect her to be anything else?) , her one black friend (yes, keeping the story "real"), and oh yes, the real point of the "coming out" - not her beautiful twin daughter's coming out ball, but her eldest son admitting to her that he is gay, at the ball, of course, while she gazes up at him proudly with tears in her eyes.  (let's bring the storyline right into today's headlines).  The book was so filled with cliches it was pathetic.  From the husband taking a stand against going to the ball because it was against everything he believes in (while he is, naturally, fighting for the poor and downtrodden in his high powered legal job), to the ex-alcholic husband "playing the ponies" and living on his trust fund (has not worked in 15 years), to one of the twins getting a tattoo, which just almost destroys Olympia because the tattoo will show when the twin wears her dress to the ball, oh, but, handy survivor grandma to the rescue, who manages to sew a perfect stole by hand in one afternoon, after Olympia dashes around and naturally is able to find the material in the exact shade, weight and hue as the dress.    Of course this coming out ball is supposed to be for "WASP" society only, so the husband makes a stand by refusing to come to the ball.  Olympia  decides to make her own stand, by inviting her black friend and her husband, as well as her Auschwitz survivor mother in law, to the ball.  In the days before the ball, the youngest son gets chicken pox, the mother in law falls down and breaks her ankle, one of the twins boyfriends breaks up with her, one of the twins loses a glove (chewed up by a friend's dog) and Olivia has to run out to buy a pair of manolo blahnik heels for her daughter.  Oh, yes, and the twin's escort shows up to the ball with electric blue hair.  But, because Olympia is perfect, she manages to "fix" everything at the last minute . .  did you expect anything less?  This book was just awful, and did not ring true at all.  Each character was a cliche in themselves, way over the top.  The premise of the story was ridiculous. . .  I have read most of Danielle Steele's work, ok, so she is not Dostoyevsky, but her books were good for sitting down on a long afternoon with a nice cup of tea and reading a juicy and interesting story.  This short book seemed like it was almost written because she had contractual obligations to fulfill.  There was no passion, the sentences were short and stilted, and she seemed totally disinterested in her characters.  Come on Danielle Steele, you can and have done a lot better than this!!!  Don't bother with this book.  When I finished reading it I literally groaned, it was that bad 
 I made the mistake in buying this book. I thought it was about Filipino Martial Arts....it's about how a supposedly avid practitioner of the FMA keeps refering to Japanese and Indonesian arts trying to lump everything and anything under FMA.  It's really sad because these so called 10th degree grandmasters let these guys crap all over Filipino Martial Arts and get away with it.  It's not Japanese or Indonesian..it's Filipino....The author wrote a book with nothing but his own opinion...he probably never been to the Philippines.       Sorry but Sarongs and Kerambits are not Filipino...Guys need a reality check.  Stop bastardizing the art!  I'm sorry I bought this book and I'm sad that this is how some Filipinos are teaching the art just to make everybody happy and to fatten their wallets 
 Well it looks like my question regarding why these two "Classic Cartoon Favorites" DVD's are being released in September has been answered! Anywhey being honest, I do own one DVD of this series and that is called "Starring Chip N Dale" that is because there has never been a Chip and Dale collection on DVD before so i own it despite the bad resterration on all of the cartoons 
 The reference to craft "superstars" should have warned me off. The lowly T-shirt shows up as a placemat, a lampshade, a car-lot hanging banner, cafï¿½ curtains, and a rug - oh yeah, and a couple of overworked wearables, too. Tricky projects show off the wit of their too-cool creators rather than enrich the lives of DIY readers.Who needs it? 
 Perhaps the most outlandish and misguided book ever published on the  subject. Despite an appealing premise,  the writer fails to deliver  anything resembling a guide for a successful marriage.  In its place, we  get ultra-conservative hogwash that will surely doom any couple to an  unhappy marriage. Indeed, no self-respecting woman will tolerate a husband  who accepts Andelin's advice. Written by a dentist, the book recommends a  course of action that will prove more painful than a visit to his dental  office.  This book would make a hilarious read if it were not meant to  influence naive young men. Get "Letters to Philip" by Charlie  Shedd, or anything else on the subject, instead 
 I was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did. There is no plot, the characters described very poorly and the writing is definitely unimpressive (I would not mind the writing so much if the plot was there). Throughout the whole book all the main character does is answers the phone and gets coffee ... how exciting is that?   
 I think there are more helpful books out there.  I think Lucinda Basset gains her "expertise" from claiming to have had panic and anxiety problems in the past.  While I don't discount the power of receiving help from someone who has been there, I question the seriousness of her anxiety and question her "expertise".  I see it more of a money making kind of agenda.  The book was repetative and obvious and while the tips are mildly helpful and true, not sure it would be what someone with full blown panic and anxiety disorders would need.  Maybe helpful for someone with mild anxiety or difficulty adjusting to a life change. 
 I was ready to like this book. I wanted to like this book. I'm interested in this particular era and the author has a fine reputation for the historical novel. So I began reading with great anticipation - only to discover deep disappointment. I haven't read his other works but he really strikes out with this one.  The idea is an interesting one - intertwine the story of Marconi, the inventor of wireless telegraphy with a famous murder case in which the wireless figures prominently.  The problem is the author seems to have lost all his understanding of dramtic writing - character development (there is none), tension (there is none, we know the outcome before the book starts), Plot (plodding), Pacing (the author gives away the wireless tie-in during the first chapter, so there is no mystery at all - no dramatic announcements by the keen and stalwart detective at the last moment to surprise and delight the reader).  These historic, naturally dramatic events are presented as if we were reading a dreadfully boring history book. And there is no dialogue at all! We only hear from the characters when the author dryly quotes from their letters. Rather then letting the characters speak for themselves and tell their own story, the author lectures us on all that happens. Historically more accurate perhaps but it makes for dull and dreary reading.  The murderer, Dr. Hawley Crippen, is so shockingly inept that one wonders  how the man was able to tie his own shoes. He is so stupid that he can not devise of a simple cover story to explain his wife's disappearance (like she ran off with another man, for example) He allows his girl friend to wear his wife's easily identifiable jewelry and furs - right in his own office! Does he imagine no one will notice? He even sends his flunky out to buy several suits of boy's clothing - all but telegraphing his intent to flee with his girlfriend disguised as a boy.  When its not being a dry-as-dust history book, this tome is like reading a stuffy newspaper article in the Times of London. A nasty twit killed his wife and was caught (yawn).  I gave the book two stars rather then one because at least the parts about Marconi and his struggles to perfect and commercialize his invention are somewhat interesting.  I would recommend it only if you are waiting in the dentist's office and there was absolutely nothing else to read (and you found it sitting there).   In summary: a depressingly dull and boring book. Don't waste your hard earned money on this one 
 This is an "experiment" alright... A failed experiment? This is a phenomenal singer with a phenomenal voice. His first CD was the best.  Ok, "experiment" is over! JOSH, it's time for you break out of this downhill track and use your incredible talent on really beautiful songs! I and, I'm sure a lot of your fans, wouldn't even mind if the songs were not original. Just sing them and, because Josh Groban is singing them, they will become original. Show the world how beautiful a song can be, when Josh sings it. Thank you for your wonderful work so far 
 Sure the acting and the direction are adequate (Robson Green is a charismatic screen presence) -- certainly a cut above most American TV crime fare.  Alas, the story lines in this series are so contrived and improbable that they completely dispell the illusion of close-to-the-bone realism this show tries to project. I watched 3 installments of this series and each time I was struck by the lack of authenticity in the characters, their motivations, actions (and reactions)-- beneath the "gritty" veneer, these characters are paper-thin and implausible (particularly the criminals). Creeghan's tendancy to vigilantism is disturbing, yet fails to convince (I mean the guy's a walking liability, a loose cannon obviously in need of psych-leave) The whole production emits a subtle, yet palpable air of manipulation, sensationalism & pretense.  Want to see a truly gritty -- and thoroughly human -- British crime series? Watch "Prime Suspect" and skip these 
 One of the many problems with this book is the order in which the topics are presented.  Right off the bat, They decide to put linear equations ahead of all other types of DE's.  Are they really as simple to solve as seperable equations?  The entire second chapter is a complete mess and is very disorganized.  The forumla for the integrating factor of linear equations is difficult to ascertain, and it is never clearly stated (it's there, but their notation is convoluted).  I don't want to sound like someone who is just having difficulty with the math taking it out on the innocent textbook.    I have consulted other textbooks on the topic, and I have to say that I really like Zill's DE's for the logical way in which it is organized, and    Kohler and Johnson's text for its clear explanations.  My professor actually commented on how bad this book is.  All DE textbooks are NOT created equally, and if you are struggling through this one, try finding older editions of those other two from your University's library.    
 The literature of September 11 is never attacked.  When a book speaks of September 11 (or of terrorism in general), it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy.  Jonathan Safran Foer's EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE banks on such sympathy, on such reverence.  The narrative, which concerns a nine-year-old boy named Oskar Schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father (a narrative stolen, in its basic outline, from Guenther Grass's DIE BLECHTROMMEL), could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions.  Nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel: the others include Hiroshima / Nagasaki, the Staten Island Ferry crash, and the Dresden bombings.  Each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity, but historical "trauma" itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation.  Oskar, the insufferable brat, attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father, Thomas Schell, Jr., a victim of September 11, by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds, the collage of images and letters which is the book we are "reading"---an almanac which, most likely, is written sometime in the indefinite future (Thomas Shell, Sr.'s manuscript of 4/12/78 is heavily edited (pp. 208-216).  Who has done the editing?  Almost certainly an older version of his grandson Oskar).  If the term, "reading" even applies.  Whenever a "pregnant" image is described, Foer literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image.  When a flock of birds rises into the sky, it is not enough that we read of these birds---we must see them as well.  Words may not be left in their invisibility; we are presented with supplementary photographs, illustrations, since mere verbality is not enough.  (Indeed, the entire novel oozes with misologos --- the mistrust or hatred of language --- in terms of both its content and its form.)  Photographs, yes, and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages.  Space is not used in the manner it is in the works of Edmond Jabes, for instance.  Typography does not substitute for a well-wrought sentence.  Foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities --- most specifically, the responsibility to write well.  Why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal?  As far as the writing is concerned, it is composed of nothing other than mind-numbingly, soul-deadeningly repetitive phrases ("heavy boots," "raison d'etre," etc.) and Sunday school platitudes: "Sometimes one simply wants to disappear" (184); "There's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself" (184); "Everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are like skyscrapers" (245); "How can you say I love you to someone you love?...  It's always necessary" (314).  Whenever the author writes something that he finds "beautiful" and "true" (165), he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is "beautiful" and "true."  The entire book reeks of such unearned profundity.  We also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus---a very deep truth indeed, one that Foer also communicates in his essay, "Emptiness" (originally published in PLAYBOY) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel, a Sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians (Ringo Star) and scientists (Stephen Hawking) are unthreateningly approachable: everything is familiarized.  Perhaps it is wrong to criticize Foer for including so many blank pages in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, since the entire book is a vacuum: null space into which readers may project their own meanings.

 This book can be summed up quote from page 70 of the text: "long on talk and short on results." I was very disappointed with the investment of any money in this hyped book. The authors ramble on and on and give little but their long winded examples of what they think the third wave is. My advice is to read the introduction and don't waste your time with the rest of the book. 
 I am definitely an admirer of Bobbi Brown, whose lovely makeup designs can actually be worn by real women in real life.  Her book "Bobbi Brown Beauty" is one of my favorites.  However, much of the advice in that book is repeated in this one.  There are new features in this book; for instance, a section on makeup for cancer patients and sections on makeup to wear for each decade of your life.  However, about seventy percent of the advice in this book was dealt with in the previous publication.  I would only purchase this book at a bargain price 
 This album is nothing more than a catalogue of all of the synthpop/futurepop dreck that has been masking itself as goth and industrial music since the late 1990's. Having heard these bands played in clubs I can honestly say that I couldn't tell one from another. Why? Because ALL of them sound exactly the same.They have the same exact beats and same exact angst driven lyrics. I can see why some teens would like them, but if you are above the age of 30,like I am,they will most likely annoy you and make you want to bang your head against a wall.  To those of you who have been calling this music goth please think again. In the 1980's there was a clear distinction between synthpop(Depeche Mode,Book Of Love,etc...) and goth(Christian Death,Sisters Of Mercy). Please don't confuse the two, because they are not the same.  
 This book has a better description than what it has for its contents. If you are a neophyte at this topic then perhaps you will use can use this book. It assumes its reader is completely unaware of why job analyses must be done and unaware of what does not work. It can be safe to assume that buyers of the book are in the business of job analysis and want to know the latest techniques of job analysis. The last 3 are worth reading but having to purchase the book is,on the whole, a waste of your money. 
 When I saw this in the library, I guess I was expecting another version of The Nanny Diaries, which was cute. This "novel," however, was poorly written and jumped all over the place; there were no smooth transitions at all. It was basically one big promo of her company--any time she mentioned a "horror story" she was quick to add that it wasn't one of HER nannies. Basically, I thought it was boring and that the writing style emulated that of the 3rd graders I teach. It took me about an hour to read, after which I thought, "How did THAT get published?" If you want to read a nanny book, try the Nanny Diaries. This book is stupid. 
 Then why bother?  This is terrible for the true Prince fan, Warner needs to come out with a better DVD compilation...  Truly disappointing 
 This movie is an utter crap fest! I remember watching this film as a kid. Back then it was a scarry experience, watching it now is just plain mind numbing. This movie is beyond bad, and while some campy films can be quite entertaining, this is definitelly not one of those movies. Horrible acting, laughable demon makeups, zero excitement for horror fans. Don't waste your money on this crap, rent it before you consider buying it. 
 Having enjoyed other Ripley stories, I found all the cental characters in the book unlikeley, and discriptions of Ripley and his relationships irritating and was glad to finish the book, by skimming the pages towards the finish.  
 If you want to read a Classic of Western Mythology, look no further.  This is specious philosophy under the guise of a supposed 'truth' about reality.  The tragedy of all this is noticing other reviewers' comments about how the contents of this book negatively influenced their lives.  Dawkins belief that we are machines created by our genes is a misleading view of reality, and when evolutionary 'science' catches up with evolutionary 'philosophy,' this view will come out false.  This could only be taken seriously by those who are so blinded by the details that they can no longer think straight, so they are not able to figure out where the argument is wrong, let alone realize something IS wrong with it.  What almost everyone doesn't seem to understand, even about VALID arguments is this: ALL a valid argument does is set up a tug of war between the premises being true and the conclusion being false.  If the conclusion is OUTRAGEOUS, you don't, "bite the bullet," "swallow the medicine," and accept the conclusion anyway.  You say there MUST be something wrong with the premises, even if you can't point out where the mistake is.  It took some 2,000 years before someone came up with a solution to why Zeno's argument that 'nothing moves' is incorrect.  But during that period of time, NO ONE (except maybe a few fools here and there- probably 'intellectuals' like this Dawkins character) accepted the conclusion that nothing moves 
 This picture had some good potential but the director tried too hard hard to make it some kind of arthouse flick. A rather pointless attempt to remake Brewster's Millions with an altuistic slant. It wasn't a "bad" movie it simply wasn't a "good" one. Boooooooring...zzzz..zzzz..zzz 
 This movie disappointed me greatly.  The script was dark and emphasized the worst in mankind.  The opening scene lingered for ever over a drunken, hopeless crew. The plot had no redeeming value but emphasized idolatry of every type known to man:  love of self, pride, indulgence, love of pleasure and gratification.  The script seemed to go out of its way to include unnatural acts or depravity and wickedness that most likely never occurred aboard any military vessel in WWII for discipline would have to have been totally forsaken.  The movie is dark and hopeless.  The ending in muddled and confused. The time invested in watching it was a waste.   
 I love Tamia but this cd was a disappointment, I like maybe 2 tracks from the entire cd 
 Instead of talking about what you can do to help your husband make more money, why not let him help you make more money and he can stay home with the kids?  Help him triple his income and then run off with a leggy-blonde leaving you jobless and responsible for those kids.  That's a great idea 
 The information in this book is worse than incomplete. The practice questions in the book and on the CD are nothing like those on the EXAM. There are many practice questions that are poorly worded, and have WRONG answers. There are also many questions with TYPO's. Example there was a question comparing DIMMS and RIMMS, but all the the answers referenced SIMMS. Stay away from this please!!!!  Jokes are not funny and if this book was written by an 30 year + IT professional... well frankly that is sad. He should have had to knowledge and resources to create a book that is accruately geared toward the exam. Like other for dummy books, this book was probably written by underpaid, barely expierenced kids, with a limited review process as to maximize publisher profits.  If you are taking this exam I suggest that you obtain study materials from Testking or Realexams. Stay away from this book, it will not help you pass. The information it concentrates on such as DMA/IRQ/BIOS settings/codes etc., can be found for free on the internet.  In retrospect, I would buy this book only if they didn't charge me, and shipped it for free. At least I have a coaster for my drinks at work 
 The radio dials are not accessible when the radio is in the case -- I cut slits in the case with a knife to be able to tune the station and volume when in the case; I can't believe the case didn't come this way -- and that's just the start of the problems. The dials are fussy and it's not easy to carry this radio, even in the case, without nudging the dial to the point you must remove it from the case -- if you haven't cut any slits in it -- and re-tune your station.  In Minneapolis-St. Paul, WCCO AM radio comes in fine in a suburb 15 miles from downtown. But that station has howitzer power. Forget about tuning in virtually any other AM station in the city. Granted, I didn't buy this to listen to FM or shortwave. It was to be an inexpensive radio to listen to baseball. With the Minnesota Twins having moved from WCCO, that won't happen, as this radio is incapable of pulling in the Twins' new AM radio home, or any othe AM signal in the area. That's really difficult to imagine, being other radios I own -- even chintzy giveaway promotional radios -- can pull in most any station in the metro area.  If this is an example of Grundig's work, I'd say they rely more on their brand name than their products.   
 Dr. George Gurganus was professor of missions at ACU. ACU is a Liberal Arts university which is supported by the Churches of Christ. The Churches of Christ were a sectarian breakoff of the original Disciples of Christ movement started by Alexander Campbell and Barton W. Stone, and other significant leaders. This was a movement to both unify and restore New Testament Christianity.  In 1898, the Church of Christ broke off as a sectarian movement, and this break became official in 1906. This sect later became a cult which believed it was the only true church on that faith of the earth. All other believers in Jesus Christ outside of this circle were not saved.  George Gurganus preached for a while with the Churches of Christ, and obtained his doctorate. He was somewhat a voice of moderation among the more hardcore Church of Christ, but remained a believer, practitioner and leader in this cult called the Churches of Christ. Later he went with the International Churches of Christ (Boston Church of Christ), as their main missions leader. Even the mainline Churches of Christ considered this new group of ICOC a cult. It was just a matter of one cult calling another church (from their own heritage) a cult.  As a former student of Dr. Gurganus, he was an excellent teacher, but harbored no dissent. His writings apply to the Churches of Christ, which still considers itself "The Lord's Church". 
 I got this movie because James Darren was in it.  He was good as was France Nguyen. They play the only likeable characters in the main cast and neither makes it through the whole movie.  Of course I knew that when I bought it.  
 It is my belief that people who really know what they are talking about can explain their thoughts clearly. I cannot be sure if the fault in this book is with the original author or the translator, but it certainly does not measure up to this criterion. It may be of interest to photography academics, but I doubt if a photographer will get much out of it that is useful 
 I was stunned when I started reading the Introduction and found a misspelled interjection - an eye-popping `viol' right in the first paragraph of the book! I felt so offended to be presented with such a sloppy mistake in - what is supposed to be - the most critical hook for the reader that the next thing I did was ... voil ... return the book and get my money back 
 Community Playhouse in Long Beach did the show this August. As it played, the plot didn't come through, but the wit of Shaw did. The playhouse didn't have the costumes of the military men, nor the actors to carry-off the pomp and bravado of these would-be heroes. In a time when G.W. Bush is fighting his own phantasmic enemies this play should have lapooned the whole spectre of military madness. George Bernard Shaw gave us the theme it will take some imagination and talent to make it contemporary and equal to the madness of our times. Ano 
 Clive Cussler made his reputation writing books with plots that are barely believable using characters that are totally unbelievable saving the world over and over again from his perch in an unknown but extremely powerful U.S. government agency. After many successful books, Clive perfected the formula and is now sharing it with Paul Kemprecos who co-writes an analogous series which uses the same agency, plots, and characters. Oh, this series does change some things, the main character is Kurt not Dirk and his sidekick is Mexican and not Italian. Also, there is a second pack of characters (Paul and Gamay Trout) who allow the plot to develop through a second set of eyes.  None of which takes away from the formulaic tone of this series and this book in particular. In typical fashion, the first chapter is a historical look that "sets the stage." In this case it is an aerial combat over the Alps in 1914 between an industrialist and six (6!!) combat pilots. Needless to say, the industrialist holds his own and manages to down four of his foes before he himself is shot down and killed. The next chapter comes to the present time and takes off a second thread - this time it is a "survivor"-type of reality show which is interrupted by an attack of some mutated beings. The third chapter starts pulling all these disparate threads together and off we go.  Unfortunately, this book is too formulaic. It does not take the reader long to realize who the threat is, nor does it take us long to see the connections between the various threads. The only real complication is a completely preposterous connection between the bad guy's attempt to take over the world and an infestation of some new kind of sea weed that tries to take over the oceans.  As is usual in these novels, there are high speed car chases, underwater action, aerial acrobatics (in world war 1 vintage planes no less!), underwater escapades and explosion galore. throughout them all, the hero gets a bit bruised but the thugs all manage to get killed (Even though they are supposedly highly trained special forces types) and the world is rescued by the effort of one man - Kurt Austin. There is a love interest (why a different one in each book? Doesn't he ever get to enjoy some time with his rescued conquest?) who is French, and side visits to Scotland and Massachusetts.  The only unique thing about this book was that it was the first time that I was exposed to the "Premium" format which is a slightly longer/taller book with more space between the lines. The book cover states that this format is "Specially designed for comfortable reading" but I cannot say that it improved things for me that much.  To summarize, as a Clive Cussler fan, I had to read this book to make sure I keep up with the adventures, but this one is not in the top two-thirds of his efforts. I am sure that Kurt Austin will reappear soon and hope that the next one will be more interesting and fun to read 
 I should have listened to Yael's review... dead on.  Nothing special about this book.  I'll be donating it to the library 
 I ordered this book along with the book In Search of Sisterhood on Tuesday and lets face it Amazon you really delivered, as I had both books by Friday and had completed reading The Divine Nine that same night. I am disappointed because I had hoped to learn more than the book delivered. I found more information by Googling each organization than what I found in this book. The author appears to have just bundled up generic known information and published it in a book with a few cheesy interviews from a few known members. Now it is time to reread In Search of Sisterhood because I have read this book once and I loved it so much that I had to have my own copy 
    This story was seriously depressing, and was in no way a book that I would call enjoyable. 
 Not a very entertaining or informative book.  Also, a lot of the information is outdated 
 On the basis of the ideas contained in the book, it probably deserves 5 stars.  PC set theory is still the dominant framework for teaching both undergraduates and graduates how to conceptualize and analyse atonal music.  However, I have to give the book 2 stars simply because writing is so awful.  Forte's prose is so and unwieldy that I sometimes read the book to help myself fall asleep at night 
 I agree with the reviews that consider this book a pretentious, self-indulgent, ego-fest. Wallace is obviously highly intelligent, and every minute of this book seems designed to remind us of that.   It all starts off well enough. The characters are quirky and interesting. At first. And Wallace does a good enough job of setting up a curious chain of events to keep the reader reading and wondering what's going to happen. But nothing ever really happens. And at some point I just grew sick of the characters and their weird little lives.   Ultimately, this just felt like what happens when a really smart person decides to write something as a way to experiment with and exhibit his own intellect. And while that exercise may have been rewarding for Wallace, it wasn't so terribly rewarding for the reader.  
 Having recently graduated with a BA in English, I am forever doomed to read such so-called "truth texts" with what could only be called an eye for detail; does the author site her sources?  Credentials?  Any sort of solid evidence as to why I, as her reader, should believe a word of what she says? The answer is, simply, no. Ms. Cumbey quotes other texts by other zealotous fundamentalists, to be sure.  However, the credentials of these people remain a mystery.  Anyone can write a book, and anyone with enough money can get it published.  Had I the funds, I could write a "revealing, riveting best seller" on the nature of human genomes and cloning and my opinions of the matter; throw in a few quotes by people who may or may not sound like they know what they're talking about, and there you go.  The point is, my knowledge of such topics is sorely limited, as is Ms. Cumbey's research.  Yet somehow a book that would never earn a passing grade in a collegiate literature course for lack of research and depth of understanding is littering our shelves.  Well, I'm baffled 
 I am so sorry I couldn't rate Mary Emmerling's new book higher. I'm a huge fan of her style and wit. I collect her books and even keep all my copies of her first magazine and current Country Home magazine. So, maybe my expectations were a bit high for this book. I found the pictures beautiful enough but the text was just lacking any sort of authenticity. My favorite book is her previous "Romantic Country." It seemed to reflect her personality and warmth. "The Art of the Cross" just seems like mail-order catalog reading. Hopefully, she'll have a new and improved book out soon 
  I enjoyed the Forward to the book. The, albeit, brief reference to 'elegance' being a package - the importance of a great walk and pleasant voice being a given. After the 'Forward' I found the book progressively downhill. Sure, there was the usual worthwhile guidance - the quintessential little black dress, simplicity- less is more and choose quality over quantity - but hardly groundbreaking for anyone with more than a cursory knowledge of fashion. Much of the text stressed silly, outdated and/or erroneous rules- don't wear black in the morning, don't wear bright coloured shoes except in the evening, choose neutral handbags in black and brown (much prefer Kimora's ideas in 'Fabulosity' she suggests choosing handbags in cherry, emerald or orange -let's face it, way more colorful and interesting), women over 21 look better in one piece swimsuits-(surely this is a matter of abdominal firmness- a 40 year old can look stunning in a bikini an overweight 16yr old not so). It went on to refer to Queen Elizabeth as a style icon. As I read the book, I kept seeing glimpses of a girlfriend. She's 40, well groomed, always wears expensive quality clothes but frankly it's all deathly dull - there is no individuality, no surprise in her dress, seems aging- it fits her partner is decades older.  'A Guide To Elegance' focuses on rigidity in fashion (heavy on do's and dont's)which has hopefully been surpassed by CREATIVITY. Interesting, youthful dressing is pleasing at any age and gives vibrancy and youth- my brother in law's mum,70 wore a colorful folk skirt and matching bright shoes to Christmas lunch and looked wonderful. Many readers have commented on compliments when implementing the book but when you give thought and time to your wardrobe, coordinating pieces and ensuring all is clean and fresh, shoes polished etc, hair and make up well done, a great walk and smile and then... irrespective of any supposed 'fashion' book you will indeed be stunning and elegant.            
 Wow. Unlike most people I wasn't that worried about CN taking  a hand of the second Big 0 series. The fact that they were likely doing it for money didn't worry me in the least. I knew they would do their best to deliver a quality work and continue on with the spirit of Big O. If you liked the first season but are denying yourself the second, you are making a big mistake. Don't let Kid's review scare you away either. That is neither proven nor acknowledged as a theory for the series. It is just one possible interpatation. To set those of you that have fears at rest, I will deliver a counter-example. For everything the Kid said there is a counter example that makes the events of Paragdrim real and the ones in the first episode as false. These are spoilers for the first episode, but please read it! Especially if you read Kid's review... it is a counter to that.   SPOILERS:   1. When Roger speaks into his watch to call Big O there is nothing on his wrist but a leather band and a broken watch. (A Kid)  Counter: Yes. That is because as we speak Roger is losing faith in himself and thus Big 0 won't allow him to be his pilot. The missing watch isnt insanity. It is Freudian psychology. As a side note, the reason the fake world Roger invented looked like our world is for a variety of reasons. One of them is so that the audience can associate with it more. Another reason is so that we think Roger is insane. Roger thinks he is insane, and the makers want us to think he is too. Later, Roger realizes he isn't insane. He was just afraid! He admits that fear and then gains back his confidence. The audience then moves on and enjoys the real world of the anime. "A Kid" decided to not do that and instead set about ignoring the sequence of events, and also making giant assumptions out of absolutely nothing. For example KID: Where does the insane asylum mentioned in 5. come from? There is no reference to it either abstractly or directly in the anime! You made up the asylum, and even admitted it yourself. The asylum forms a large part of your reasoning and without it the flaws in your theory are already becoming clear. I just hope that makes watching Big 0 for the second or third time more enjoyable for you A Kid (:   2. The REAL Beck, the Bank manager, who Roger fantasizes as a criminal, points out that "this man is obviously dilusional." (A Kid)  Counter: Beck appears in the Big 0 manga. Everyone keep that in mind for the rest of what I say. Now, in the anime Roger is reading the manga. In the first episode of the second season, Roger runs into Beck. He knows who Beck is. Got that so far? Good. Later, after meeting Beck, he reads the manga that Beck is a villian in. Now how is it that a "real" bank manager appears in the manga that supposedly inspires Roger Smith with the idea of making up a pretend world? Did the bank manager give the manga makers permission to use his character for whatever reason for a vilian inside the manga? I know that is hard to understand, but read it through two or three times and it should become clear. It is already proof that A Kid was wrong in his sequence of events, as in, what happened first and what happened next.   3. Roger reads from the Big O Manga and gets the idea for his fantasy about being a negotiator and piloting Big O. (A Kid)  RIGHTTTTTTT *sarcasm*. Have you read the Big 0 manga A Kid? If Roger Smith as the Wanderer based a fake world off of the manga, then why is it that so many people in the Wanderer's World appear in the manga before he even reads it? Roger was reading about people he had met in the Wanderers World. For example, he met Beck in a bank, called him on being a criminal, and was called delusional for his trouble. He then LATER, after meeting the bank manager Beck, reads a manga that YOU (A Kid) use as evidence that says that Beck is a criminal, thus confirming what he already knew. Roger is disheartened by this because he sees it as proof that his world does not exist (which it does). A bit like this:   Wanderer Roger: Oh. It is a manga. I can use this to make my own fantasy world! (WRONG!)  Negotiator Roger: NO! It is a manga! That must mean that I really am insane! (RIGHT! BUT NOT REALLY, CAUSE HE IS RIGHT AND THE MANGA IS WRONG. It is just what Roger thinks).   Want another example? Roger calls out Dorothy's name as the human Dorothy walks into the Nightengale, but Dorothy appears in the manga that Roger reads afterwards. How can Roger be living in a real world with a manga inspired off people that exist in his world?   4. By the time Angel comes to pick him up in the car Roger has already returned to his fantasy world and nothing that occurs from that point on is real anymore for the rest of the series (I think). (A Kid)  You think wrong. You don't think on a psychodynamic level do you? Roger is being driven by conscious and unconscious forces, okay? Get that through your head, it is crucial. Roger is losing confidence in himself and unconscious forces within himself are helping him do just that. LOSING CONFIDENCE. At the same time, we, the audience, are supposed to lose confidence with him. The next step is admitting that we were wrong and that Roger is sane. You just decided not to do that. Again, you just jumped around filling in holes and making the "crazy" theory where there was none.   5. Roger sees himself driving the car while he is in the back seat, a halucination that has been known to have been played out by schitzos. (A Kid)  This is basically the first thing you said that has any bearing whatsoever. It isn't enough though. While what you said about schitzos is true, it isn't enough to condemn Roger as one. Rather, Roger was trying to make himself (and by extension, us) think that he was schitzo. A person losing faith in themselves does what their intuition tells them. Try to lose it faster! That was what Roger did. Eventually, he had to face the facts. Roger the Negotiator was real, Big 0 was real, and he needed to master his fear and move on and embrace the uncertain future.   A Kid - A Kid, your problem was that you put way too much stock inside one episode. After that you mixed around the sequence of events. You make it sound like Roger read the manga and then met everybody inside it. That isn't impossible. A Kid, you need to pay more attention to the other episodes! Especially the last one.   Roger talks about how Memory helps people find out who they are.  At the end, Roger starts remembering who he is by examing his past. At the end of the series, Roger claims he doesn't know exactly who he is. He starts Remembering everything from start to finish because he wants to get a bearing on that. That is the end of Big 0! He is using Memory to help find out who he is now compared to what he was then. His experiences (with Dorothy and Angel) have changed him a lot. Notice that the fact that he is insane doesn't even enter his head once. He got over it. You should too.   Roger the Wandederer is the fake. Roger the Negotiator is real. Roger has a lapse, that lapse made him think he was insane and he lost confidence. That was when he was Wandering. He later realized (thanks to memories of the real Android Dorothy, for whom he feels affection) that The Negotiator was real and the Wandederer was just the guy who was afraid.   A Kid. The chances of you reading this a year later are tough. Still, I got to press you. You seem smart. Watch the series again and look out for the things I said. Namely the first episode. As for everyone else. Take what I have said to heart or at least to thought.   A Kid's Theory about Roger being crazy: It has no ground. A Kid messed up the order of events in the first episode, ignored the rest of the series, and then made a whole bunch of assumptions that have no factual proof whatsoever. There is no asylum, there is no Wanderer. That was Roger losing faith. He regained the faith in himself and remembered he was the Negotiator. Read everything I said again if you are still confused. It is important that you understand.  A Kid makes you think the first episode is the only real episode. That is wrong. It is the fake episode, and that episode that is a review! Come on everyone! Think! The first episode of the second season is just a review on everything that happened in the first season of the anime! You have little retake episodes like that in every anime series you watch! Think! THe Big O crew wasn't satisifed with just making a recap epsisode though. They made it like it was so that they could mess with our heads. A Kid took a small ball, ran with it, and tried to make it into something it is not. He ignored the order and made very large assumptions where there are none. If you research a round a little, you'll find out that what I said is true.   Conclusion: Roger the Wandererer is the Roger Smith who is fake. He is the lost faith Roger. Roger the Negoitator is the Roger who regains faith.  Rent or Buy?  BUY OF COURSE.           
 i love this deck. i once got it on my birthday, then ma sista got one.i wanted her blue eyes.i stole it.i am still copping with the fact i did somethin wrong.i just love it.i have twenty dollars, maybe i can buy 2 more of these. and give back my sister her blue eyes-?????????? 
 If you think run-on sentences and page-long paragraphs are a necessary conduit to recondite wisdom, then you might want to wade into this morass of Latinated English prose.  For myself, I think if the professor can't speak ordinary English I suspect that he's not thinking clearly.  I wish I would have been warned that this is a project of two of his adoring pupils.  And I wish I had been warned that couched in the ponderings are rationales, it seem to me, for disgust for the world as we know it, and reasons that Christianity almost has to be pivoted against Jewish religion.  I myself have thought that many good persons have been working on this issue to a much more agreeable resolution 
 Thankfully, Abigail Thomas followed the proverb, "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again," having recently composed a wonderful memoir of life before, during and (mostly) after her husband suffered a traumatic brain injury, entitled A Three Dog Life. Unfortunately, this earlier work, a 179-page collection of about 100 stories, ranging in length from one sentence to a few pages, was disappointing. In Safekeeping, snippets of her life from an eighteen-year-old pregnant wife, to grandmotherhood, her writing feels stiff and forced and even though I disliked it from the start, I trudged on hopefully. Unfortunately, my disappointment never disappeared and only wavered during two of the stories, I Ate There Once, about a conversation which takes place as she rides in a car with her second and third husbands and, What the Moment Can Hold, which tells of her feelings and actions during an encounter with her newborn granddaughter. Both felt authentic and true. As far as the rest of the stories, they seemed like what you'd get from an above-average college student if you assigned them to create a journal of life, specifying, "Write down any random thought you have." Additionally, it is written in the third person, which doesn't suit the theme, memoir-like "true stories from a life." Readers should skip Safekeeping in favor of her later and many-times-better memoir, A Three Dog Life 
 *No Spoilers* We had enough of lame Japanese films. This new "wave" of horror movies like "The Ring," "Pulse" and now "The Grudge 2" doesn't seem to have an end. The genre is played out but that didn't stop the producers from creating this sequel which is a sad and incomprehensible follow-up of the decent 2004 first version. To understand this film--which is nearly impossible until the end--you would have to see the first movie.  Brief Story: The film has basically three plots, but in a way they are connected to each other. The first plot is a follow-up of what happened to Karen Davis (Sara Michele Gellar) who barely survived the ghosts of the haunted house. Mrs. Davis (Joanna Cassidy) asks her other daughter Aubrey to investigate what happened to her sister Karen. She travels to Japan to bring Sara home. Now in Japan, she finds her in the hospital very paranoid about the ghosts of the house, but something terrible is about to happen.  The second plot is about three school girls who visit the haunted house. One of the girls has to go to the closet for some kind of initiation that we don't know about. Suddenly the girl sees the ghost of the child. She tries to get out but the door jammed. They all panic and leave the girl in the closet with the ghost. Unfortunately, they are about to find out the hard way that the place was not to be visited.   The third plot takes place in the US where a new family moves to an old building. A young kid suddenly notices that the building is haunted and the "strange lady" that lives next door has something to do with it. People are starting to act weird in this building because of the evil presence.   Review: Less scary and sillier than the original, "The Grudge 2" takes you to a boring and confusion movie experience. The movie suffers from too many plots that confuse the audience rather than scare them. We have to wait until the end to find out how everything relates to each other. This time around the ghosts are outsourcing from Japan to the US. They don't care whether you visit the house or not. Now these menaces are getting medieval to people for no apparent reason. These ghosts behave now like viruses that will haunt and kill whoever is on their way--even a young little boy--just to show their rage. The so-called scary moments are not scary at all. They are lame, mechanical and cheap imitations of the original 2004 first version. What's sad is that, this time around, the writers have to make the actresses show some "skin" to please the male teen audience. This is what the filmmakers have to use to get some kind of momentum going for this movie.  In the technical department the movie doesn't do a good job either. The editing is very sloppy and extremely confusion. We have three plots that are poorly mixed together. Sometimes we are in Japan and sometimes the ghosts are outsourcing in the US. The photography of the film is identical to its predecessor, but that's the only thing that resemblances the original. In the sound department, the movie will make you laugh. We hear sillier noises than the original. Instead of getting scared, you might laugh at the sounds these ghosts make--We personally like the angry "kitty" sound.  The Verdict: A terrible sequel of a decent horror film, "The Grudge 2" could have been a straight-to-video release if it wasn't for the beautiful Sara Michelle Gellar. No scary moments but many funny ones--unintentionally, of course.  
 Plain Truth, set in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, would be better entitled, Fancy Lies. An eighteen-year-old Plain woman wakes up with labor pains, gives birth in a calving pen, cuts the umbilical cord and prays, "Lord, please make this go away." When she awakens and the baby is no longer with her, she whispers, "Denke," and goes on with her day. Later, after the deceased body of an infant is found and the police are called to investigate, she tells them "I didn't have a baby," as blood trickles down her leg. Without providing spoilers, two (of many) implausible situations follow. First, two women, one old, one young, both separately become pregnant through one act of intercourse, defying the odds of fertility. Second, a criminal defense attorney who made a name for herself getting an acquittal for an elementary school principal who molested six students is actually very maternal and willingly leaves big city life with a boyfriend of eight years to live on an electricity-free farm out of the kindness of her heart. In summary, a two-page italicized section mid-book along with the first and last chapters provide enough details of the basic plot to save the reader from 400 implausible pages. Those interested in reading just one book by Jodi Picoult should choose My Sister's Keeper. Chris Bohjalian's Midwives is better. 
 Am I the only one who didn't get a complete book? At first I noticed there was some poor editing - lots of typos. But then after page 180, where page 181 should be (Sleep chapter), it goes back to page 117 (Discipline chapter that I already read). It continues to repeat pages 117 to 180 (a whole 63 pages duplicated!), then picks up again on page 245 in the middle of the School Days chapter that I don't have the beginning of. I'm completely missing pages 181-245 (67 pages).  Other than that, good for a few laughs and a handful of ideas 
 Cuba in 1953 - a Mafia-run world of vice, gambling, sex and drugs. Of course police and the government all get their share out of it. Only the young revolutionary Fidel Castro might be the next threat to the corrupt Cuban government. Therefore the Soviet Union sends a highly experienced veteran agent to support Castro. To counter the CIA sends in Earl Swagger with a single goal: to kill Castro.  The story development is pretty slow and did not really grip me. Unlike former books I did not want to stay up late to finish it. The reason is obvious: the story is not convincing and has two really big flaws right from the start: 1) We all know that Castro is very much alive today. So you know that the mission will fail (for whatever reason). 2) If you read other Earl Swagger books before then you know that Earl is no cold-blooded killer. Therefore the basic idea does not work at all. The concept of Swagger turning into an assassin is just not "Swagger-like".  There are some Western-style like shootings in the book that are typical for the author and Earl's skills are fun to follow as usual but they cannot make up for the otherwise pencil thin story. A great quote from Earl Swagger to support my thoughts: "No, I am not planning nothing except to get the hell off this place. It was a mistake ever coming. I have been shot at in too many hard places to die in a gutter in a city I don't know, for reasons I don't understand." Absolutely correct! The author should have followed this thought and should have let Swagger stay home! And I still do not understand why he wrote this story...  Further aspects that kind of spoiled the fun for me: This time Swagger meets Fidel Castro. And Meyer Lansky! (Who is next? Young J. F. Kennedy?) In "Hot Springs" Swagger knocked down Ben "Bugsy" Siegel. This time it is Hemmingway who is on the receiving end of of Earl's fist. (Again the same question: who is next?) It starts to get a bit ridiculous.  Therefore even if this is a Swagger book which (normally) puts it way above the average book almost automatically, it is not one of Hunter's best works. Actually it is by far the only boring book with either Earl or Bob Lee Swagger in it! (So far there are 7.) With "the day before midnight" (1989) Hunter already proofed that he does not need any Swagger character to write a fantastic page turner. Maybe it is about time for the author to invent a new hero and let Swagger rest in peace? 
 Joel Osteen almost never mentions the word "sin."  He's so popular because he tells people what they want to hear.  As for the book, it's garbage.  He says to stop thinking only about yourself and start thinking about others.  But the whole book is about thinking about yourself.  He says that you should be happy with what you do have rather than what you don't have.  But the entire book focuses on getting what you don't have.  He says Christians can get what they want by just visualizing and saying that they will get those things.  Does anyone other than Osteen actually believe that?  What about Christians who live in Rwanda, San Salvador and other poverty-stricken parts of the world?  Or does that way of thinking only apply in affluent societies?  He says Christians deserve special treatment.  But try acting that way at work or at a store and see how much others like you for it.  Don't read this book 
 I thought this book was one of the most depressing books I've ever read and I'm an avid reader. If this was the first Hamilton book I picked up I'd never read another. However I do know this is not the norm for her. I was left unsatistied and very sad about the fate of the characters that you had come to care about by the end (charachters were well written, just not the plot). Please don't waste your time with this one 
 Ho hum--I will never get my 5th grader to read this tome--however moving the story line and imagery.  It is too thick to easily add to a history block of Ancient Civilizations around the world.  The language is too dated.  The narrations dwarfs the action.  Children today (and writers for children are directed to SHOW the meaning and NOT TELL IT.)   Thankfully, author Geraldine McCaughrean wrote a wonderfully telling of GILGAMESH, so I turned around and ordered her retelling of ODYSSEUS.    Does anyone want my copy of Padric's version.  The cover art is great. 
 Maybe this book is good if you don't know any better, but I couldn't help but notice a Zionist slant when it came to discussing either the greatness or victimhood of the Jewish people, as compared to only about 6 instances of mere mention of the Arab people but only as slave traders.  So, there you go, the vilification of Arabs yet again by an unsuspecting Zionist.  Only 6 lines dedicated to a people who have been greatly instrumental in much of civilization as we know it today, and all this person can say is they were instrumental in the slave trade?  And lest we forget, Palestinian Arabs have been and still are victims of the criminal Zionists going on over 100 years now!  Where's that mention?  I thought this book was about race, why not mention the racism that exists today that is wiping out a large group of indigenous people today, the Palestinians!  Looking at the mega ratings this book has gotten, I suppose I'm one of the few people who would notice such things because this sort of Zionist superiority and Arab bashing is so rampant in this country it's often overlooked and is why it's so easy for us to bomb Arab countries without too much of an outcry.  But Arabs have contributed greatly to our world especially in the fields of medicine, physics, chemistry, mathematics, and astronomy, and I happen to be a big fan of their contribution to arts (especially music) and literature (too many to mention).  So it seems I will have to continue my search to find a book that isn't so self serving and narrow in its agenda disguised as defining race and culture. 
 I was initially satisfied but now it is essentially not working.  FirstI lost the remote temp and now the main unit is do dim you can't read it. 
 I find the mostly 5 star reviews of Adam Bede rather puzzling. I am a great of lover nineteenth century English lit, and have enjoyed the other three Eliot books I've read--Middlemarch, Silas Marner, and Mill on the floss, the latter being far and away my favorite. However, had I read Adam Bede first, I may not have bothered to read other Eliot works.   Eliot's talent is indisputable. The other reviews do an excellent job of capturing what is great about her prose, and many of those strengths are present in Adam Bede. What disappointed me most about this work were the characters. Each was far less complex than I have come to expect from Eliot, and I found the saintliness of Seth, Adam, and Dinah boring, almost irritating. It was hard to care about them. I also found, despite the explanations Eliot provided, that Adam's love for Hetty and Dinah's change of heart about marriage was implausible.  What sealed my opinion of this book was Adam's forgiveness of Arthur. After the devastation Arthur's actions caused, it would have been superhuman to forgive him, let alone regard him as a friend. When Arthur asserted that he suffered more than Adam, I could hardly believe that Adam did not recognize yet another expression of Arthur's massive ego.  Despite the book's strengths, this flaw, together with one-dimensional personalities of the main characters, relegates Adam Bede to an inferior status among Eliot's works.  
 I didn't really enjoy this book as much as the other Meg Cabot books I've read.  There were some parts in the book where I was like, "is THAT how you spell that," or "do what??" or "um, are you sure?" I'm not a professional writer, and I don't normally notice these kinds of things.  Take "bhang" for example.  I'm sure she's talking about a bong that you smoke from.  It's spelled b-o-n-g, not bhang.  Bhang is something you can drink, not the instrument used for smoking. For the record, I don't smoke, but every college student knows what a bong is. That is the only one that stuck out in my mind. I wish I'd bookmarked each and every one of them, because flipping though the pages I can't seem to locate any of the others, and quite frankly I'd rather not read the book again.  Don't waste your money.  If you have to read it, check it out from a library.  
 I assumed any Peterson guide would be good enough to provide a solid field reference.  This was an unpleasant surprise -- it is well short of the mark.  For starters, approximately a sixth of the book was bound upside down.  (I did not have enough time before my trip to return it.)  Next, the number of plates seems particularly limited and, finally, the number of birds covered seems far too limited.  The first two entries I went to while in the field irritatingly simply referenced other Peterson guides with no further detail.  Note to publisher: this diminishes the Peterson brand 
 I'm going to say something that might sound odd: this is not a leadership book.  It deals pretty well with the everyday tasks and details of Churchill's style, but strangely not his "executive success in the face of adversity." And Hayward's assertion that Churchill's style is  like that of an executive seems a little red-faced: Hayward spends a lot of  time defending against Churchill's critics that Churchill was disorganized  and a bad judge of character.  In all likelihood, he is forcing Churchill  into a category that he does not belong: indeed, Churchill may have been  disorganized, but he was a darn good prime minister. My opinion is that  Churchill deserves more than this. In place of this book, I would recommend  Lincoln On Leadership 
 If you were a Ludlam fan, and begin reading this book, you will be reminded immediately that he is dead.  How sad that a byline has turned into a trademark.   If you have a distaste for subtlety, and prefer ideas repeated and underlined in red, buy this book.  Shameful exploitation of a decent name 
 Please do yourself a favor and read the book rather than listen to this audio version.  The narrator, who speaks with a modern West-coast accent, is the absolute wrong choice for this funny, charming story set in the early 1900's.  Peck's humor is nearly lost in this monotone reading 
 Terrorists strike an America oil refinery with a small nuclear bomb. In steps Major Jason Richter, Army nerd extraordinaire, with his super CID exoskeleton. The hero of the hour saves a busload of kids, along with a beautiful reporter, and promptly gets placed on the newest war-on-terror team. The team starts to tackle the terrorist group responsible, but the team seems to be set up for failure with conflicting personalities and egos. The battles rage on around the globe, as Major Richter tries to pull the team together, find the mastermind behind the plots, and save his country from another disastrous attack.  Techno, yes; thriller, no. This book started out with promise and I really wanted to like it. But after the introduction of the major characters and gadgets, it quickly becomes cliched and predictable. The nifty new weapons systems would play much better with believable characters and a realistic plot. The pacing is fast, but the many twists and turns feel forced. Dale Brown is perfectly capable of writing exciting techno-thriller books with good characters - but this is not one of them 
 I purchased two sets of these speakers for the Kid's Room at my company.  Each set worked as a receiver rather than speakers, picking up AM radio waves.  The reception was GREAT!  But I believe the children would rather hear what is playing on the computer instead of the Mexican music coming through the speakers 
 This has to be a joke! How could've stars like Brando and Nicholson agreed to appear in such rubbish is beyond comprehension! Brando with the worst irish accent you'll ever hear, and Nicholson trying to play the clarinet!!Do the fans a huge favour and delete this horrible movie 
 This sleep inducer is more effective than Lunestar.  Page-fillers with interior and exterior decorations, story line schleppend (dragging); it's not that this Jewish girl lacks language skills. I praised her before, especially in Angel of Death. And if you want to convert to Judaism, you find a well of detailed information about rituals, superstitions, and customs. Her Jiddish words are spelled phonetically, yet they are of German origin in form of a dialect, in case you wonder. I am definitely not converting soon. The heroine, Miss Molly Blume (German for flower) is a sassy journalist, who reports crimes in Times. The good guys are strict observants of her faith (frum - fromm), the bad guys are not so frum, us not frum goys. The page fillers will put you into your own dream world with amazing speed, which is definitely more interesting than the Dream House. 
 Fiction doesn't get any more shallow than this, and don't let anyone kid you that it's a satiric comedy of manners. Gossipy name dropping and bed hopping may entertain Grazer's crowd but anyone with a brain is going to get turned off quickly. The book is a complete waste of time and money. I stopped reading after the first 10 pages. Yuck 
 Beloved is one of the most famous novels by Toni Morrison, America's only female to win the Nobel Prize in literature.  Set in the America before the Civil War, the story moves from the slave South to the non-slave North.  Free the North is not, as this book depicts, for slaves could be captured and returned down South.  The book is conglomeration of multiple themes and storylines.  First and foremost is the story of Sethe, a black woman who used to be a slave.  Second, the book focuses on her baby who died at birth, who goes by the name Beloved, and the reappearance of the baby as a ghost.    Third, the book examines slavery, racism, and the politics of inclusion and seclusion.  In the South, Sethe is excluded from civil society in many ways by her color and the institution of slavery, but being a slave, is an integral part of society in general.  In the North, she is not a slave per say, but instead she is excluded from society in general by the ways of white people and their benign racism.  The storylines of this book also explore the physical punishments and practices used to enforce slavery at the personal level.  Here is where this book stands out from others like it like Uncle Tom's Cabin or Huck Finn.  This book could be described as doing for black literature on slavery as what Passion of the Christ did for movies based on the Bible.  it is quite graphic with big servings of the natural thrown in.  But I would not use this book as a study of slavery and the racism built into it.  The text is very confusing and I, the reader, spent much time trying to understand the entity of Beloved, and its use in furthering the story.  In fact, I would call this book a tragedy not about slavery and racism, but a tragedy set against the backdrop of slavery and racism.  Overall, a difficult book to read and though not boring, is not on my list of great American works 
 Goldberg begins by relating his personal voyage from liberal to conservative, taking broad-brush swipes at liberals - elite, non-patriotic Bush-haters, citing 3-YEAR-OLD polls to "prove" that most Americans still support him.  (Let the BIAS begin!)  Then we get admiration for conservatives not wanting to tear up the First Amendment to stop vile music/cheesy TV - omitting reference to the FCC fining several broadcasters recently, Bush-Cheney's threatening the New York Times etc. for stories it disliked, and the administration's continual withholding/losing information to thwart the press.  (The BIAS continues!)  Goldberg is commendably upset regarding many Republicans' support for illegals, vastly increased non-war spending, and the current Iraq mess, and support from fundamentalists.  Then, with perfectly maladroit timing, Goldberg chastises Imus for his politically correct stand on race relations!  More commendable positions follow - he's down on Ann Coulter for her trashing the 911 wives, as he "winks" that she's just doing it for the money (gained from selling such vitriol to conservatives).  Regardless, Goldberg's anti-San Francisco Supervisors position banning display of the Battleship Iowa, and Baldwin's comparing Bush to Hitler (idiotic) are also credible.  However, Goldberg then goes on to try and have it both ways on global warming - pointing out that at least one scientist argues against the theory (and thousands of other scientists), and "supports" his implicit do-nothing stance by pointing out 80-year-old data that show things were formerly trending colder (prior to the major impact of CO2 emissions).  Regardless, even if doubt was warranted, given the potential disastrous effect and long lead times involved in global warming it still makes sense to take strong remediation efforts ASAP.  Somehow Goldberg then gets on to praising Goldwater's honesty - OK, he was honest, but Goldwater still scared me to death listening to him rant on and on and on and on about more military spending.  Finally, Goldberg gets to his paramount bit of illogical pessisism: we shouldn't expect competence in government, and thus it is pointless to investigate its Katrina failure (or those of 9/11, Iraq, education, drugs, Walter Reed, crime, . . .).  Bottom Line:  Goldberg is very well paid to write superficial and inconsistent drivel - a nice job, if you can get it 
 I love history and am a history minor, and yet I had a hard time reading this book.  It did not devote much time to the Twenties or the Great Depression and spent too much time on the 1940's and the cold war.  I had the opportunity to read the fifth edition of this book, the 2004 edition, and the fifth edition is far better.  It appears to be completely rewritten and makes more sense.  It also spend more time on each area of history.  The fourth edition, to put it bluntly, stinks 
 I own this shaver and I am not too impressed with it.  I bought it at the drug store and although it cuts the hair, it still makes my legs feel like I have stubble and havent shaved in a day or so.  I miss having a close shave, this does not deliever it.  I am currently looking for something better for the summer time 
 Well, the labels did it again. First, when they released the album "Dream" on cd. Their biggest hit from that album "You never done it like that" turned out to be a re-recorded version on the cd release. They did it again with this "Ultimate Collection." That being said, I love some of their other hits, especially "The way that I want to touch you." Luckily, the rest of the tracks are the originals. If you're looking for the original version of "You never done it like that", you would have to get the 20th Century Masters collection of theirs 
 I would advise anyone to checkout Muslimgauze. In his 15 + years of creating electro-middle eastern (?) music, he has pretty much done all this before, and he did it better. Tabla Beat's tracks all have the same feel to them.. straightforward and dull. The only good thing I have to say is that this is one of the cleanest and crispest recordings i have ever heard. Muslimgauze is rumoured to have about 130 releases in his career, you might like at least one of them better than this 
 Intelligent Design is, ultimately, an intellectually dead end. This is the large elephant in the living room of Mr. Woodward and Mr. Johnson. What is the practical use of a theory such as this? In what ways does it lead to expanding humankind's knowledge? To simply avoid answering this adds nothing to the "argument" for intelligent design. What great predictions will I.D. give us in the end? I find this history lacking in that it provides no real reason to use I.D. as a productive approach to science 
 As a white man, this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it.  If an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published! I am tired of the double standard! Thank god I didn't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library 
 Surely I'm not the only one who found this book totally [bad].  The only thing it made me wonder about is how it's possible to write such a thorougly BORING book about such fascinating women.  The writing is just dull and full of the author's biases and prejudices, which just aren't nearly as interesting as the subjects themselves.  It's written in that old-school feminism (negative, no fun) tone that thank God feminism has since moved beyond.  My advice:  find another book about women mystics not filtered through Flinder's lens 
 Alice Walker is a great writer, great woman.  This book, however, is a learning tool for how NOT to address/write about issues affecting those in another culture.  Walker's take on genital cutting is simplistic and ethnocentric.  For a critique of Western women's activism around this issue read Genital Cutting and Transnational Sisterhood: Disputing U.S. Polemics edited by James and Robertson 
 We viewers have been innundated with gay hustler movies lately, to the point where it's becoming a cliche. What is the endless fascination? Frankly, I'm sick of them. That said, I have to admit that I had a bit of a bias against this movie from the start. This movie did nothing to break out of the gay hustler cliche. The acting is pretty good (except for the whiny, cursing models) and pretty good-looking but the dialog is unbelievably bad. It pivots from soap opera exchanges to allegedly funny one-liners, although I did chuckle at the stuck elevator scene. Sad that some seemingly talented actors couldn't have been some better dialog. The plot has no real story arc or climax. It just sort of meanders from one scene to another without any real direction. The characterizations are pretty sloppy, too.  Ian is pretty well-developed but the screenwriter doesn't seem to know where he's going with Conrad.  Is Conrad a jerk?  Are we supposed to feel sympathy toward him because of his recent breakup? He comes across as petty and vindictive (the blanket incident described in the elevator) and that's a dangerous position to place a major character in. In any movie or story, if you have an unlikeable character as a lead, you'd better make sure s/he has some redeeming quality.  And Conrad has none.  Some of the minor characters are irritating, too: Emily and Ted although the grandfather was one of the bright spots of the movie. In the end, the movie never really answers the question posed in its tagline: "What are you worth?"  It would have been a much better movie if it did.  
 As a young woman I was appauled by Gurian's lack of respect for women as human beings.What makes me the most furious is his  shadowy writing which can lead a young woman to think she is  only worth something if she squishes herself to allow the  boys and men to take the lead in life.The resounding message is girls and women are potentially inferior and cannot because of  our hormones make important contributions to society beyond  traditional roles.I don't remember ever being taken over by  hormones and rendered down to a emotional bundle of primative  chemical reactions he believes all females to be. I agree with posters about this bridge brain foolishness.Gurian is a master at twisting words around and you have to read his  books being mindfull of his tricks.His book is full of agenda. 
 yet even some of you who agree that the album bites still say that "tub thumping" is okay, even if it "gets old after awhile". that song is CRAP!!! has to be one of the worst songs ever to get play. EVER! sounds like a bad radio commercial for some english beer they're trying to market in the states.  that song (if you can call a random string of cheesy choruses a song) makes the strongest argument AGAINST ANARCHY that i've ever heard. proves that people who can't agree on anything can't make a song that makes any sense or follows any consistent theme.  gotta go - just threw up in my mouth from the bilious memory of this worthless pop drivel 
 I was surprised how much this book was lacking.  It didn't even contain names that I considered to relatively common. Also, it only lists a name under its most popular spelling (under that lising it will give alternative spellings but still...)  I ended up buying a different baby name book.  This one just didn't cut it 
 As was described in other reviews, This book in big, unorganized heap of too short anecdotes (half page), which become boring very quickly. One of worst kind of popular science book. May be her talent are better suited for other fields. 
 Patti Lupone being one of my all-time favorite singers and Sweeney Todd being one of my all-time favorite musicals, I thought this CD would be a sure thing. Sadly, it isn't so. There are a few things that bother me about this recording, but none more than Ms. Lupone's take on Mrs. Lovett. Ms. Lupone is a great singer but, man, she was just all over the place in this concert. I don't know what happened but it sounds like she spent the entire evening trying to find the character and just never got there. I was sorely disappointed. In a perfect world, I could take George Hearn off this recording and put it on a disc with Angela Lansbury from the original Broadway recording. Patti Lupone is a wonderful performer, but you wouldn't know it if this was the only time you heard her sing 
 Since this is one of my top four all-time favorite films and I love films passionately, I am ABSOLUTELY beside myself in fury and anger at the HORRIBLE packaging on this magnificent film. I could forgive the lack of extras. I know A LOT of people working for these international movie conglomerates don't give a damn about the Classics (or even movies in general, really). But the lack of thought that went into the packaging of this truly great, PERFECT, scene-by-scene-, shot-by-shot, movie is STAGGERING. Not only do they include a throwaway line of dialog in the middle of the images, not only do they clutter it up with a bunch of extras from a scene in the boxing ring... they picture the villianess, not the heroine, with the hero ! Where is the original poster art !!!!! THe insert art !!! The half sheet art !!! The reissue art !!! There . isnt . even . a . booklet . . or . flyer . inside . NOTHING ! This looks like a release that belongs in the cheapie bin with the public domain stuff . Columbia Pictures.. I am shouting . At . YOU  
 Those who wrote positve stuff about this book, please tell me why nobody even mentioned that the authors did not give the answers to all the excises in the book? I just can not believe this, am I missing something here? Is this a math book? What am I supposed to do now with those questions 
 I would like to clear up some confusion regarding the use of the terms "illusion" and "delusion," which Freud himself distinguishes early in this book.  A "delusion" is something that is believed that is not true.  An "illusion" is something that might be true or false, but that is believed because we want to believe it. Religion is then regarded as the fullfillment of infantile wishes, implying that it is something we outgrow.  But Freud has admitted by his choice of terminology that religion might be true.  As to the question of Freud's atheism, the book cites, as I recall, evidence of both a Protestant pastor, and admirer of Freud, who considered him an atheist and a relative who said whatever else he was, he was not an atheist.  Freud does not attempt to resolve that difference, as he so easily could have. I know of no evidence anywhere in Freud's writings that he ever committed himself to atheism, at least, if "atheism" is defined as denying the existence of God.  (Broader definitions are possible.)  I conclude that Freud's underlying disposition is not so much atheistic as irreligious.  I say "underlying disposition," but I could just as well say  "bias" or "prejudice."  Now let us consider what that disposition, which never is proven, but which is clearly manifested, implies.  Since no justification is offered in any rational manner, we must look for a pattern in what is said.  A rubric that covers not only everything in this book, but perhaps everything he wrote, is "illusion."  Perhaps that was Freud's Freudian sloppy slip.  For his irrational bias against religion can easily be explained as an infantile wish that religion, by which he would have probably thought of the Jewish faith and the Christian faith as they were represented in Vienna at the time, were not true.  He didn't want them to be true.    A further consideration is that in this book Freud gives no evidence whatsoever of having investigated,  or even being familiar with, the evidence and the reasoning of those who defend their own religious belief or the demonstrable proclivity of the human race to believe and practice or feel guilty about their failure to practice, some religion.  In this he is just an intellectual of his time, a time dominated by materialistic determinism in the name of science.  I agree with those who regard Freud as a great writer.  His prose carries the reader right along, until the absurdity of the ideas makes you want to throw up.  I first read Freud at the age of 22, ploughing my way through "The Interpretation of Dreams."  Even then I could see that he was subjecting all his empirical, i.e. clinical, evidence into the framework of a system of subjective categories, which at the very least were dubious.    Freud's scientific pretensions were an attempt, unconscious perhaps, to give prestige to his new ideas.  At the time science was riding high.  Marx, also, for instance, regarded his ideas as scientific.  And I do not mean to imply that Freud was not a good observer, nor that he was dishonest, just deluded by his illusions.  He founded a very influential cult, that has lasted until our own day, although it has never gained anything resembling general scientific acceptance.  Several of his earliest colleagues broke with him, the most important being Jung and Adler.  That is typical of cults, which cannot bear the weight of more than one dominant personality 
 Zed (Sean Connery) hitches a ride inside of a giant, flying, stone head. Once aboard, he shoots it's occupant dead and flies off to "The Vortex", a place where the "Eternals" live. This is a land full of men and women who have no sense of what real living is all about. They just loll around, musing and pontificating about nothing. Zed spices things up for these immortal buffoons by being different and, oh yeah, by having a male organ that works! I kid you not! The rest is mainly Zed finding out that what he thought would be heaven is actually pretty dull. Unfortunately, so is this movie! John Boorman (Deliverance, Excalibur) wrote, produced, and directed this elephant tranquilizer. Although, it does get an extra star for that hilarious flying head.. 
 Not the best compulation I would have come up with. Only had one or two songs on it that I liked. But oh well Its in my collection now. Maybe it will grow on me later 
 these earings are the worst! they are way too heavy and the rocks on the bottom weent the same color! on was grey and one was black! I dont recommend this 
 The philosophical paradigm of this book is that culture determines the way people value and behave in the business world.   This book is relevant to readers who are new to the Chinese business world. Professor Chen from Darden Business School defines `Chinese business world' to encompass Chinese in the mainland and overseas. As the Chinese business world is very culturally-determined, he concludes that traditional cultural values govern how people undertake and organise their businesses in various aspects. Salient cultural values include family-oriented, guanxi and networking, the middle way, and patience.   Professor Chen concludes that Chinese culture and business practices are diametrically different from the West. If readers are quite familar with the Chinese world, they will find a bit frustrated because there are too many management studies that have fallen on this subject. Another limitation of this book is that Professor Chen assumes that cultural values and business practices of Mainland and Overseas Chinese are analogous. He fails to understand that the way to conduct  business is different between mainland and overseas Chinese. For example, entrepreneurs from Mainland China tend to be more speculative or opportunistic and less ethical than other Chinese entrepreneurs in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. 
 What the world didn't need was a 4-CD box set of the same, tired disco we hear on every K-tel compilation CD, and in this box set, they got it.  This is radio disco, not club disco.  There are no surprises, no lost or extended mixes, nothing we might have heard in the New York clubs in the 70s or early 80s.  Where are Freddie Mercury, Dennis Parker, France Joli, or Bonnie Pointer?  How many more times do we have to hear Y.M.C.A.?  Rhino really missed the dance boat.  Shame on them 
 There is no one experience that could somehow describe them all. I didn't find the book very interesting, nor would I recommend it as reading for those who are going to go on the JET Programme sometime in the future. In fact, I recommend you read very little of the 'foreigner does Japan' genre and stick with facts, figures and Japanese language. And basics of English language teaching. Believe me, you will enjoy your 1-3 years in isolation and miscommunication without your head full of pop-anthropological nonsense and you will come to know your full self 
 No color pictures, it has black/white "drawn" pictures, but the information about each plant has a lot of detail 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 sorry, can't finish this garbage movie. is this girl retarded  or what? watching her father been killed in cold blood and got no feeling or emotion at all. how and why the garbage collecting, turned cow feeder young guy, would then have turned into a cold blood stone cold killer? there's no enough logic and explanation why he would have turned into a psychopath. the girl didn't look a bit retarded but acted and behaved like one is also a not quite well developed character. the whole movie just looked too deadbeat and senseless. what? life was too boring then what? started becoming natural born killer? give me a break. bone chilling? you can always say that again, but won't make me care a bit more. 
 The depression era introduction was the best part of this movie as another reviewer mentioned. From the moment they reached King Kong's island the movie quickly spiraled to a painful viewing experience. I felt no sympathy for the big stupid ape. How can anyone feel anything for King Kong? He keeps a village hostage to a tiny part of an island, forces them to provide him sacrificial women, and tortures the female star of the movie. It seems so ridiculous that she ends up liking King Kong. The villains of the movie were my heroes. I kept hoping they would succeed in killing him so the pain of this awful movie would end 
 First off, the ipod jiggles no matter what you do, secondly, it doesn't stay straight on the power plug, it constantly tilts(the whole thing)...not worth $10 
 The book should be lsted as fiction, and not under history or theology. Mr. Kennedy should keep his act to the TV, where he can present baseless facts. His subjective biased argument does not help in promoting christanity, a more obejective would. "A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom" by ANDREW DICKSON WHITE does a far better job in presenting an objective analysis on impact of christanity on science. Struggle of Gallileo with the chruch is complete mis-presented by Mr. Kennedy 
 Not a very good book on any level. Not horrific, but overall really lame. A whodunit that you could never predict, because there was nothing to predict. It's like the author wrote the book and then when it came time to publish it, chose a character at random that 'did it' and wrote the last 10 pages. So save yourself some time, read the last few pages and make up your own adventure 
 Dear Customer Service, I am please about the refund; I am please about all thinks that I purchase from you. The web page where I bought: Zelco "itty bitty" Book Light, Volume 2 I believe is not clear. By looking the page I had the impression that I was going to buy a mini lamp where I was able to use the adapter for 110 volt and the lamp is a LED lamp.  At list this was my impression. Sincerely, Adrian 
 this band really effing sucks live... they had this huge, metal skull with batwings that FLAPPED.. and that alone made me watch to punch myself in the face for being there 
 Chris Hillman and Herb Pedersen, Bernie Leadon, Steve Young, the Woodys and even Burrito Deluxe?  Seems that whoever compiled this recording chose to do the usual thing that Nashville unfortunately is so well-known for - ignore and delete the stellar contributions of those who helped to propel Americana music or Alt-Country, namely those California Country Rocking boys who influenced the Marty Stuarts, the Jim Lauderdales, Dwight Yoakams, and so many others - and who by the way are still recording today - yet have been left off this album.  Vince Gill and his Notorious Cherry Bombs contribute a song called "Wait A Minute" but it sure isn't the same song written by his old friend Herb Pedersen, who was instrumental in taking the young, former replacement for Craig Lee Fuller in Pure Prarie League one step further on the way to Country superstardom.  Shame on You! - gosh, you could have included Rascal Flats and no one would have noticed the difference.  Oh yeah, there's a Dirt Band recording here. Not complaining, but up until recently the Nittys made Nashville their home, not L.A., Bakersfield, or Woody Creek. But that doesn't explain why Steve Young ("Seven Bridges Road") or Bernie Leadon who do live in the "home" of "country" music were excluded.  REMEMBER KIDDIES - if it weren't for two albums - "Sweetheart of the Rodeo" by the McGuinn-Chris Hillman-Gram Parsons-Kevin Kelley Byrds or the Burritos wonderful first album "Gilded Palace of Sin" Americana or Alt-Country might never have gotten an audience. You'd never be hearing this kind of music, nor this album. Ralph Emery and the original Nashville purists had done their utmost to prevent Country Rock (the precursor of Americana music) from being a viable music force - and sadly, those today who should appreciate what Hillman, Parsons, Clarence White, Gene Clark, the Dirt Band and so many others did can only throw a bone to Jeff Hanna and company, and to Emmylou. Forget the rest, they're as ignored as if "Drug Store Truck Driving Man" Emery was still running the show.  
 To listen to an obviously unhappy man about how to be happy 
 This book was a disgusting work of child porn and rape. While Sade had a pretty intresting point. This book seems to me to be a fantasy for the most disturbed morbid minds. If you find this book at all exciting go and register yourself as a sexual predator right now 
 This author recommends eating raw meat, raw milk, and raw eggs for some of her 'miracle cures'. Raw meat and dairy can kill you (cooked meat and dairy can too, but that's another book!). Don't take my word for it, click on the book cover and look at the index- you will find 'egg yolk for arthritis' and 'milk, raw' and 'milk for weight loss, raw'.   [...]  Ph Miracle and Ph Miracle for Diabetes are pretty good books. But one thing to keep in mind is that you need to be Ph *balanced*. Don't take alkilinity too far. Just as there are negative effects from acidosis, there are also negative effects from alkalinosis, though it is much more difficult in western society to be over-alkaline than it is to be overly-acidic.   The Ph of your saliva and urine should be slightly acidic at 6.4. That is what is balanced for humans.   Read about acidity and alkilinity in the book "Prescription for Nutritional Healing: A Practical A-Z Reference to Drug-Free Remedies Using Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs, and Food Supplements". This book is a wonderful reference for health and has never lied to me. After reading about those 2 topics in this book, you will be better able to tell the truth from a crock of raw meat in any Ph book. 
 Just what the world needs - someone writing a book on information that has not been fully researched on the subject of transgender.  A 'drag queen' does or does not mean or represent that 1 + 1 = 2.  Not all 'drag queens' are homosexxual.  Period.  Purchase a different book that has been resarch with today's information - not this one. 
 How he gets away with it I will never understand.Orson Welles was a Clown who dedicated his life to food and to criticize art in all of its forms.(that's what you do when you can't make art)Don't worry,there is always Rossellini,Fellini,Renoir,Bergman,Dreyer... ... 
 I scanned through this novel and picked it up on a whim. I made it through about a hundred pages before I gave up in disgust.  The writing is on the level of supermarket mystery shlock with some cyberpunk awkwardly tacked on. I found the author's style forced, dumbed down and ineffective. I could feel him wanting to create a picture and an atmosphere, but he just couldn't do it very well.  Morgan uses many predictable, derivitive sci-fi/mystery elements I found myself rolling my eyes more than once. It feels like I'm reading reheated leftovers.  Altered Carbon is just not very entertaining to me. I'm actually quite surprised it has received so many positive reviews. Readers are lauding this as an excellent first novel? I just don't see it.  I actually don't read that much of the sci-fi/Fantasy genre any more because of books like this. A few authors blow my socks off, and I look forward to reading their books because they have real writing talent. I can tell right now that Morgan will not be one of those 
 I'll admit it; I never was much of a Pretty Ricky fan, especially after listening to Bluestars. I mean, I like sex as much as the next guy, but that seemed to be all these guys ever talked about -- and it didn't help that they have very, VERY below-average rapping skills (and Pleasure's singing is pretty okay). And this trend continues on Late Night Special.  Now, I won't say that nobody likes Pretty Ricky; after all, this album DID debut at #1 on the Billboard 200. But I have to say that this is another one of those cases where I looked at the other reviews and now I'm asking, "Did we all listen to the same album?" And aside from all the usual sexual talk, the guys still rely on dated rhymes, like "let me do you after school like some homework" ("Leave It All Up to You"), "you got me feenin' like Jodeci" ("Love Like Honey"), and, once again, "if I'm lyin', I'm flyin'" (the title track).  As was the case with the first album, the guys aren't very impressive when they DON'T talk about sex either, mainly because considering the way they normally rap (lyrics AND style), it's kind of hard to then take them seriously (especially Slick). This is evident on "Stay" (but Pleasure's singing is pretty God-awful on that song too) and the necessary song about clubbing, "Push It Baby". And "So Confused" is aptly titled because the chorus is about being in love with a girl who's taken, but then the verses contain their usual dirty talk.  This album also contains a pretty statutory song, the aforementioned "Leave It All Up to You". But in the long run, maybe that isn't HORRIBLE because teenage girls are probably the only people that'll pick up this album. Like I said before, I have nothing against sex, but if that's all you talk about AND you're wack, then it's really a turnoff. I'm going to have to pass on this late night special and see what else is on the menu.  Anthony Ruper 
 The Taunton Press has published some excellent books - I especially like "Built-Ins". But this books seems to have been thrown together with little thought or integrity. Featured are numerous pictures that can been seen in their other books; this recycling of images is an affront to the reader - I never forget a photograph, and feel ripped-off when I recognize it from a different book. The Taunton Press should re-think its strategy; re-hashing previous publications and slapping on a new title is lazy, unoriginal, and insulting to its readership 
 The plot is baffling, the language is trite, and the characters are not even there.   I checked this book from the library, as it was features on the page of "The True Story of Hansel and Gretel" by Louise Murphy (which I truly loved). What a disappointment.  Do yourself a favor, and read Louise Murphy book instead. 
 This sounds more like a "country gospel quartet" collection.  For a much better bluegrass collection, try Rounder's "25 Years of Bluegrass."   Much better gospel bluegrass CD's are Ricky Skaggs' "Soldier of the Cross" and The Isaacs' "Increase My Faith" or "Pieces of Our Past.&quot 
 I picked this book up because it was on a book club's book list.  I actually had to go through InterLibrary Loan to get it since it wasn't available at my library.  After reading and forcing myself to finish it, I envision the head librarian at my branch shredding all copies to line hen cages, which would explain why a book club item wasn't available in a library.  Or perhaps the book club people had gone temporarily mad, who can say.  Many other reviewers have commented on the one-dimensional characters, the wooden pace, the absence of any attempt to sketch character motivation, but no one has mentioned the idiotic prose that flows, page after page, endless as the wine in Salim's cup.  "He looked down, and there was something sticking out from his belly.  It was a sword," is a paraphrased example of what you might find in this book, or with equal probability and more purpose, on an SNL skit.  This is a badly written book, if you had no interest in Mughal history, you will not have any interest in it after reading this book.  If you thought that was a wonderful period rich in complexity, you'd shred this book and line the hen cages too 
 It is extemely difficult to select stories from five of the greatest SF writers (add Clarke and Asimov and you have the top seven) of the 20th century to give the whole volume a negative, downbeat tone, but Fred Pohl has managed it.  If you like your stories upbeat and hopeful for the human race (in the editorial fashion of John Campbell) this book is a definite "save your money."  I have been reading these authors since the 1950s, and I can't imagine a worse set of choices 
 One of my single girlfriends and I (I'm married, 6 years this month) paged through this book at the bookstore the other day. If you want a laugh, it's great. If you're looking for sound advice, get another book.  The one thing people need to understand about John Molloy is that his so called "scientific studies" are bogus. He uses insanely small sample sizes, anecdotal information, and non-scientifically-selected subjects to come up with his conclusions. In a country of 360 MILLION people, I imagine you could come up with a few hundred people who married their spouse because they shared a love of online fantasy games and green chile enchiladas. Compared to the general population, his sample sizes are smaller than miniscule and therefore, the sweeping conclusions he makes are basically worthless. Anyone who's ever taken Statistics 101 can figure that out. You know that saying that there are three types of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics? That statement is never more true than when applied to this book.  Secondly, the conclusions he comes to "scientifically" are completely ridiculous. If you want to get married, be thin, make a good first impression and make marriage a priority. WOW! What a revelation! My single friend said "if only it was that simple." She is thin, beautiful and accomplished, and after a failed marriage 7 years ago has had no luck getting married since. She makes a great first impression and makes her living off that as a salesperson. According to Molloy, she should be beating men away with a stick and fending off marriage proposals daily. But sadly, that's not the case. Whereas I am a loud, brassy, overweight woman who probably comes across as outre when people first meet me, and I've been happily married for six years.   If you really, REALLY want to get married, here is my advice. I am giving it out FREE here on Amazon so people don't give John Molloy any more money for his silly books. Are you ready? Here it is: - Don't sit at home. Get out and meet people. If you live in a city of any size, there will be groups of people who assemble to participate in activities you would enjoy - everything from stargazing through telescopes to needlepoint. If you don't feel comfortable joining mixed-sex groups, join women's groups. Other women have friends, brothers, sons, etc. who you may like very much. The bottom line is GET OUT THERE. Sitting at home will NOT enable you to meet anyone you'd be interested in. - Make a list of the things you want in a partner, and then a list of your deal-breakers. Then go back over the list of your deal-breakers and really examine it. If it's more than 7-10 items long, you are probably being too picky. Just because someone is bald, or likes sci-fi, or hates Indian food does not mean they are not a wonderful person who would be a caring partner. When I met my husband, he smoked. I HATE smoking. He also had a few other habits that drove me crazy. But I could see past those to the wonderful, fabulous person he is. I could see he was great husband material (and believe me, you should evaluate people as potential spouses EARLY - don't feel shallow for doing so). I stuck with him, and just a couple of years into the relationship, he quit smoking. He is the most wonderful man I have ever met and I could not ask for a more loyal, faithful, caring, funny and intelligent man to be my husband. I am not talking about ignoring personality traits like "he beats me" or "he's drunk all the time." I'm talking about trying to look past the "Seinfeld" or "Sex and the City" criteria for dating. "I can't keep dating him, he has long nose hairs." So what? If he's a caring, stable person, he can clip his nose hairs. But a shiftless, abusive guy with good grooming can't change his personality.  - Here's the most important one. Love yourself. Invest in yourself. Even if you weigh 300 lbs, you should be getting your hair done, buying flattering clothes that fit you, and walking around with your head held high. I have been chunky all my life but I dated plenty in high school and college, because I decided early on that I felt good about myself and I was going to have a personality that attracted people to me, even if my looks didn't. My husband wasn't even the first guy who wanted to marry me, and believe me, I don't meet any of Molloy's "criteria." It's not because I am dazzlingly beautiful or I have a compliant personality. I am funny and smart, and I love to laugh and have a good time. That's attractive to anyone. (I also have a healthy self-esteem, if you couldn't tell. :) Don't let one or two jerks, or this book, tell you your marriage prospects are hopeless if you're overweight or not traditionally beautiful or you care about your career. You are a great person and you deserve love. Now go out and get it 
 I can not comment on a book that I have not received yet 
 I honestly admit I did not finish this book.  The topics jump from one to the next with no focus. The author reminded me of my worst profs in college; a self proclaimed genius with NO ability to write or communicate.  
 When I first bought the DVD I was so excited, I thought this was going to be a fusion of Pilates and Cardio.  I was dissapointed however when I watched it, as there was only a 20 something minute basic pilates rutine, then a 20 something very repetitive cardio section.  I have done the Winsor Pilates DVDs and I didn't find this one too challenging, there weren't enough repetitions for me to feel the burn.  The cardio section did get me sweating, but it was so repetative.  I definitely bought this DVD hoping for a full pilates rutine, so I was a bit dissapointed.  
 I rate it a 2 because it didn't give that much information.  Some people just don't have enough money to go out and buy books.  Especially young adults on a fixed income.  When I come to the internet I expect to learn  and read, not spend my money.  Thank Yo 
 This is the first book I've read by this author, and I thought it was horrible.  The characters are incredibly unrealistic.  Frankie is the most annoying of them all, second is Grace.  I couldn't relate at all, it took for ever to finish because I couldn't stand reading it, and it was just uninteresting.  I'll probably read another book just to see if this book is    not like her usual work.  I'm now reading a Dean Koontz book (one of my favorite authors), and it's so refreshing to read an author who at least has some characters that are relatable in some way 
 I love science fiction, and this book is science fiction, but with one serious flaw: The author is a physicist and  his lack of training in chemisty, genetics, and biology is an embarrassment throughout the book; which I guess is why he kept it to 90 pages; he ran out of things to say.  Having a physicist explain biology is like having a biologist explain physics. Hello?! Does this make sense? No, and neither does this book 
 I was so disappointed by this book I could not get through more than a couple of chapters.  The author may know about mountaineering, but he seems to know very little about Kenya.  Moreover, I found the writing to be ethnocentric and quite boring 
 The sling doesn't really do much...  the underwear is sized very small, so make sure to order your size accordingly.  When they say low profile, they really mean it.  If you really want underwear with a sling, go buy some elastic and put into your current tighty whities.    
 this book completely threw me. it starts ok but before long we're thrust from what appears to essentially be a humourous satire into something that's stagnant and disorientated. i have no doubts in my mind that paul beatty is a clever man but this just didn't grip me. if i start to read something i have to finish it but this was difficult. the man character tuffy can't seem to make up his mind if he's good or bad. neither can he seem to make up his mind whether or not he's a rascist. don't read this book unless you absolutely have to, and you'll never absolutely have to 
 I'm using this in an area where, as usual, there is no map data for the trails and roads. Navigating through old and obscured trail systems or just passable terrain, to known trails I've been on is very cumbersome requiring switching between screens and allot of thumb work when I should have my chin up navigating. Even then, the functionality is very limited. Seems a big step forward on the software would make this product a really great tool, but so far it's only a novelty item. In order to view the other trails in the area previously recorded I will need to purchase the $100 Mapsend software which contains no useful data for me, only provides the functionality of editing/creating my own base map. A function I can only do on my laptop, something I usually don't carry out into the wilderness.   Basically I bought this to use it to document my assaults on various ridges, passes, peaks and unknown road systems, while understanding my proximity to previously traveled routes to help me make progress. So far it's a 0/5 points in this department.   If you want to find your way back to points this is useful, however for other types of navigation involving linear objects, such as trails and roads, waterways the software isn't there yet 
 It always struck me as odd that anyone would accept what are clear contradictions in the gospels regarding the events surrounding the alleged resurrection as proof that the events really happened--that this is evidence of a story not contrived and agreed upon afterwards but indicative of the various subjective perspectives each writer brought.  Aside from the fact that the various accounts are too different to be attributed to this prior notion, Christians have a bigger problem; for they believe that the bible is the word of God and is authored not by man but God.  As such, there is no room for contradiction or the hoped-for subjective perspective.  In a nutshell, the standards for human testimony can simply not be applied to an alleged "inerrant word of God."     I give this book two stars instead of one because it has value to the "Josh McDowell" type Christians who think they can intellectualize their sky-daddy myth into credibility.  With this book on their bookshelf, they'll sleep easier at night.   Two stars for being a myth-keeper 
 this to is the absolute worst era of the misfits. i mean sure, it has some great songs(scream, saturday night forbidden zone) and im not one of those "no Danzig, no misfits" nuts, but really...this is just really really cheesy and average minus those 3 songs...i understand if they use a little cheese here and there, but this is quesadilla territory....everything following pumpkinhead is disgusting.  graves has an okay voice..i think he is either too overrated or too underrated...hes just average...drums are pretty good...and thankfully doyle has somewhat re-united with Danzig! the Misfits do have Dez Cadena playing with them today and im admittedly kind of excited for a new record put out by this line-up ive seen live twice, but the graves/chud era is a pretty bad one...his voice is too poppy sounding...this is one for the media player library 
 Bought this to cool my office desk.  I would say it provided a very gentle breeze.  I didn't mind that, I do not like being blasted with a shock of air anyway.  But almost exactly three months after  I bought it, the cheap plastic shaft broke.  I suppose I could try to fix it, the motor seems OK, but it is just not good enough to warrant the effort.  One star for good looks 
 It was actually not the cd I wanted But I do like a few songs on it. 
 Ditto to other complaints - won't separate easily- either by unscrewing or prizing.  Cheap, flimsy, leaks water also because no gasket.  I'm looking for something else and hoping reviewers will give honest good advice . . . this almost identical to product by Munchki 
 Vanilla Sky is quite a disappointment considering the presence of Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, Kurt Russell, and Penelope Cruz, among others! The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the plot is below average, while the dialogues/lines are way beyond "below average!"  Tom Cruise and the rest of this AMAZING cast are given terrible lines and bad roles.  A shame, really... The dialogues-oh my- the dialogues are beyond words... As for the plot, school plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better storylines!  It is truly sad... It seems as though the writers/directors/producers decided to go artsy-fartsy on us, following in the dreaded footsteps of other such "films" as It's All About Love and the Russian Ark. So it's a weak plot, and a GREAT-but-wasted cast and setting, which when put together fail to take off.  No masterpiece here. 
 This was less of a biography then an extended Rolling Stone record review.  The only thing Dave Marsh likes better than Springsteen is Dave Marsh.  If you want to read the author repeat his interpretation of the lyrics for hundreds of pages and harp on a couple of his own simple-minded themes over and over then this is the book for you.  I found this book almost unbearable to finish even though I am a big Springsteen fan 
 The book earned two stars because it brings out the importance of strong communication in romantic relationships.  However, there was nothing new or exciting found among these pages that we have not heard at least a thousand times before.  While some of the suggestions might lead to romantic nights, I found them to be extremely childish in nature.  If you are in your twenties when everything love is new and you have not yet had to cope with the everyday trials and tribulations of life, these ideas might work.  However by the time one reaches their forties, fifties and beyond, you have probably already tried all the cute little suggestions found here and are looking for something more substantial on a higher maturity level.  Personally, I would be far more intrigued by an intimate candlelight dinner for two, or spending a romantic week-end for two at my favourite get-away, as opposed to leaving each other "little cutsey coloured cards."  For many, there is certainly nothing in the book that will start your heart racing or your hormones raging 
 At first glance, you'll think these are great - but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt. 
 This is the worst war picture I have ever seen with the possible exception of "Corregidor.&quot 
 I could not get this unit to work wirelessly with the Sony Locationfree LF-PK1 and an Apple Airport Extreme router.  I WAS able to use the Buffalo Technology AirStation Turbo G High Power Wireless Ethernet to stream TV to PSP wirelessly and across the internet. Tech support was fine, the device was just incompatible with my apple router 
 First off, let me say that I know next to nothing about art.  I would like to cultivate an appreciation for great artwork, but it certainly does not come naturally - especially when it comes to modern art.  Dali, however, is a master I at least have some affinity with.  Who doesn't know of the melting clocks?  I have also seen the dream sequence he created for Hitchcock's film Spellbound in 1945.  Plus, the guy was just plain weird, and that is something I know a little bit about myself.  This Artists of the 20th Century DVD looks solely at Dali's artwork.  All you see throughout the 50 minutes of video is one piece after another.  There is no biographical look at the man, no mention of his contributions to the world beyond his paintings, and certainly no commentary on his eccentric personality (or mustache).  There is not even an adequate identification of Gala, his inspiration and muse, despite numerous references to her in his paintings.  Thus, this DVD will not introduce you to Dali the man or Dali the artist - it only looks at selected pieces of the art work of the maestro.  Dali's artwork is obviously impressive, and I was surprised by the variety of his work and styles.  The narrator offers insight into some paintings - others, you just look and advance.  I don't understand a lot of Dali's work, nor can I see some of the things the narrator tells me are in his more abstract pieces.  The melting clocks and other surrealist images appeal to me.  Dark works such as Visage of War speak volumes to the human observer, and the disappearing bust of Voltaire paintings are also striking.   I was most impressed by the small sample of classical pieces Dali painted, however - largely because I did not know he ever produced such works.  My idea of a painting equates with something like Design for the Interior Decoration of a Stable-Library, which is a strikingly beautiful work.  Is this DVD worth watching?  I will have to say No.  If you're a know-nothing novice like me, there is not enough basic information provided to really illuminate the artwork you will be shown.  If you're knowledgeable about Dali, you'll be disappointed by the limited nature of the production and by the exquisite Dali works excluded from the show.  After watching this, I decided to peruse some Dali galleries online, and I must say that the Internet makes this DVD of little value.  Not only are the analyses and critical comments you will find online far superior to the information provided in this video, the quality of the paintings themselves are far better online than they are on the DVD 
 The book A Gathering of Days is a journal of a young England girl growing up facing some trials and tribulations.  The whole book consists of Catherine's journal entries about her happy, sad, and eventful life as a young child growing up in England in the 1800's.  The journal was given to her by her grandmother, which later Catherine passed down to her granddaughter.  Catherine experiences many difficult times as a child.  At the beginning of the book, Catherine's mother dies leaving her with her father and siblings.  Later in the story her dad remarries and Catherine has to get used to living with a new brother and step mom.  Her step mom teaches her many new things though that she never would have known, like quilting.   	The whole narrative is told from Catherine's point of view.  She describes through her journal her feelings and emotions that she is going through as a child growing up.  The story is realistic in such a way that young girls or even children can connect with Catherine as they may be facing the same situations that she does.  By reading her journal, children can also see what is was like to grow up in England and compare it to their lives.  The author does an acceptable job of describing the characters so the reader is able to visualize them in their head.  The story though is a bit confusing because it is written like it was back in the 1800's.     	The overall story was okay.  It was realistic in such a way because the reader could see what it was like growing up in England in the 1800's.  The reader could also connect with the main character as she describes her feelings and emotions. 
 Although this is a board book and it says for babies and toddlers, the book itself is not sturdy enough. My 2 yr old son broke his book the first day by pulling the pages apart. This wasn't too hard to do. Basically, the pages are split in half so you can make the figure in the picture look like it is moving. If you pull the top half up and the bottom half down too hard, the page comes out. It's a cute concept and my son loves the pictures of the Toy Story characters but the book just isn't sturdy enough to stand up to a toddler 
 I saw this recently and was to say the least, very disturbed by the video surveilence of Kell KILLING Blackmon. It is a very sad true life story of one very disturbed individual. Troy Kell comes from Nevada, he has, now, no life..he has not had one since he was 17. He was incarcerated for a BRUTAl murder of a Man who was "stalking and harrassing" his childhood friend, "Sandy". He committeda brutal crime, shot a man 6 (SIX) times in the head at close range. This documentary shows the real inside of prison life, allbeit through the eyes of a very disturbed young individual. Kell is articulate and comes across as highly intelligent. But is he really?, he is now on Death Row. Very good documentary but also very disturbing 
 Quite possibly one of the most poorly-thought out rants I've read yet on the whole "entertainment is destroying America" controversy.  All arguments he presents are simply straw men that he's created to bolster his point.  None of the serious criticisms that have been laid against him and his work have been seriously addressed.  Don't waste your time with this drivel.  One star 
 I was disappointed in this product.  The butter slid out of the bell and into the water.  I think it would be better if the inside of the bell wasn't glazed 
 i loved the ideas presented in this book, and i do read alot of books about the media, modern technologies, and their effect on our lives and on the society.  although the presented ideas are great, the style of the writing gets to me every time.  absolutely terrible.  im not sure if the author was trying to exemplify the mass confusions, lack of attention span of today's society through the litteral writing, but it detracts from the points that he makes.  many examples are presented have no form of organization whatsoever, and many arent even necessary.  zengotita could have conveyed the message of the book in half the length and it would have been more effective than this book will ever be 
 I saw this movie as a kid when it came out and liked it, but since then it has gone through something of a critical reevaluation. Goodman is an entertaining actor, but there are just too many factual errors, and they arguably detract too much from the film's quality.   As was noted elsewhere by other reviewers, Goodman's Ruth does not represent a great athlete. Ruth was not overweight growing up, nor in his early days as a ballplayer. Ruth's weight did fluctuate, but few to this day know that Ruth had 123 career stolen bases, and actually led the Yankees in steals one year (1923). Goodman's character was unreasonably slow, and at the end was portrayed as unable to run the bases even on a home run. This might work as light humor, but it certainly is not fact. Also of note, Goodman was a natural born right-hander that had to learn how to bat and throw left-handed like Ruth for the purpose of acting in this film. This makes Goodman look awkward, and even less like an athlete on a few occasions.   On the other hand, I understand as a general rule that playwrights and filmmakers are given a certain "artistic license," and that it is alright on some occasions to stretch the truth for a purpose. The bloated portrayal of Ruth might be one such example, no matter how erroneous it is from a factual standpoint. Even so, many of the inaccuracies have no discernable purpose. Case in point,  "Jumpin' Joe" Dugan was never a teammate of Ruth's in Boston, only in New York. It is also known that Ruth did not have any home runs in 1914, but according to this movie he had one that year. In addition, Ruth was not the first player to hit a home run at Forbes Field. The list could go on for a while, and there seems to be no reason why the filmmakers decided to alter such facts. "Jumpin' Joe" may have been put in there just to have a veteran teammate friend for Ruth, but Dugan started his career three years after Ruth did, so he could not have been a veteran to Ruth at any point in his career. They could have picked someone else to fill this fictitious "veteran teammate" role, or scrapped the idea all together. The 1914 home run served the purpose of providing a dramatic rookie year home run, but this scene could have been set in 1915 instead, and with some modifications perhaps could have been just as dramatic. Lastly, regarding Forbes Field, the announcer could have said a true statement along the lines of "Forbes Field is a pitchers ballpark, not many home runs are hit here folks," as opposed to the inaccurate "no one has ever hit a ball out of Forbes Field." The latter line had a dramatic effect, but was not necessary.   Also of note, Ruth's supposed "meeting" with gangster Alphonse Capone seemed a bit absurd, perhaps this was thrown in to get a glimpse of the times. Aside from the dicey misrepresentations though, there were a few strong qualities. The acting was strong overall, with Ruth's two wives giving strong performances, and Goodman's performance was not a total wash, even if there was too much over-the-top buffoonery. And let it be said that this film does have the ability to evoke some of the excitement of the game of baseball - a sentiment especially felt as an eight or nine year old viewer. But as said by Derek Armstrong, there were "too few ambitions toward a greatness to match that of its subject matter." 
 OK, I know I'm going to get hammered for this; once again, there goes my reviewer rating. But I just HAVE to be honest: this is a terrible story. OK, being that it's Shakespeare, it's prettily told, but it's still a HORRIBLE story, and I can't imagine why otherwise sensible people like it. Perhaps they feel that Shakespeare is telling it tongue-in-cheek (it IS a comedy, after all) and poking fun at the system of fathers marrying off their daughters without any concern for whether they want it or not; that would almost make it tolerable, if I could believe it. But given that it IS a Shakespearean comedy, we must assume that the ending is supposed to be a "happy" one, and the situation at the end is far from pleasant. Or perhaps people believe (I've heard this claimed in all seriousness) that Kate has actually "triumphed" at the end, having figured out how to manipulate Petruchio so as to get her way subtly and underhandedly. Even if this were true, I'd hardly consider it a "happy" anding, and personally, I see little evidence of it.  No, what we actually have here is a story of a strong woman (some people seem to like it simply because there IS a strong woman to be found in it) being married against her will to a scheming golddigger who "Tames" her by blatent if indirect spousal abuse (he doesn't beat her, simply starves her and sleep-deprives her, as well as forcing her to wear muddy rags until she behaves exactly as he wants, up to and including winning him a bet by lecturing her contemporaries on their duties as obedient wives. Her spirit may or may not be broken, depending on how the part is played, but the fact remains that she's forced to BEHAVE as if it is, and that's not a message that should be bruited about in a "comedy". This is absolutely the WORST of Shakespeare's plays 
 Title is self explanatory, I'm very busy to write reviews but I needed to make this one, make sure nobody gets fooled by brand name , at medium prices and ultra low quality. I've bought a 5$ nobrand knife from TOP and is WAY better that this 
 I bought 3 books on this subject this week, and this is the one I wish I hadn't bought. I am so disappointed in this book. I was expecting a true workbook, and there is no real plan in this book. There is a lot of interesting information, some of which is useful, but if I hadn't also bought The Seven Secrets of Slim People, I wouldn't have gotten a plan to actually do the work I need to do to be able to find out when I'm hungry and when I need to stop eating 
 I wish I had listened to the previous reviews about mistakes in the patterns but there were so many other good reviews I thought - maybe they were wrong.  I should have gone with my initial instincts!  I'm still working on the 20 square afghan and have had to consult the web constantly to figure out how to do a stitch b/c the book instructions were either wrong or not clear.  I'm not sure how the other reviewer finished hers without any problems.  Anyway, I enjoyed learning new stitchs but following these instructions were a nightmare.  I wouldn't recommend this book at all 
 I love Jane Austen.  I firmly believe that if Jane were to time travel to the future she would throw this book in the trash were it belongs and run, not walk; back to her time travel machine. She would  return to her own time where garbage like this would not have gotten published .  It was predictable, ridiculous and poorly written.  The names of the characters all throw back to Jane Austen stories, including the cat(Wickham!?!?!)  I am all for escapist reading but this was un-readable and left me angry and annoyed.  If I could time travel I would travel to the author's home pre-publish time and erased every copy !!! 
 The Summary (short version)  The characters...  Go to restaurants and drink.  Go to bars and drink.  Go home and drink.  Go to bullfights and drink.  Insult each other and drink.  P!ss and drink.  Go to sleep, wake up and drink.  Take baths and drink.  Have sex and drink.  I became an alcoholic just by reading The Sun Also Rises.  Summary (the long version) Several expatriates lick their emotional wounds and cavort around spending money left by their rich parents. The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is a reporter left impotent by a war wound. He and Uncle Toby from Tristram Shandy could have had a ball together (if you've read Tristram Shandy by Laurence Sterne, you'll get the joke). He's in love with the beautiful Brett Ashley, but his impotence makes it impossible for their relationship to have much substance. She falls in and out of love with other men while he stands around watching and feeling jealous. A little bullfighting and violence and drinking later, they're right back where they started: in limbo.  I've never cared for Ernest Hemingway's writing style. It's like he made sure you knew you were reading a story from a REAL man: very macho in tone and style.  And this coupled with the boringness of the story makes The Sun Also Rises a dreadful read 
 The loneliness, sparkling wit and beautiful simplicity of the original Purple Crayon books (and the quite loyally adapted Gene Deitch animated cartoons - still available from Scholastic) are not to be found here, sacrificed to the treacly situations and inexplicable pastel colors of this confused, frustrating - and to this viewer at least - insulting "interpretation." It's as if Harold were aesthetically reincarnated as one of those hard sugar figurines manufactured for quick decoration of grocery store birthday cakes. I bought this believing that the Emmy bestowers would actually have some sense of taste when awarding their prizes, but in this case, I simply ended up tossing my set away. (I only am posting this as a warning to anyone who might be hoping to find some flavor of the original works in this adaptation; contemporary kids might like this on its own terms, which is "the way things are" -but this is not Crockett Johnson's "Harold." 
 Although most of the advice is pretty standard that you get in any how-to-write book, my two stars comes from his statements that you must have a premise (such as "Cheaters never win") before you begin to write. This kind of approach is perilous for beginning writers, leading to work that can be preachy, predictable, and cliched. Many times, the true premise of a story or novel makes itself known during the revision process, but to begin your first draft that way is to try to shoehorn your story into an ill-fitting formula that serves neither the reader nor the writer 
 I'm trying to figure out what the appropriate subtitle for this book should be and I can't decide among the following:      * Travels Through Guilt with the World's 33rd Richest Hippie     * The Mind of an Empty Suit     * A Self-Important Revisionist History     * How I Learned to Hate Myself and Love the Third World     * Memoirs of a Cold War Paperpusher  Confessions of an Economic Hitman by John Perkins is an exclamation point riddled history of a few financial manipulations of the Cold War by a man who had no stake in his own ambition.  The first thing you notice about this account is that it is written by a man who thinks he was sitting on top of the world, when in fact he was just a cog in the energy industry. If you are credulous enough to believe that the debts and revenues associated with the energy business is indeed the core principle of the global economy, then the moral outrage of this book makes sense. But there's a whole lot to swallow.  On the plus side, it's a fast and somewhat entertaining read. Otherwise it is a exercise in the slow revelations of a kind of self-loathing that takes about 20 years to surface.  One of the things that I've had in mind as I was reading this screed was the sense of geography as destiny. As I look at the 20th Century, I think of most of it focused on the economics of . Perkins was one of the people who made the truth a narrative of economic exploitation. He falls in love with Socialist charismatics in Latin America, rues the lives of poor peasants, and bemoans the basic nature of corporate capitalism without ever acknowledging or even understanding the basic nature of socialism.  Perkins is a perfect example of a cultural relativist. a perceptive reader can see how much he hates his hometown and parents and idolizes romantic ideals associated with revolutionary rhetoric. But you can't imagine that he even had the temerity to read Marx, Weber, Engles, Friere or anyone. Back when I was a bit more blackified, I referred to such people as culture vultures. If it's indigenous, it's good. But you'll never see him once talk about infant mortality statistics, literacy rates, crime rates or even inflation.  I discovered a bit too late that this book would teach me nothing about the business of foreign direct investment or the workings of the World Bank except that he saw it as evil. Technically, you'll get a great deal more insight reading Wikipedia. Basically, Perkins assumes that his game was the only game on the planet, his company was smack dab in the middle of it and that it was all being subtley directed by the CIA and NSA and that this is, was and always will be the American way. You really get a foggy view of the Evil Empire of America from Perkins, who resembles nobody quite so much as a cynical wanker who is too soulless to quit the game. It's a confession all right.  By the time I got 2/3rds of the way through, reading the book began to become annoying. The incredible vacuity of this man was staggering. There are no personal relationships in the book worth speaking of. He found loyalty only to his bosses worth mentioning. It is a stunning revelation about his character that he never once had a kind word to say or any personal quality worth mentioning about his staff that stands out in memory.  We learn that he took one of his charges (female) on a yacht cruise to some isle in the Caribbean, but that when he got there, he was so sickened by his guilty conscience that he banged his head against the coconut trees.  If you want to understand something about the life of an economist and high finance, the best book I've read is My Life as a Quant. If you want to understand something about the life of a reluctant spy, the best book to read is Larry Kolb's Overworld. If you want to get well-written account of a man who was too spoiled to find himself while being a toady in the economic hardball of the Cold War era, then this is your book. But it's nowhere near as good as, say The Quiet American.  You can imagine that Perkins, who is a great admirer of Graham Greene, might have had aspirations to be such a character as Greene might pen. He is earnest to tell such a story that would portray himself thus, but he is to honest to consider himself heroic, and I suspect that he'll be working off his guilt for the rest of his life. In that regard, 'Confessions of an Economic Hitman' is (now prefaced and extended in the paperback edition) a blueprint for American liberal guilt. If there was ever someone who truly believed that global warming and a host of other blowbacks are destined to doom America to a well-deserved kharmic smackdown, it is John Perkins. He has always been a citizen of the world pretending to be a patriotic American, down to the repetitions of his undying faith in the words of Thomas Paine. You'd think, being a pseudo-economist, that he'd have some room in his heart for Alexander Hamilton. Ahh but that would mean that he'd have to admire courage.  I didn't want to be a harsh judge of Perkins. I thought I might learn of an extraordinary life, one of conviction and then epiphany. Instead I learned of a small yapping dog who was always on a leash he lacked the spirit to gnaw through.  Someone who would tell us in the end that we should use less oil and that 'corporatocray' is evil. This book has been a disappointment in many ways. I may well be very happy to read Thomas Friedman after this.  Good parts?  Yeah there are a few. He speaks about a few South American presidents who might have been contenders. He gives a few details about Saudi Aramco. But compared to Larry Kolb's fascinating and detailed portraits of Daniel Ortega and Adnan Khashoggi, this is Romper Room. If Perkins thought he was an agent... don't make me laugh 
 I bought this book for the Flower Toggle Hat Pattern, wanting to make it immediately for a gift.  The CO amount doesn't make any sense, but I went ahead with it anyways, thinking that the author is sure to know better than I do.  The completed hat (size 2-3 years) wouldn't fit a cat, let alone my niece.  CO 49 stiches with 22 st/in couldn't posssibly yield a hat to fit 17in. circumference. None of the sizes work out, and I used the recommended yarn, and knitted a gauge swatch.  ANY IDEAS???  Has Ms. Guy put out a correction?  I love the designs, but am not confident to undertake a major project when such an error was found in the first pattern I tried.  I'd still love to make the hat if anyone has the correction.  
 Heck, why SHD I be sorry for you, Dan - you're sitting on a gold mine 
 Don't bother buying this one. If you are a big Bette Davis fan, check out the library. You won't feel cheated. The book is dull and shallow. Can't say I care for the author's style or her content 
 Medicre book, but service and delivery of the book were superb 
 I just wanted to know what song the mariachi band was playing right before the president requested his song 
 I really think I wasted money for buying this stuff.....it's just worthless and not working at all. 
 This text is too weak at least in important topics like capital budgeting (risk analysis and real options, mainly), MM propositions and portfolio theory. The part on "scenario analysis and Monte Carlo simulation" took less than two pages, but the authors made a recommendation that is a big mistake: "the Monte Carlo Simulation should discount cash flows at the risk-free rate" to calculate the NPV distribution. This is true only if the cash-flows were simulated with risk-neutral stochastic process (i.e., processes with drift penalized by a risk-premium), but the book was referring to "real probability" simulations, so that the book statement is a mistake. Other example, the infantile critique on real options (p. 814): they associated real options (RO) with the internet bubble in 2000, and that RO explained that very high values. Of course RO adds the flexibility value to NPV, but the serious RO literature never supported that bubble. The perhaps best known RO article on internet firm valuation (on Amazon.com value) was Schwartz & Moon (Financial Analyst Journal, May/June 2000): using RO they estimated a price equal to $12.42, whereas the "bubble" stock market price (in 1999) was $76.125, a big difference... (see also Hull, 6th ed., p. 718).  Other RO critique that I don't agree is: "estimating ... volatility, opportunity costs, etc., can be complicated". Apparently, the authors don't know that if you have data to estimate the risk-premium for the discount rate (using CAPM concepts, for example), you can use the SAME time series to estimate volatility. The popular approach to estimate this volatility is just a simple linear regression. In short, if the market is complete enough to calculate the traditional NPV, so is for RO valuation.  There are much better textbooks available. The traditional Brealey & Myers' textbook remains an excellent choice, mainly for capital budgeting topics. Other good textbook alternatives are Ross et al (mainly for financial decisions, agency, etc.), Grinblatt & Titman (great in risk management), Bodie & Merton (introductory) and  Benninga (Financial Modeling, a practical and correct book) 
 Ugh. An unfunny waste of an hour and a half. Even the DVD Menu Screen is painfully annnoying. This film boasts 2 awards on its cover, one for Best Film at the Vail Film Festival and one for Best Actress in the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. It is so bad that henceforth, mention of either of those two festivals will be a Black Flag when I'm deciding what not to watch. Before the third act even started, I emailed the good people at the Vail Film Festival to find out what other films were there in 2004, when this won, because I'm a masochist and I'm utterly fascinated to find out-- and yes, ultimately watch-- the kind of trash this movie could have possibly beaten. They have yet to reply. I can only hope that if Andy Richter knew this was the kind of work he'd be doing, he would have shackled himself to Conan's desk "Saw"-style. I had a running debate with myself whether Bryan Cranston's character's obnoxious foreign accent was in the script or if he added it in a futile attempt to spice things up. Said debate was far more entertaining than the film. Highlights for me were two moments of sheer confusion and panic which required me to look up the cast credits online to reassure myself of my own sanity: "Dear God, is that Supergirl?" and "Dear God, is that the lead singer of Korn?" Other than that, the best feeling this movie gave me was relief, when the end credits started to roll less than 90 minutes after the opening credits. Not only do I wish I could assign a score of zero stars, I wish a mechanism existed which would allow me to take away the stars given to this film by other reviewers and dispense those stars equally among Gigli, Empire Records, Catwoman, and Tom Green's filmography in its entirety 
 I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  It is mostly made of cardboard and tons of very small pieces.  It is not sturdy and most of the time falls over after every little piece has been placed on the shelves. In putting it together and punching out all of the cardboard pieces, we even tore a few. There are many other Barbie sets that I would  strongly suggest in place of this.  This toy is not durable and is very frustrating 
 I am returning this book. I have not read it, I am angry the book has 81 pages , I am not sure it is an entire book. You had the audacity to charge me $ 4.98 when on the face of this book it is marked $2.99. If that is the way you do business, I don't want to do business with you .I feel cheated and disappointed 
 Please do not be put off from reading other John Irving novels because of the negative reviews, including mine, of "Until I Find You." Absolutely check out "The World According to Garp, "A Prayer For Owen Meany, or "Cider House Rules." Irving is masterful at creating unique, quirky, endearing characters. But not in this one. Any likable character in this novel is miniscule and rare. In addition, I am still pondering Irving's eerily light treatment of the overwhelming amount of child abuse his main character Jack has to sustain. Sexual abuse is dished out by practically every girl or woman Jack encounters.  This makes for a depressing book that also seemed to go on far too long. That said, I strongly recommend this author as one of the best at walking the thin line between comedy and tragedy 
 I purchased this book as part of a required reading for my high school honors geometry course. It is perhaps the most utterly boring and fanatical piece of fiction I have ever read. Not only is the book completely devoid of plot, it is lacking in all aspects of what a true work of fiction should include. This book has not educated me further on geometric concepts, nor has it enlightened me of any time period of which this book is said to be mirroring. Instead, it has wasted my time, which is precious to me now, and has completely confused me. Do not purchase this book. Do not assign it as required reading and most definitely do not read it for pleasure. There are other 80 page books that you can spend your time on.  Read anything else before you read Flatland 
 Problems have been reported in the Teacher's Guide for the 1997 Edition of this textbook. .. 
 The first two short stories seem to have nothing to do with the main story. I couldn't stand Harriman. If an enginneer says it is impossible or the plan needs to be changed, he should agree with them and change it. The story itself is boring because you never learn much about the main characters 
 I wish someone had warned me -- as I'm about to warn you -- just how lame this movie is.  A low-key, though stylish, story about a mismatched couple whose relationship implodes, this movie finds a tenuous comedic premise in the idea that neither of the ex-lovers is willing to move out of their jointly-owned condominium, and thus are present to torture each other day after day.  She brings home cute guys to make him jealous, he retaliates by throwing sleazy strip-poker parties, and so on.   There are a lot of factors that make this such a lame movie.  In terms of the overall structure, the decision to go straight at the beginning of the movie into the Big Fight that ends their relationship sinks this story right from the start.  We never see them as a happy couple, and never understand why they were attracted to each other, why they were pulled apart, etc.  In short, there's no character development, and no buy-in from the audience -- we just don't care about either of them.  That's a big drawback.  Also, there's no real chemistry between Anniston and Vaughan, and meanwhile the script and pacing are both rather slack... Nothing really clicks here -- the story, the acting, the direction, all blah.  That being said, it wasn't until the very end of the movie that I realized that what the directors were aiming for was a Woody Allen-style character study, a Serious Film.  The first inkling comes when Vaughan delivers his big, serious, take-me-back monologue (which was painful to watch; he was woefully miscast) and the clincher comes in the final scene, where the two ex-lovers meet a year later and have an awkward, um-hi-how-are-you conversation, ala Woody and/or Robert Altman.  In the context of the lifeless film that precedes it, the scene is a dramatic flop (although both actors do reasonably well in the scene itself...) OHHHHHHHH... so THAT'S what they were aiming for!  I get it.  Too bad it didn't work.  Anyway, the short version is: skip this film.  It's a waste of time.  Nice set design, though, and strong cinematography 
  I've really enjoyed the other things that I've read by Franzen (The Corrections; How to Be Alone, a book of essays), but I found "The Twenty Seventh City" to be nearly unreadable. The only reason that I persevered to the end was that I was stuck on a 6-hour cross-country flight with nothing else to read. As it was, I wound up skimming the last 100 pages.   Two of the biggest problems with this book are an overabundance of minor characters and a very choppy narrative, in which the average scence is about 1 to 2 pages. It's just jump after jump after jump for 500 pages, with no sustained development of anything. I also found the basic premise (a police colonel and cousin of Indira Ghandi from India comes to the US to take over the police force of St. Louis, where she uses a band of Indian terrorists to manipulate the city's business and political elite and control the real estate market) so implausible that it was just a constant stumbling block all though the book. None of the characters struck me as remotely believable or interesting. I suppose it was intended as some sort of farce, but I don't think I encountered a single thing that I thought was humorous. Then there is the dialect... rather than developing distinctive characters, the author writes in truly awful dialect (eg, a character who says things like "Habout time" or "Hanyway"; and of course, a police officer with a lisp).   Altogether, this may be most excruciating piece of fiction writing I've read in the last 5 years. 
 This is a wonderful item IF or WHEN it works.  It prints the pictures beautifully IF it works.  The trouble is that after using it for a little while (and I mean a little while) It will quit feeding the paper in and the lights start blinking saying that you are out of paper and that you are out of ink.  I have messed with it and messed with it, for some of you who have the same problems sometimes cleaning the feeder roller with rubbing alcohol will get it to work but this doesn't work all the time.  Right now my printer won't work and I cleaned the roller and it is very aggravating as the paper and ink aren't cheap.  I think it is cheaper going down to WalMart and using their instant photo machine.  This is not worth the money or the aggravation!!!! 
 "Compassionate Conservatism" by Olasky is a manifesto for a "bread-and-circus" ideology that grows more transparent by the day. Not surprisingly, it is heavy on rhetoric and light on substance.  The alliterative title is catchy, but "Bible-and-Business Conservatism" is more descriptive 
 The can has to be 100% dent free for this to work.  If you have even a tiny imperfection in the shape of the can, this thing won't open your product.  A great idea, but this needed a little more refinement.  Paper weight in my min 
 Without a doubt the season had some pivotal moments. But too few and far between and without a clear story arc for Sydney. The return of Ms. Lena Olin gave it a shot in the arm, but too little too late. Dull villains and dispensing with the cliffhangers were major mistakes that effectively rendered the show toothless. A relentless snorefest considering the brilliance of previous seasons 
 simple to use, sounds good. but the input wire for the sound breaks only after a couple weeks use in the car. I sent the first one back only to have the replacement do the same thing. You need to use the lighter power supply ans the use of the internal batteries does not do it. I eventually re soldered the wires myself 
 Little or few new bits of info concerning ways to reduce the severity of PMS related symptoms. I don't recommend buying this book without first flipping through it in person to see if it has specific info that you are looking for. 
 Don't waste your money on this book. I will finish the book because it is our book club choice. The characters are shallow and  self centered. The writing is middle school quality. Kris Radish seems to have an agenda she is pushing and she was going to get it all into this book come hell or high water. No poetry and no beauty, I could care less about the women in this book. Who could possibly think life's problems could be solved by walking away from them while drinking lots of wine? I treasure my sisters and women friends but I wouldn't want to be a friend to any of these women. I would give it no stars if I could 
 I had been given a slow cooker a while ago, but could never find good recipes for it.  When I thumbed through this book, the pictures and ingredients looked wonderful, so I bought it.  What a mistake!  These recipes could be made much faster and with the same amount of effort if I didn't even use my slow cooker! If I have to cook everything before I put it in the slow cooker, what exactly is the point? I could cook it using my stove and oven in less time with the same results and effort (something I have successfully tried twice). While the recipes are fairly good in general, this was not at all what I was looking for and to me, it has defeated the purpose of using the slow cooker. 
 I love Daria and this movie was a very fitting sign off for the series. However, for some unknown reason, MTV found reason to make numerous small cuts throughout the movie from the original version as it appeared in its original broadcast. Jokes are deleted, natural conversations between characters are reduced to "just the facts, Ma'am." At least one scene, in which Daria decides not to go on a date with Tom in favor of staying home, was totally cut out of the movie.  ???  The original soundtrack was also replaced with a generic music backdrop to avoid obtaining video distribution rights for the original music.  I recommend buying the DVD if you have no other way to see the broadcast version. I just hope that someday MTV will someday see fit release it uncensored, as well as complete unedited season releases. (Noggin edits episodes for content) 
 I wanted to learn more about Bantam Chickens as I was interested in keeping them as pets in my backyard.  Although the writer gives quite a bit of information, the info given was very discouraging and I gave up the idea after reading the book.  Months later I found a website that gave a more down-to-earth approach that inspired me to try keeping Bantams as pets.  Also, as with many other books on animals, the writer seems to fall back on the many diseases a chicken could possibly contract as a way to fill pages.  If you wrote a book about Humans, you could imagine how many pages could be devoted to disease, rather than more interesting aspects of Humans or their behavior. I'm sorry I bought this book.  
 Having been to Vegas a few times for conventions I have a good idea of what's there and where, but for the most part haven't really had the chance to experience it.  So, knowing that I'm going for a vacation with someone (for the first time) I wanted to get a guide book to help us plan our time there.  This book was really no help at all, even less so since I'd already booked our travel & accomodations (which probably half the book is dedicated to).  Also the breakdown of South Strip/Mid Strip/North Strip was confusing to me.  The entire organization of the book (to me) made it difficult to glean much useful information from, and for the most part they didn't really delve into anything, nor even give a broad overview.  They picked what they liked and talked about it, leaving out most of Vegas, much less most of the strip 
 Oh my, all the terrible reviews for this book are true!!  Ms. Steel is excessively repetitive....I mean EXCESSIVE.  Ms. Steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book...and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over...you get the picture.  I too found myself saying, "Okay, we get it already..."  I also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had.  I don't know the men Ms. Steel knows and hangs out with, but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other, as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them.  Oh please, no man on earth talks that way.  Especially to other men.  This book is completely aweful.  The plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention.  I have read many of Ms. Steel's books and I believe this one is her worst.  I have now started reading Sandra Brown and she is sooo much better.  I recommend "The Alibi."  So far that has been my favorite by her.  She has mystery, suspense, romance...  Her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than Ms. Steels.  To sum it up, I was completely disappointed with the book "Toxic Bachelors."  I highly recommend Sandra Brown, she is a much better author 
 What a beautiful, godly message of self-respect for young women.  The analogy of two identical apples entrusted to two sisters to be kept for the rightful owner should have encouraged girls to resist sex before marriage and guard themselves for the wonderful man that God has for them. Instead it smacks of nighttime drama - sort of like an episode of "Dynasty."    One apple was overexposed, handled and caused to rot due to a careless bite taken by a man for whom the apple was not intended and did not belong.  The other apple was wisely hidden and protected so it stayed fresh and lovely.  With a stunning lack of sensitivity, the sister who is blonde, beautiful, fun-loving, and cheerful, must also be the self-centered, vain fool who lacks good judgement and integrity.  It follows that her apple rots.  As totally expected, the plain sister must have dark hair, be serious by nature and favored by her parents. She has the misfortune of being overlooked and undervalued.  But, stereotypically, her shining character makes up for her lack of beauty and vivaciousness.  Although she lacks charm and confidence, her care of the apple wins her the marriage proposal of the handsome, manly and discerning prince.    She is chosen - not for being attractive in her own right, but for her sterling character.  The blonde, pretty, but unworthy sister flees the scene in tears.  Although full of remorse for her mistakes, she is out of luck.  She is only mentioned again for having the ability to overcome her jealousy of her sister's good fortune.  Why is it necessary to equate beauty with badness and uglyness with goodness?  Why did they have to be sisters?  The contrast only makes God look unjust to both and unforgiving of the "loser."  Why will my daugters never read this book?  You guessed it.  Their looks and personality mirror the sisters in this fairytale.  Does that make one foolish and other wise?  Of course not.  I am tired of the same old yarn about the pretty blonde only being valued for her looks, (because it stands to reason that she stinks inside).  I am even more sickened by the assumption that the "plain" girl is destined to live in the shadow of her sister, fighting despair and hopelessness because her only value is her good heart.    Isn't beauty in the eye of the beholder, anyway?  Why confirm the Hollywood perversion of beauty?  It is detrimental to the self-esteem of both girls.  I will find another way to honor the attributes of my daughters without comparing them to one another.  This story, in effect, illustrates that they are both, for differing reasons, inferior to each other.  In addition they are each, at least partly, undesirable to their future husbands. (Neither one is the whole package - pursued for having godly character and God-given sex appeal.)  I love all of Lisa's novels.  Needless to say, I am furious that I wasted my hopes and money on this one.  This storybook won't even be donated to the library.  I have already slipped into the trash.  Suzann 
 if your looking for something that you can rock to, like KMFDM, PIG, or slick idiot, then STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD! Musically it is way different then what i was hoping for. There is a variety of musical styles on here, non of which is good rockin industrial. So if you don't mind different, buy it, you'll like it, just don't expect much otherwise 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 Barber is painfully boring and his views are over the top liberal.  Read it for school and would not wish reading this on my worst enemy 
 High class porn!! No, really has he every seen a woman that you can use as a floatation device?? 
 i guess dallas and octavio leaving is the best thing that could ever happen to underoath, this was by far the worst underoath c.d. i've ever heard. i'm not sure if it's because it was back when they were younger or because of the difference in members but damn am i glad they've changed. their best c.d. so far is "they're only chasing safety" but "define the great line" is right behind it, not as great but still good. what that guy said about aaron was stupid, it may have upset you that he asked them to leave but he's smart for it. also, he's far from a fruit, he's an AMAZING drummer and great singer. he pretty much makes the band, sure spencer is good but aaron adds a special BAM to it. unlike other crappy christian bands. they have my complete respect 
 I was reading the other reviews and wondered if I was reading the same book.  I even checked the cover to make sure.  Yep, I read the same book but didn't get the same information out of it than other people had.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if all of the other reviews were from Ryan Allis' mother, neighbors, and friends just to boost the book's credibility.  Here's the deal:  I've actually built and sold my company and didn't do it the way Ryan Allis suggested.  Not even close.  Okay, so maybe he has a different method, right?  I just don't see how it's possible to build a company the way he outlines, then to sell it?  I think that he's trying to cover way too much information in this book.  That's the first problem.  The second problem is this:  He tries to "fluff out" the book by adding extraneous information like "globalization" and why there was the "dot bomb crash" in the late 90s.  WHO CARES?  It's like he purposely adds useless information to either make himself seem more intelligent, confuse his readers, mask that he doesn't know what he's talking about or add pages to what would otherwise be a 50-page book.  Another issue I have is that he has his readers do an "opportunity recognition and evaluation" of a company that they would like to start.  Such companies he was able to "brainstorm" are making oxygen tanks so dogs and cats can go diving, flavored straws, sonar for blind people, a teddy bear with sensors and small computer inside that would talk to infants/toddlers and encourage good behavior or tell them a bedtime story (then what are parents for?), restaurants for dogs and cats and a variety of other SUPER LAME business ideas.  I have a lot of business experience under my belt and, if you are considering starting a business, here's my advice:  Don't reinvent the wheel.  Take a concept that someone else is doing very successfully, add your own twist to it, and your product or service through direct response (direct mail, Internet, etc.).  And that's it.  What's with the oxygen tanks for dogs and cats so they can go diving?  Is this guy out of his [CENSORED] mind?  I love my pets too much to subject them to something that would freak them out like underwater diving.  And doesn't he know that cats HATE THE WATER?  This is precisely why I like the book Multiple Streams of Income by Robert Allen so much.  He gives the BEST business ideas with actual step-by-step plans to go with it.  No guessing, reinventing the wheel, inventing some lame-brain product that is destined to fail, and pushing people in the wrong business direction.  If you are thinking of starting a business, don't buy this book.  If you have a business and would like to sell it, don't buy this book.  In fact, I can't think of ANY reason to buy this book 
 I learn from my experience if only a handful of people rated 5 stars don't believe it.  I only read 15% of this book, and it is really really borring. I didn't laugh one bit.  This book say if I am not laughing than I don't have humor.  That's a lame excuse for a boring book.  If this is really 5 stars, I can write a 10 stars book for people to laugh at intelligent and witty jokes, not stupid unlaughable joke like this book.  But, Amazon is way cool, 5 stars bookstore.  I have bought quite a few books (> 50) at Amazon, and I will continue to buy it.  Recommend: I did laugh with for better or for worst by Lynn Johnston.  Clean and witty whole some family jokes.  Judy Carter is also very funny.  These two ladies are way cool  
 Being a long-time Nancy Drew collector, I really looked forward to reading this book, but I found it to be very disappointing. I've read a lot of the 'tart-noir' wacky-gal mystery series, and this book seems to have all the standards - sexy, ditzy gal who just can't seem to get it all together, hunky boyfriend, obsession with glamorous flashy clothes, the need to keep secrets from the police, and on and on. But Cece Caruso just doesn't come off with any realism to me. She's too over-the-top, and she's not even a good detective. By her own admission, over and over throughout the book, she keeps missing the point, and the clues, and everything else that would lead her to understand what's going on and solving the mystery.  Cece is a biographer of mystery writers and in this book she is writing a book about Carolyn Keene, the author of the Nancy Drew books who was and still is a group of ghostwriters. There is a lot of Nancy Drew collecting info in this story that was, for the most, taken from some speculative fan-made guides, honored by some collectors as The Truth but frowned upon as hypothetical by the rest of the bibliographic world. It also seems the author made up some of her own. Her depiction of Nancy Drew collectors at their annual convention in Palm Springs is really unflattering. Believe me, they are not the strange, nerdy, boring people she makes them out to be. For some reason she found it necessary to compare their boring get-together with a wild swinging convention of golf-fan lesbians at the same hotel.  It's disappointing that the first major piece of fiction published about Nancy Drew collecting and Nancy Drew collectors is such a mediocre book that plods along for the most going this way and that in directions that lead nowhere or that Cece just doesn't 'get'. Her obsessions with vintage clothes, gourmet foods, alcoholic beverages, art, and on-again-off-again boyfriend are all pretty interesting, but she and her gang need more characterization, and need to be a little less fabulous-in-every-way to be believable.  Nancy Drew fans who read this book will probably be disappointed. It's less about Nancy and more about Cece and friends and how 'hot' and 'cool' and too-fabulous-to-be-true they are. Let's hope the next author who takes on the Nancy Drew mystique will give it a more interesting treatment 
 This is the poorest book to come out of Addison-Wesley Pub Co.  It is simply not usable and a waste 
 Had to stop about 1/4 of the way through it and give it away 
 "Touring is an emotional rollercoaster"...wow guys, tell me something that Steve Perry didn't cover about twenty years ago when Journey did their own 'my life on the road is hard", video. blah blah blah. If you're looking for new ideas or insights you aren't going to find them here. If you are looking for any visual stimulation besides the "random town through window" b-roll, good luck. I admit, I love their music and, in print, Deathcab interviews well...but this little filmstrip fails to capture either very well. Which probably is less of a critique on the band than the film-maker/editor. (Who knows what a better cutter might have come up with.) On the PRO side, they did shoot it all in 16mm and some of the extras (the Lightness demo in particular) are excellent. Buy their music?  YES, see them live?  - YES. Buy this DVD? Only if you want something to half-watch while your doing your taxes. 
 I remember this movie being really, really fun and great when I was 9. My wife wanted this for our video collection and I hate myself for buying this movie. All I need to know is why she wanted this today! If you have kids, which we do, they'll enjoy this for the first time, but after words they'll be as bored with it as I am. If you are looking for nostalgia, this is the movie, but if you are looking for a good dust collector, buy it quickly 
 The discoveries made by the COBE satellite were truly astounding: the microwave background has a blackbody spectrum, the diffuse IR background, and the fluctuations in the radiation temperature (the 'wrinkles'). Unfortunately, the author spends too much of the time making it out as if he really made the discovery and leaving out how it was actually made by the whole science team. Furthermore, there is no mention of how he ignored the disclosure rules of his groups and held a self-aggrandizing press conference before the official announcement of the measurements.  For a much better accounting of this historic experiment, read the book by John Mather, the other recipient of the Nobel for COBE 
 I wasn't expecting this book to somehow transform my sex life, but I certainly didn't expect the garbage I read. Yes, he makes some preaty good, but obvious observations. For example, "...when a man looks [at another woman], he needs to look appropriately." Or that a woman like to hear she's beautiful.  This is definitely a man writing  to an audince of women. There is some good advice here, but you have to be able to distinguish it from the nonsense. 
 This book is terrible.  RaH takes a perfectly good murder mystery and turns in into...well, I don't quite know what.  Halfway through the book, it seems as though he had set it down for several years, came back to it to finish it off, but had nothing but nonsense on the brain.  I've seen authors pull an ending out of their hat before, but this book absolutely takes the cake.  It's not even my book and I threw it in the trash so it won't waste another person's time ever again 
 This particular model is simply unsuitable for use, as the girth of this glass is too large to hold securely. Although impressive visually, the execution of this glass is poor as it is impractical for use safely and comfortably. As an owner of many of the Sommeliers series glasses from Riedel, the "O" Chardonnay glass is a blatant disappointment. This selection will be returned to the seller 
 Way too thin for the experienced traveller or collector of offbeat destinations. Liked the old photo postcards but there were no photos of the places that were described.  So photos did not match text.  I think that people who are really into this kind of attraction are sort of graduate level tourists/travellers/pilgrims and this is kindergarten level 
 The photo is decrptive. The photo makes it look wider than it is.  As no dimensions are listed, I was fooled by the photo. It's only about 11" wide.  The screws putting it together are difficult to screw in straight, due to poorly constructed parts.  You'd do as well putting an old book, or two, under your monitor; which is what I do with worthless old computer books, like books on Windows 98 
 Would you stand in line at an Applebee's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good---maybe better---at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes?  Of course not!  Why, then, would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two James Patterson books, or a Patterson and a Connelly, or two Thomas Harris books...my apologies, Greg Iles, but for a simple, formulaic serial killer book, Blood Memory was just WAY too long.  The book has two co-plots; one involves a serial killer who murders older men, the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead.  The serial killer plot is actually the more interesting, but at least two-thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the "secret" is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book.  All in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if Iles---or his editor---had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text.  Iles just LOVES to have two characters sit and talk for 3o, 40 or even 50 pages, but since most of his dialogue is what I call "soap opera" speak, meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths, these chapters dragged on and on and on.  Iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream, taking showers, and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely.  Come on, Greg; why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it's some strange, exotic treat that no one's ever heard of before?  Just as some people love to hear themselves talk, I think Iles loves to see himself write...and although some of his books have been quite good, Blood Memory misses the mark by a long shot

 I was intrigued with the title, but understood nothing of the lyrics.  As most of rap (hip hop) this is incredible garbage.  only my opinion of course.  
 These were purchased for my Grandson for Christmas. They are hard to get on. Clumsy and don't have the effect they would have you believe. He never really used them and  a waste of money. They were useless and also very dangerous.  Defintely would not recommend. 
 Ok, a John Woo film, starring Chow Yun Fat, about an art heist.  It's all good right?  Wrong.  Oh, was it bad.  Slapstick, some terribly contrived stunts and a cringingly bad soundtrack.  We did finish it--but we still wonder why 
 This book is absolutely wonderful, it should be required reading for every lawn fanatic out there. An ecological viewpoint presented in an easy to understand and engrossing style. I would recommend this book to everyone. I am giving copies of this book as presents and loaning my copy to friends. This would be the perfect book to donate to your local or school library 
 I greatly enjoyed some of Varley's later work, so I decided to back up and try this series.  I am relieved I only bought the first book.  Its shallow characters and predictable plotline left me unwilling to read very far in it.  Worse, to my unpleasant surprise, it has line drawing illustrations clearly aimed at the fantasy life of adolescent males - don't read this in an airport where a child and her outraged mother might catch a glimpse of the illustrations.  Sorry I bought it but I give it 2 stars rather than 1 because there is at least some effort at a plot 
 This is the sad story of a divorce and it's aftermath. Jeff Daniels plays another jerk who turns his sons against their mother while seducing one of his female college students. He's the stereotypical egomaniac former successful writer who turns ruthless and hostile after his wife also becomes a successful writer. He can't handle the competition and it turns his madonna/whore complex on high gear. He even fights over custody of the family pet!   If your parents are divorced this may bring back some painful repressed memories. Sadly it's the story of my generation. People with kids should watch this before divorcing. The worst part is the confustion of the boys and the distortion of the facts by their father. 
 This is not a greatest hits album, although based on other reviewers this collection embraces Sheena Easton's hard to find early b-sides and some rarities, so the proper name should be rarities and b-sides by Sheena Easton, "but" Gold Collection, is fair for a Sheena Easton fan, but if you want a Greatest Hits, The World Of Sheena Easton The Singles Collection would do you good, as for the songs included here, they sound awfully like demos, but if you're truly Easton's fan you definitely enjoy this! 
 The premise of the story caught my attention -- a man presumed dead for years, whose wife had already collected a large insurance policy on him, appears to be alive after all.  The problem is that Sue Grafton's fictional detective Kinsey Millhone is too incompetent to solve the case.  How does she resolve her dilemma?  By asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy Ms. Milhone's curiosity.  Lame!   And then there is this subplot into Ms. Millhone's personal life that leads to nowhere.  I don't know what "K" or the rest of the alphabet has in store for readers, but I'm not interested in finding out 
 I work as an editor on high-end projects (mostly commercials and music video's with a couple of well regarded concert DVD's and award winning short film work to my credit) and I have to say that the editing on this disc (and the previous 2, to a lesser extent) demonstrates a real lack of sensitivity to the material.  There is an epic quality to U2 in concert. Each song is its own experience... its own mini event; and instead of letting the power of that experience unfold naturally and organically... letting the music/performance tell its own story (and what a story it is!) the editing imposes itself on the music and the performance(s) and the effect is that you are taken out of (or at least not fully drawn into) the marvelous natural flow of power that is U2 live.  All 3 of these DVD's are worth having simply because the band's brilliance in concert mostly transcends the poor editing but these discs COULD have been truly amazing documentations of almost religious experiences had the director/editor gotten out of their own way and really understood and felt into the event(s).  What a shame 
 I'm a fan of Dave Barry, I enjoy his column, I enjoyed some of his books in the past, and I bought this one with great anticipation. Boy was I disappointed! The story is meaningless, the characters are not interesting, the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny.  Do yourself a favor, do not read this book! I can't believe anyone recommends it 
 This is not the book.  All you will get is a bunch of worksheets and crossword puzzles that go with the book titled "Structure and Function of the Body".  
 I bought the book thinking it would be a practical introduction on how to apply CMMI to your company hence I was very disappointed to find out the authors have limited themselves only to summarize the CMMI models. Few real explication is given about concepts within the CMMI models, neither any real life experience is shared that could help you implement CMMI 
 I have used this _RW with my Sanyo DVD recorder. The result is that I cound not play the recording. It wil freeze up. and some times they can not be formatted. They will not function well if they are used for the VR mode. I have used other brands such as TDK or Fuji. they are OK. 
 I bought this album on pure speculation it was an Amazon recommondation and was uncharted waters for me. Owning around 200 blues albums with close to 100 of them being lps. I had never listened to either of these guys. Read the reviews and seemed like it would be a good venture. Received my cd figuring it would be like most blues albums and would take several listens before it would start throwing its arms around me. Wrong! This is one of the few albums I own that nails you right out of the box! It has been in my car stereo for around a month now and shows no indication of getting old.The first three tracks are non stop adrenalin guitar work with number three at just over 15 minutes just being a total piece of work. Smooth like a well aged whiskey. The final track with guest singer is one of the more haunting blues pieces I've ever heard. It's one of the few pieces I know that actually brings you to the edge of reverse blues and makes you feel bad this track is also in the 15 minute time slot too. All and all you can just let this cd run and it becomes nice back gound music to what ever it is you are doing. All in the way classical music does. I'd be surpised if any one really listening to this could give a bad rap! This is a real guitar players record 
 My Dell Laptop D600 running Windows XP, didn't recognize the device when I plugged it into either USB port.  I contacted Targus support and they stated that it should have worked and that I should try it on another PC.  If it doesn't work on this laptop, I have no use for it.  There is no CD ROM for support drivers and Targus support stated that I shouldn't need any drivers.  Went to Microsoft website for compatibility and the device wasn't listed.  I should have researched this before the purchase.  I would not recommend anyone purchasing it. 
 This book is badly dated.  Worse it shows configs for new to Linux administrators and leaves the harder configurations missing time after time. No SELinux just cron, SSH, password and file permissions utilities.  Fortunately I brought both the Linux Troubleshooting Bible and the Network Security Bible.  I recommend both for those starting Linux security administration.   (...) Center for Internet Security  Valdez Ladd CCNA, CIW-SP, CCSA, CWNA, I-NET 
 Rainbow fish has colorful shiny scales.  He is shamed into giving them to everyone.  Sounds like a communist primer 
 It's amazing how Hollywood and the publishing industry have bent their knees to Secession mythology, from Birth of a Nation to the present example of melodramatic falsification. This is a very dull, shapeless, stilted movie. I wouldn't bother to denounce it on artistic grounds, but since it is above all a piece of propaganda, I'm compelled to condemn it as history. What it presents is the "War between the States" version of the Civil War, in which the gallant Southerners defend their homes,their beloved hills and dales, their cultured lives from the inexplicable invasion of the rude hordes of the North. There are only two Black characters, both sentimentally loyal to their Southernness and their masters; otherwise, slavery is beside the point. The generalship of Lee and Jackson, of course, is idolized, while the Northern officers above the rank of colonel are portrayed as fools. The battle scenes are perfectly predictable; guys charge on foot, other guys shoot, the fields are littered with bodies. Wouldn't a little exposition of the logistics of those battle been more interesting? How real is it to show only one train, and that Southern, in a war won more by transportation than by musketry? If you are a believer in the myth of the Lost Cause and the justice of Secession, if you have ever cottoned to the notion that the War wasn't really about slavery, then I challenge you honor! I defy you to read just one heavy, scholarly book, Arguing About Slavery by William Lee Miller, a professor at the University of Virginia. It retells the debates that occurred in the House of Representatives, over slavery, in the 1830s, twenty-five years before the election of Lincoln. The uncompromising sectional hatred expressed in those debates will surely convince you that the Civil War had deeper roots than you thought, and that slavery Was indeed the central issue for both sides, Blue and Grey 
 Loser by Jerry Spinelli could have been an interesting and overall good book but, in my opinion it was not because it was rushed and undeveloped.  The book chronicles the life of Donald Zinkoff from his first day of kindergarten to his last day of eighth grade in a mere two hundred pages.  Thus no grade is well developed and neither is any character but the loveable loser and main character Donald Zinkoff.  This book was attempting to give a good message about the life through school of a loser.  Because it is hard to go through your time in school with out true friends or any real interests to speak of let alone to be unatheletic on top of it.  But although the message was no doubt an outstanding one, it left much to be desired as a whole 
 Bert Dodsen has a few decent tips for artists who are trying to teach themselves Drawing; but he seems to have ignored his own hints in his first paragraph of his Introduction ~ in trying to describe the sorting out mixed information.  Bert recalls an old Danny Kaye movie, a western, where Cowboy Danny gets mixed instructions from various bystanders while watching him enter a Comedy Gunfight. "The sun's in the west, so keep him in the east..." ~ Despite Danny being the master of these critical last-minute toungtwisters, and that he employed them in several of his movies - Danny never made a Cowboy Western movie! ~ Actually, author, Bert Dodsen probably recalled Bob Hope in "Alias Jesse James" (1959), where Bob did the exact routine credited Danny Kay in Bert's Introduction.  I'd like to add my HINT ~ "Bert, Research before you write...&quot 
 This book should have been a collection of short stories.  It needs some heavy editing.  There are moments of real science fiction and story telling, but it is burdened by preaching.  
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 and I think it might be banned from the public libraries where children might get a hold of it.  How a man who rarely goes to Church, started a preemptive war, and cuts funding for programs for the weakest and poorest among us has ever gotten the reputation for being a "good Christian" is one of the greatest mysteries of the milennium. Maybe it is because he said God "talks to him" and told him to start the Iraq war? Regardless, this book is either an awesome satire on the false piety of our president, or is the most obvious piece of propaganda nonsense around.  You decide - but don't look for it in your public library, because it may have been banned. 
 I saw a bit of an interview with the author on Book TV and got this. I really WANTED to like this book. The (stated) premise of the book is strong, and bringing Epaminondas's exploits to a wide audience seemed pretty interesting to me.  My problem was that right from the get-go it seemed to me the author had a pretty weird tendency to draw political parallels between ancient Greece and today which just aren't appropriate or realistic. They weren't key to what he was trying to say, either, so I probably could have soldiered through the book. I put it down, though, since it was distracting trying to figure out where he was really coming from.   I admit that his dismissiveness toward Alexander and Grant seemed borderline childish to me, the way it was written. Perhaps that also made it hard for me to take the good parts of the book seriously 
 me and my partner are both real open minded people who enjoy a huge range of films. And we do really like The Thin Red Line. But this was a real boring piece of film making.....The whole film was just one huge poetry reading and I prefer to read poetry from a book.....It just doesn't goe anywhere and we found the love scenes even worse than those directed by George Lucas.Even the battle scenes were just poetry readings..........Watch Thin Red Line instead if you are interested in this director's work...That film is a masterpiece....This isn't 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 What was an exciting adventure novel back in the 1970's for a young pre-teen (was I ever so young?) on re-reading now turns out to be a silly James Bond knock-off/Summer beach book. The most grating conceit is the author's habit of giving every *single* female charactor a "clever" name (Anna Bidet - French, Randi Knickers-English, Jemima Brown-African American, etc...). It hasn't aged well 
 my other management textbooks were able to cover nearly the same amount of information in 1/4 the space without being needlessly complex or as paralizingly boring. it would be an excellent cure for insomnia. professors PLEASE don't make anyone buy this thing. 
 Expect no sparkle from stars or script in this remake of the witty comedy classic, which has been repeatedly filmed with varying degrees of success since 1931.  There is no chemistry between the male leads, and Burnette is  unspeakably bad in her cameo appearance.  Recommendation: see instead  "His Girl Friday," starring Rosalind Russel and Cary Grant; it is  easily the finest screen version of the famous stage play 
 I'm not really sure why a writer would make the decision to write a book on someone whose films he didn't particularly care for. It starts off quite well with an interesting look at Depp's family history but then takes a downward turn.  Each film Johnny has appeared in since the start of his career is criticized one at a time (except for perhaps Blow in which the author manages to scrounge up a positive thought or two-WOW). Not to mention that there are glaring typos and random errors that any well versed Depp fan/historian would pick up in a heartbeat (The Arizona Dream 12 minute wedding sequence was not Paul's, it was Axel's for goodness sake!)   And what is this illusion that the author speaks of? Why, it's the idea that perhaps Depp and his agent Tracey Jacobs have managed to fool us all by marketing his personality in order to make him who he is today. Funny, and here I thought his success might have something to do with his gift for transforming into the various characters he has played over the years. But what do I know. I'm just a brainless fan. And this book is definitely not fan friendly.  In conclusion, this book is more suitable for someone who wishes to learn the "fine art" of becoming a film critic. I'm sorry I didn't know all this beforehand 
 What the hell is it about summer and a corny movie about dancing that involves some dude who totally doesn't fit in. but threw his dancing abilities he shows everyone they're wrong about him.  Every summer we have one of these "feel good" movies that involves a ton of dancing.  The soundtrack is what I'm revewing though, where do I begin? Oh, I know, how about most of these songs don't go together.  We've reached a point where "Now that's Pop" cd's are huge sellers.  I'm not saying these songs are bad (some are, some aren't) but most don't really fit.  Random good songs make for a pretty bad soundtrack.  There is no flow here, it's too all over the place for me.  The Sean Paul & Keyisha Kole song is pretty smooth, as are a few others.  As a soundtrack it doesn't work though 
 Before I started reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.  Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In "Zen" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s. But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.  The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17:      "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower."  That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of "quality."   I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.   Whatever the book was supposed to be, it didn't impressed me.  
 I am absolutely stunned by the number of five-star reviews of this albums.  Is there really so little quality singing out there that people can be swayed by the likes of JoJo?  I mean, really, is there anything to JoJo, aside from her age, that you can't find in Kelly Clarkson, Joss Stone, or Christina Aguilera?  It's easy to imagine more interesting artists, like Clarkson or Stone, on I-love-myself declarations like "Coming for You."  An older artist could certainly make lines like "Come with me, stay the night/say the words, but boy/it don't feel right" and "I was young and in love..." less eye-rolling; this girl is 15, exactly how much romantic wisdom does she have?  In fact, it's difficult for me, a person who knows little about JoJo beyond this album, to tell how talented the young singer actually is, since the vocals - particularly on "Too Little Too Late" - are covered with more layers of production than your average Britney Spears single.  This is normal in the music industry today, of course; it doesn't necessarily mean JoJo is a poor singer, and it doesn't make her songs any less addictive, but it's hard for an adult or savvy teen to ignore the amount of electronic tweaking present on this album.    Maybe JoJo should try doing an MTV Unplugged concert (do those still exist?) to see if she's worth all the hype; I suspect she isn't 
 Bought for my wife and it is usless. Short battery life and poor suction. A total waste of money 
 For that matter it can be written for any party candidate that wants the truth of his/her dirty secrets covered up. I feel that it's the most insulting film to be released. It hides the fact that we as citizens, and our government don't really care about who we stick in office. If the party lines up with what we believe in screw the fact he had to cover something up. I can't fathom why we continue to fall for this all the time, and believe me I don't feel it's right to air it all over the news either. I feel that it comes down to the man, and if he does have the values his/her party believes in then he will do the honorable thing, and own up to his/her mistake. This movie is just another nail to drive into the justification that it's alright to cover things up, and there are no absolutes, or rights or wrongs. Wht happens when we tick off the wrong person who's rich? Do we wait until then to change the moral? That's Pathetic, and so is this movie 
 Regrettably one of the more unreadable tomes about Wall Street, "Every Man A Speculator" comes up as dry as a professor's rambling essay, as unyielding as a sermon, but with relevance much harder to discern.  The book is laden with--one might say overly reliant upon--quotes and convoluted, often pedantic sentence structures.  It is admittedly informative at turns, at times socially insightful, but with no joy in its reading.  It compels as a reference manual would, but that's not why we read. 
 I had very high hopes for this book, but they were all dashed. The first two chapters Introdution and Architectural Styles were a good overview of Software Architecture in general and some of the major architectural styles  such as "pipe and filter" which is used in systems such as  Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 DTS.  Although it was great to read about the  different styles, they were treated trivially--not in-depth.  The rest of  the book has very basic case studies that may be good for a Software  Architecture 101 course in junior college--not Carnegie Mellon. I would  have loved to have found some more "real world" case studies with  UML (which this book does not address) 
 I just got this figure in the mail and I have to say that it is really nice looking. I have it up on my mantle now and it looks a=even better out of it's packaging. It is a must have for Kings, Gretzky, and NHL fans. Id rate the pose a 10 out of 10, it was from when he got the points record in Edmonton. This figure would get 5 stars if it wasn't for the assembly. You have to put Wayne's legs on and normally the leg assembly is easy but thios was just horrific. It is possible, but I had to use tons of soap and water just to get the legs in, and then it wasn't easy. But I think that it is definately worth it. 
 This book is absolutely painful to read.  If you have to purchase this book for class, be prepared for chapter 7, 10, & 11.  These are the most painful chapters in the book.  In these chapters it is very hard to follow the text (i.e. main points).  Other students and I got migranes from trying to prepare notes for these chapters for a test.  Just horrible 
 I have always wondered about Professor Chomsky's writings. He has always been described as mean-spirited and anti-American by the right. I finally got an opportunity to read his book Hegemony or Survival. I was surprised at how readable it was; I expected it to be overly verbose. I was also surprised that I actually agreed with some of what he had to say, particularly about Iraq. He certainly is correct that the US led invasion of Iraq was a fantastic opportunity for Bin Ladin to stir up anti-US sentiment and attract members to his terrorist organization. I don't think you have to be a professor to see that though. Although some have charged Chomsky with being sympathetic to terrorists, I failed to see this. He condemns terrorism but accuses the US of creating an atmosphere that is conducive to the growth of terrorist organizations.  He argues here that US foreign policy victimizes every country it interferes with. The US consistently brutally punishes any country whose actions are contrary to its agenda, even if that country is just trying to better itself. Without a doubt, the US has made some disastrous foreign policy decisions but I don't think Washington is as evil as Chomsky wants the reader to believe.   We Americans like to believe that the US is always the good guy riding in to save the day. Sadly, all too often US intervention harms the very people we believe to be helping. Having said that, the US is not the evil monster that Chomsky portrays it either. He asserts that the US has only one goal and that is global dominance and it is all done under the guise of fighting terrorism or fighting communism. Too often he appears to use fuzzy logic or cherry picks events so that he can apply this contention to various skirmishes the US has been involved in.   On page 9 he states "In one country, Nicaragua, Washington had lost control of the armed forces that had traditionally subdued the region's population" "The us-backed Somoza dictatorship was overthrown by the Sandinista rebels, and the murderous national guard was dismantled. Therefore Nicaragua had to be subjected campaign of international terrorism that left the country in ruins" "The spirit of exuberance, vitality , and optimism that followed the overthrow of the dictatorship could not long survive as the reigning superpower intended to dash the hopes that a grim history might finally take a different course"   What Chomsky chooses to ignore is that after the Sandinistas overthrew Somoza with the full support of the US government, US then made initial efforts to establish peaceful relations with the Sandinistas. Congress authorized 75 million dollars in aid and offered to send doctors, nurses and teachers to help stabilize the new government. The Sandinistas got into trouble not by ousting Somoza as Chomsky wishes the reader to believe, but by supporting the Marxist guerrillas in El Salvador. The US cut off aid and gave repeated warnings to stop providing support to the communist rebels. In 1981 the US even sent Thomas Enders to try to end the tension. He offered them a sweet deal, the US would completely leave them alone to do as they please if they would just stay out of the conflict in El Salvador. They refused. This is was the beginning of the end for the Sandinistas.   I don't understand why Chomsky implies that Nicaragua was on the course to some utopia either. The Sandinistas promised their supporters free elections but refused once in power. They consistently denied Nicaraguans the freedoms they had promised, newspapers were censored, religions suppressed. Some ethnic groups were terrorized and their villages destroyed. The only reason that I can think of that Chomsky would paint such a distorted view of the Sandinistas is so that he can lead the reader to a false conclusion.  Later Chomsky implies that the US ruined the healthy economy of Nicaragua. Any economic growth that the Nicaraguans experienced was due to the US because of the said aid and the efforts of the US to have their World Bank debts forgiven.  Chomsky wants the reader to believe that US conflicts are never about communism or terrorism, that its just a ruse. He's wrong, nicaragua is just one example of where he got it wrong.  I also wonder about his comments concerning Cuba appealing to the UN for help. Chomsky states that Cuba didn't respond to the US with violent attacks within the US, rather they followed the procedure required by international law. Chomsky appears to be implying that the noble Cubans were above the primitive barbarity of the US. Obviously they didn't attack the US because they did not have the means to launch a formidable attack. Keep in mind that after the Cuban missile crisis, Che Guevara, one of the most influential leaders in the Castro Regime was furious. He was angered that the Soviets were weak and pulled the missiles out and proudly announced that he would have launched them all given the opportunity.  Chomsky's claims that Cuba's economic woes are purely a product of the US embargo seem to be a bit of a stretch. Did the embargo negatively impact Cuba? Of course. So much so that their island is the now the equivalent of tropical slum despite the fact that every other country in the free world will trade with them and they get billions of dollars in aid? I fail to see how.  I am troubled at his comparison of the 911 attacks and Clinton Admins attack on the pharmaceutical company in Sudan. Why didn't Chomsky mention that it was in response to attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania? Why didn't Chomsky mention that we believed it to be a chemical weapons plant? Why didn't Chomsky mention that the US released 24 million dollars to the businessman whose factory we wrongfully attacked?  I have numerous other concerns about the authors claims but I've reached my word limit here at amazon.  Cheer 
 My blood was boiling as I read other customers' rave reviews of "The Prince of Tides."  Whoever considers this thesaurus-scrubbing, self-indulgent mess of cliches a literary masterpiece has no sense of language and literature.  Someone was even audacious enough to compare Pat Conroy to Virginia Woolf.  What a joke!  Woolf's writing is brilliant, original, and real.  She cuts to the quick, whereas Conroy slathers his story in cloying metaphors and trite descriptions.  One can almost see Conroy congratulating himself on each simile and metaphor as he writes, not caring how superfluous or artificial his language is -- nor how unrealistic it makes the story.  I laughed out loud at some of the words he puts in the characters' mouths.  In the real world, nobody is as self-concious and self-reflexive as the characters in this book.  They do not speak in reams of figurative language.  I cannot even get into how inconsistent and impossible the characters are, especially the children.  Also, Conroy caricatures both places and exaggerates the cultural gulf between them.  (I make that claim as a Southerner who lived in NYC for four years.)  It's one of many, many flaws in this ridiculous book.  Read it if you like sensational stories with mass appeal (John Irving, etc.), but avoid it if you have any respect for the English language and for real American literature (Cheever, Plath, Hemingway, Cather, etc.).  Don't be fooled by all the fools out there.  
 Too bad there isn't a 0 star rating. This was simply awful.  I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years - waded though a lot of her semi-readable stuff - waiting for another decent installment.  But I give up.  No more Kaye Scarpetta for me.  This book cured me - for good 
 This doll highchair is junk. It has been put together less than 24 hours and had one dolly in it and it is no longer useable. The tray has fallen off from both sides. The seat fabric is just that a piece of fabric stapled on and it looks tacky, but never mind that the lace trim is shredding into shambles. It has come unsewn. It was only six inches of sewing and that couldn't last. I did give it two stars for education value. I have learned that I probably won't purchase this brand of doll toys. I tried to get my daughter and each grand daughter a different kind of series of dolly thing but I think I will stick with Zapf brand and some will just have duplicates. My poor grand daughter got the short end of the stick her birthday present was a flop. Sheril 
     While I applaud Ms. Lawrence for educating fans on the gross injustices within the Hendrix family and for having a commendable understanding of Janie Hendrix's psychological make up that is lost even on many who are within her orbit, there are some very serious credibility problems here.       While even the idle Hendrix fan knows Jimi was born in King County Hospital, (Now Harbor View) Lawrence states he was born at the home of a family friend.(Ouch) Jimi is quoted allegedly verbatum throughout the book but from some alledged tapes of interviews that no one has seen or heard and that Lawrence conveniently plans on destroying so 'no one can profit from them'.Meanwhile cigarette packs (yes, cigarette packs) and necklaces are being sold via ebay or to private collectors allegedly having belonged to Hendrix ,siting Ms. Lawrence as the previous owner and source of authenticity.      At one point she aledgedly quotes Hendrix as saying:  "The LSD passed around San Francisco was a fabulous discovery for me, I'd taken acid in London but...."        Aside from Jimi's use of the word 'fabulous' being at best incredulous, the fact that Hendrix had already tried LSD in New York in 1996 before going to England and subsequently Monterey is common knowledge among afficianados and again makes all of these alledged direct quotes questionable. Those of you who have listened to and read the hundreds of hours of interviews available through collectors, official releases and press clippings will also find some of the wording of these alledged quotes that the book, and the credibility of it's author are based on, extremely suspect. At one point Ms. Lawrence even offers an aledged quote from Hendrix's mother who passed away in 1958:  "Jimi baby" she told her son "I have to escape this"     While quotes like this can illicit an emotional response   from the average reader,they are clearly  fictional. Throughout the book people close to Jimi are referenced but very sparsely quoted, if at all. I shared the recount of Jimi's trip to Berkeley as a small child (Pg.5) with Jimi's aunt Delores and she laughed openly and wondered aloud where people come up with these stories. This from a woman who was actually there and involved in planning said trip. While making a reference to Ernestine Benson and misstakenly referring to her husband Cornel  as "Bill" , Lawrence again allegedly quotes Hendrix in lieu of an actual interview with the Benson's who are both still living and have incredible first hand insights having lived with the Hendrix's.     Lawrence's assertion that Hendrix committed suicide simply because his journal was left out is no less ridiculous than Jimi's adopted stepsister Janie's claim that Jimi didn't OD.  Lawrence then stops just short of gleefully giving herself credit for Monika's suicide, but the jist is clear. This book is more than a bit narcissistic with Lawrence lauding herself as much as she does her subject. While proclaiming herself to be a close confident of Hendrix' the general consensus is that she wasn't around that much, if people even know who she is at all.    For a much more well researched and credible look into Jimi's life read Electric Gypsy or even more so , the new book Room Full Of Mirrors by Charles Cross. The Man, The Magic, The Truth, while very dramatic, is rife with glaring inaccuracies and is for the most part a novel about the author and her subject, not a biography or a reliable historical record. Unless these alledged tapes that are widely quoted throughout the entire book are made available, their legitimacy and the legitimacy of the book will forever be questioned.

 And that's pretty much all this book does. And truly I'd be okay with that if it were at all well written or offered ANY real insight into his method. Y'know how reality shows always spend like one-third of their air time repeating stuff they already told you? This book is like that.   The King of Virgin is clearly a marketing genius. Surely there's another book that does him justice 
 Mississippi and Sugar Baby are great songs, up there with the best Dylan has done. However, the rest of the album, while listenable, isn't all that memorable. Still, I suppose it's amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still, after over 40 years performing and recording. The same cannot be said for '60s peers like Paul McCartney or the Stones. Overall, Time Out of Mind was better, although that too was a little overrated, with only Not Dark Yet, Standing in the Doorway and Trying to Get to Heaven truly belonging to the canon of great Bob songs.  
 This is a book about our society and yet I am left wondering how "everything bad for us" actually affects our society. I believe the author's underlying presumption is that improving the individual improves our society as a whole. This societal analysis, however, is completely missing.  The book can be summed up as follows: 1. Games and software are more complex, therefore our problem-solving ability has increased. 2. TV is more complex, therefore our emotional intelligence has increased. 3. The Internet gives us new ways to connect with others, therefore our communication abilities have increased.  The litmus test for all this is increasing IQ scores.  Part I of the book goes to great lengths to explain how an individual's "mental muscle" is increased through popular media: games, TV, software, and the Internet. Part II asserts that increased IQ scores are the proof that our mental muscle is increasing.  The individual may be benefiting from popular media, but is our society benefiting? Are more technological breakthroughs happening? Are we better able to piece together disparate facts provided by the media and government into a cohesive whole? Is software easier to use so we can more easily accomplish our goals? Are communities and homes being designed better so they improve communication between neighbors and families? Can we better recognize the underlying motives of our politicians? Are we making great strides to decrease global warming, air and water pollution, forest depletion, species extinction, famine, homelessness, cancer and disease, gender and racial inequality, and the distribution of wealth?  If our ability to see connections and solve problems has improved, why do a vast number of Americans still believe there is a connection between 911 and Iraq? Why do we not recognize that the diversity of plant and animal species on the planet directly affects our well-being? Why do we seem incapable of understanding that many of the divisive issues we focus upon (e.g., school prayer, flag burning, abortion, gay marriage) are simply manifestations of larger societal problems (e.g., inequality, poverty, domination and control).  How is the popular media affecting these societal and technological issues? Is it making them worse? This is the missing part of the book that I hope will be addressed in another edition 
 Black Betty!  What a horrible performance.  Can anyone even understand a word they are saying?  Not me!  I'll give it one star for the laugh I got out of listening to it.  This can't possibly be considered good music, because I've got one word...CRAP 
 I kinda had high hopes for this one. Just cuz I was expecting a genuine good movie rather than a flick with a holographic cover I got at blockbuster for a few horror laughs. I mean, the freakin guy from the show 2gether is in it. Anyway, horrible acting and what pissed me off is the direct ripoff of HO1KC. Shes a hitchhiker, wearing about the same thing as Baby, and is talking crazy, and even says 'I love this song' and starts dancing. Anway, the plot has about one sentence 'get stuck in the ride and walk around never really searching for a way out' thats about an hour of the movie right there. Honestly nothing happens. GREAT gore though I must say. and cute little plot twist at the end. Don't buy this though, borrow from a frien 
 Interesting how Netanyahu already had "terrorism" on his mind while his buddies from Israel in the PNAC think tank were righting that the foreign policy they wanted to pursue in the Middle East (ie ethnic cleansing of all Arabs) would not be possible without "a catalyzing event like a 'new pearl harbor.') Man did that prediction come true! What insight these Zionist warmongers have! Oh and don't worry about the 5 Mossad operatives who were caught high-fiving each other while filming 9/11 as it happened who were dressed as Arabs, failed a lie detector & whose van tested positive for bombs. And nevermind the fact that Netanyahu said that it would be "very good for Israel" immediately after 9/11. (This is sarcasm, you should be concerned about this and look into all of it and more.) The towers were brought down with explosives. Read this book only to know your enemy, these guys had a plan for us and we're in the midst of it today it's called total destruction. All for Zionism, all for the Jewish state. Our government listed to Netanyahu & his friends alright, they listened all too well 
 The book should have been titled a less grandiose, "Determinate factors in success and failure over a wide range of economic studies."  Okay, I wouldn't have bought the book then, but if I did, I wouldn't have felt cheated.  Did he write these essays first, put the title on last, write the book with title in mind and simply get bored with the subject?  Who knows.  Although well-written, the book lacks focus and passion.  
 ...just a note. Peggy Guggenheim's collection of modern art does still reside in Venice contrary to what the review on this site states 
 Not only is the book poorly written, laced with mundane cliches and terribly unoriginal, but it reflects poorly on young Chinese writers as well! It is disgusting how much hype and attention is giving to "literature" that reads like inarticulate teenage-girl blogs.  Shame on everyone involved in publishing this garbage 
 What a [scheme]. I thought I was purchasing some templates - generic data models oriented for specific industries. This book is a teaser for the author's electronic products, which contain the real templates. This book has just enough information to lead you to believe the electronic product is plausable, but not enough to really use the data models discussed(without the expensive downloads). I expected a bunch of entities with the PK and FK attributes ready for customizing with my company specific attributes... NOT 
 I was disappointed in the latest Lincoln Rhyme mystery. The book had more twists than a Chubby Checker song and in the end they strained credibility.  Rhyme and Sachs are called in to solve a string of murders by a serial killer calling himself the Watchmaker. Rhyme has met his match with the Watchmaker, a meticulous killer who leaves nothing to chance and leaves few clues for Rhyme to follow.  Running parallel to the story of the Watchmaker, Sachs is also lead detective on her first case - a case that appears to involve police corruption. Sachs is juggling a heavy case load as well as rumours that her own father may have been corrupt. Ron Pulaski steps up to help with crime scenes and proves himself to be a smart and resourceful officer but ultimately it is up to Rhyme and Sachs to solve the case.   The book introduces Kathryn Dance, a visiting Californian expert in Kinesics, the study of body language. Dance helps interview suspects and witnesses and plays a role in solving the case. There is also a hint of romance with officer Sellitto which is ultimately left hanging. The information about Kinesics is interesting and Dance is a character that could have used more development.   The title of the book comes from a season in the lunar calendar, which is also a time of death. The book also contains a lot of information about clocks and time courtesy of the Watchmaker. There was some fascinating information, but at times the book was bogged down in historical details about clocks.  The book lurches from one plot twist to the next. At first it was exciting, but after a while it became tedious. NOTHING was what it seemed. Further I found Rhyme less likeable in this book - grumpy, bossy, pedantic and sarcastic. The only hint of humanity was in his fear that he may lose Sachs.  At times I found the writing clumsy. Deaver uses cliched adjectives in his sentences to describes his characters, such as,        "the handsome, sardonic and impatient criminalist" I found it trite to describe Rhyme that way.   This book is not as good as earlier Rhyme mysteries.  
  Did you see her, did you see Big Mama.     When these children arrived at their grand mothers house right away they were going to have a good time. The cool thing about this book is he rights another that tells you how they got home from the lake. This book is called Short Cut. I recommend this book to someone who just likes to have a good time.  
 First, let me state that I have been impressed by all the Canin I have read prior to starting "Blue River."  The problem with this novel isn't that it follows pattern similar to Canin's other works, most notably "For Kings and Planets," a far more mature novel, but that the protagonist is very hard to empathize with.  A successful California optimologist, the protagonist spends the too much of the narrative defending his materialism.  When he's not bothering with that, he's repeatly over-describing his less successful brother (After the first few times, I understood that the brother was violent and troubled during high school).  There's a good story here, but it's trapped under a poor, plodding narrative 
 I have the Bad Cats book and love it, that is why I bought the calendar. I did not realize the pics were in black and white. If I had known that, I would not have bought it. Like another reviewer stated, they should have put that in the description. I would not recommend this calendar. Hopefully next year they will make the pics color or they wont sell many 
 Sorry, but I actually hate that this record is so perfect.  Perfect performances.  Perfect sounds.  Perfect engineering.  Perfect everything.  Over-produced makes it synthetic and stale.  Surf needs a little character in my opinion.  Bottom line is that it's perfectly boring 
 In Momaday's Pulitzer Prize winning novel "House Made of Dawn," a young Native-American Indian named Abel, returns to Walatow Reservation in New Mexico from World War II. Only to discover that he is caught between two worlds. This book is a great example of Native-American fiction, it reveals the hardships of the Native-Americna people. Anyone who loves a good book based on storytelling and myth will find this book a must-read. It draws the reader in, with it's vivid description of the landscapes and ceremonies. At first I was a bit apprehensive in reading this book, because I have been told this is not a good book to read if you're reading Momaday's work for the first time. Yet, I enjoyed reading it, I apprieciated Momaday's effort to draw the reader in with the struggle of Native-American Indians living in industrial America. I recommend this book to anyone who is in search of a good book 
 If you are an absolute beginner and have never danced at all before, then you may find this course to be helpful.  Otherwise, there are better instructional videos out there. The technique and style demonstrated are not of professional calibre.  Also, the course claims to demonstrate 30 patterns.  The number is nowhere near that, and is closer to 15, total (almost 5 basic patterns per dance).  I say almost, because in one of the patterns, he calls the exit of the step by another pattern name. Sadly, the pattern name he uses is nothing like the pattern known in most dance circles.  However, the audio CD which is included is quite good. 
 Do not read this book. I attempted to read this book for a college class. This book should be cut down to the size of a magazine article and be published in a scientific journal. The public should not be misled into thinking that this book is readable. It is written at too high of a diction, and Griffin rambles on for 20 pages on one topic, which I won't spoil for those of you unfortunate to read this trash. The subject information is interesting, but this is written poorly, and will bore the reader to tears. Just thought I'd let you all know 
 Words need not even be wasted on this product. Besides each character having a different voice than that in the movie, the audio effects are terrible, as well as the actors and script. The one good thing about this product is its availability is limited. Save your time, save your money. Don't let Lucas put his hand in your pocket 
 I was very disappointed to discover that this book had a homosexual character. This is absolutely inappropriate for a young adult book, and unless a parent has read the reviews that mention it, said parent would have no clue as it sure isn't mentioned anywhere on the blurb in the book.  I usually am more aware of what my daughter is reading, but this time this particular book slipped under my radar.  She told me that it had a reference to a gay character, which I took to mean just a passing reference, but when I read the book, it was treated more seriously than I thought, even going so far as to have the two girls kiss.  It is inexcusable, both on Ms Pierce's part and on Scholastic's.  No matter what the author's personal beliefs, it is irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to parents. I believe that as a parent, I'm the one responsible for what my children see and do, but it sure helps to have some type of information so I can make an informed decision.  Anise Hollingshea 
 Leaving aside the fact that the author lied through his teeth (e.g. he never actually studied Hwa Rang Do - he offered the Lee brothers some ink and they gave him a faked history) this stuff is about as inefficient as any stick fighting book I've ever seen. Try Marinas' Panandata, Mark Wiley, the Presas brothers, Leo Giron or Ray Galang for stick stuff. You'll be much better off 
 I enjoyed alot of the facts in this book and I really enjoyed the excerpts from FBI files and such, but I did not enjoy the main author.  This book has some real valid and promising advice, but the author injects himself into the book far too much.  This book seems less like advice and more like a publicity campaign for the author.  Co-authored by Diane Holloway Ph.D., who did alot of the research and I believe is responsible for the excerpts I did enjoy.  If you're a die-hard Detroit fan, then I say go ahead and get this book but be warned the author has a pretty crummy current view of the city that's unfair and biased especially since he doesn't live here anymore 
 This is not an easy book. The language is preety tough and the writer seems to assume that you already know C. The terminology is hard to understand. I went and bought an oreily book and I learnt alot more from that smaller book than this book 
 Zandalee, Zandalee, Zandalee.  Where do I start? Well, I watched this movie on cable a couple of times when I was still a child, and I remember it being a good but forbidden movie. I decided to buy the movie before it became obsolete and enjoy a smut classic. But watching it as an adult has shown me one thing: it's bad in every way. From the bad Louisiana accents to the narcotics inspired acting by Nicolas Cage to the pedestrian acting by Ericka Alexander to the silly script writing. It's very bad. Even the s/ex scenes are not as good as I remembered: a couple come off as rape scenes, which will always be dangerous considering how many confuse rape with  consentual desire already. I guess my changing view about Zandalee says a lot about the eyes and mind of a 12 year old versus that of a 25 year old.  Bottom Line: No wonder the film has been conveniently forgotten by those who had anything to do with it 
 I am in the planning stages of a new business venture. I have never written a marketing plan before and needed some insight and advice as to what tactics work and how to write the plan itself.  This book reads like a list of useful one-liner marketing tips and examples of how the author's friends have used them.  It is not a how to book on writing a marketing plan, and it does not go into much depth as far as how you might accomplish the things that he recommends.   The most annoying part of this book is that every other page contains an advertisement for you to join some 12-week commitment mailing list that the author has created.  He entices you by saying that you will receive additional tips and information for 12 weeks.    HELLO!!! McFLY!!! Didn't I just buy your book so that I could learn your marketing insights?  YES!  So then why do you make it seem like I just paid for the teaser information, and that the good stuff is behind the curtain that requires me to become a pawn in your marketing career?  My price of admission stops at the price of this book, and it should not seem like I'm only getting half of the story that I paid for! 
 This is a wonderful book but I was sad to discover after receiving not only my first order without a CD, but my second REPLACEMENT order as well, that Amazon does not include your CD recording with your purchase as described.  I would recommend searching elsewhere for this book 
 My boyfriend tried 1 item from this book, which worked great.  The other ideas he thought were too goofy to try, so its been collecting dust on the shelf.  For men who aren't quite sure what romance is or how to be romantic, I think you need to start slower & have more beefier manly ideas. Also, the ideas need to be simply not a huge involvement required, or no man is going to be willing to give it try. That's my 2 cents.  
 The author definitely has some issues with his father. It's always easiest to blame the parents. Although well organized, it's still a pretty cheap piece of whining. 
 At the beginning of this Sherlock Holmes pastiche by Caleb Carr, our friend John Watson, M.D., arrives at Baker Street to discover Sherlock Holmes perusing a mysterious coded telegram.  Once deciphered, the telegram proves to be from brother Mycroft, who--wonder of wonders, to any Sherlock enthusiast--has cabled from scotland to inform the Master his skills are needed in the matter of murder most foul.  To the train, Watson!  And don't forget your trusty service revolver!  Having quite enjoyed Carr's historical crime fiction, I was looking forward to seeing how he treated the world's first consulting detective. At first, my expectations for success seemed to be realised.  Watson's voice in narration, the initial depiction of Holmes, the outre nature of the crime, all are reminiscent of Conan Doyle at his finest.  However, as I continued reading, I began to be less and less satisfied.  Something was...not quite right, and it kept getting less and less right as the book progressed.  First off, it seemed to me that Carr had only the most superficial understanding of the characters, and this was not enough to carry them beyond the confines of Baker Street.  Once Holmes left his familiar props, he became quite flat. I always imagined the master with a twinkle in his keen, grey eye, but this Holmes didn't have one.  I did not see his excitement over the case or his delight in his own powers.  Carr also seems to have forgotten the numerous times Holmes was able to put distraught females at ease when Watson could not, which made later portions of the books sit quite ill with me.  For his part, Watson was too...active.  We, the readers, know that Watson was an integral part of this duo, as does Holmes himself.  But John H. Watson, late of the Northumberland Fusiliers, was the most self-effacing of gentlemen, always playing down his role in order to cast a brighter light on the doings of his partner.  In the Italian Secretary, however, Watson takes an active role to the point that this tale seems to be one of his adventures, with Holmes merely a presence in the background.  We hear quite a bit about Watson sleeping, eating and dressing, but we don't see the Master at work.  And that disappointed me.  The other characters were two-dimensional in the extreme.  Mycroft had nothing to do and seemed to have been included because, well, it's a Holmes pastiche and so must include every single indication that we've read our Doyle (although the Persian Slipper was missing and Carr never did tell us WHICH pipe Holmes was smoking).  In the end, though, it was the crime that failed to excite.  Whereas it seemed in the beginning not to be without features of interest, the explanation turned out to be the most mundane imaginable--barely worth the Master's time.  In fact, the rationale for calling Sherlock in rather than the local constabulary stretched my suspension of disbelief to the breaking point.  Given that the crime was dull, Carr tried to liven things up with an action sequence at the end that was more Hollywood than Holmes.  The last three or four chapters were so tedious I could hardly get through them. I was reading this at the doctor's office and I nearly forsook TIS for People Magazine;  it was that dull.  Although I had hopes, Carr's take on Holmes was ultimately disappointing.  I still have found no one who is able to recreate Doyle's vision like Nicholas Meyer.  Save your money 
 Anyone interested in good color and sharp outlines should definitely avoid this book!  Reproductions  are sometimes dull and outlines often fuzzy.  Very disappointing.  I returned it immediately 
 Like Bernard Lewis, this author likes to portray a clash between West and Middle East.  But look at the other countries:  nobody is fighting the west, not even the Chinese.  Does anybody really think we can't get along?  This book is true only for the Middle East.    As for the rest of the thesis, that developing countries catch up with developed countries, this is a well known economic phenomena, nothing worth fretting over 
 I agree completely with the Becksted review (I also noted that it was helpful, but I meant it would have been helpful had I read it before I bought the CD).  This refers to the CD version.  I did listen all the way to the end, I kept thinking there was going to be something, but continued to be disappointed.      I found the analogizes to be strained beyond usefulness (evaluating someone's integrity by the size and shape of the wake they create... are their people waterskiing on it?)   It seems to be politically incorrect to come out in opposition to "integrity" in this day and age, but frankly this book didn't help me much.   
 I was terribly disappointed with this King release.  Could a creative writing student done better?  Perhaps.   It was by far the worst published work I've ever read.  It was unreadable.  Throughout the entire first chapter I waited for a plot to be formed.  The characters were choppy and the story went nowhere.  The book seemed to be published on his name alone.  I have been disappointed in S. King  for some time now and this book really cemented my idea that he has lost his touch.  I am a long time fan, I began reading him in 8th grade and the last good book I read, written by him, was Hearts In Atlantis.  
 Based on what I saw about this book it seems the "editors?" "Authors?" of this children's book were hybridizing the engenious works of Issa for their own gain. Not that it was conscious but I was searching for a SERIOUS collection of the works of Issa. Yuck 
 Although I am a fan of many bands which are often compared to The Merrymakers, I gotta say that this album just isn't very good.  I only bought this album because people have compared it to Jason Faulkner, Velvet  Crush, The Posies, etc..  The songs are boring and cheesily produced.  If  you want to find some good stuff in the power-pop vein, check out anything  by Teenage Fanclub or any of the other bands i mentioned because they know  how to make good power-pop (or whatever you want to call it) 
 I've just started reading Suzanne Brockmann's SEAL books & am jumping around (rather than reading them in order). I really enjoyed her most recent releases but found this novel annoying in its unlikely character interactions, less than sympathetic treatment by the main characters of Mary Lou, & unrealistic racist reversal of said Mary Lou.   You'd think someone in their little tight-knit world of heroes would admire such a YOUNG person who has stayed sober for 18 months, taken on the significant responsibility of child-rearing & trying so hard to fit in. That some sense of compassion would compel the wives & girlfriends (not to mention the husband) to do something other than sneer, etc.   With that said, I found it politically correct but highly unlikely for such a young, screwed-up-life-character like Mary Lou to magically see the light & have mushy feelings for a non-white man - regardless of how nice he was compared to her hero husband, that jerk Sam.  I read the book primarily to move onto the next one & hoped like crazy Mary Lou wasn't going to be killed off. I was definitely not rooting for that loser Sam and his perpetually angry un-girlfriend to connect.   As for Joan & Mike - the potential was there for some interesting stuff but too much energy was expended elsewhere 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 P.U.N.K.S. is a very bad movie even for a Disney channel movie. A boy is feeling neglected after his dad dosen't make it to his party and then finds his father is making a suit that is a robotic suit for a evil boss that walks with a crow on his shoulder. This is by far the WORST movie of the 1990s next to Titanic. This movie is only for kids and idiots because this movie is awful. Even Randy Quaid and Henry Winkler were embarrassed to be in this mess. If you want a good Disney channel movie watch The Paper Brigade. The only good part was the credits 
 As a dad, I was really looking forward to a book on potty training to help me with my 2-year old. This book is lousy though. Why?  1. Stupid Writing. I got pretty sick of constantly reading all the sappy, "witty" remarks. "Dancing the Potty Mambo"? Give me a break!  2. Stupid Advice. This book keeps telling you to talk to your kid like he/she is an adult. I'm sorry, but a 2-year-old just cannot comprehend a long drawn-out explanation of why you want them or don't want them to do something. How about just saying, "Don't do that!" or "Hey, you want to try this?" That seems to work just fine for me. Why give your kid a doctoral dissertation every time you want them to do something? What's wrong with just telling your kid what to do (nicely), and expecting them to be obedient?   3. Repeating Content. This book kept repeating itself OVER and OVER. Okay, I got it already! I strongly feel that the author wanted to push this book over the 200-page mark when all that needed to be said could probably have been accomplished in about 50 pages (or less).  4. Too Many References. This book constantly refers to other chapters. I once counted 6 different references to other chapters on one page. I am not kidding! Huh? Is potty training really that freakin' complicated? All I want is some general ideas on how to go about it, how to get started, and a few good tips. I don't need all these detailed references. (Nor do I need the phrase "Potty Mambo" repeated to me ad infinitum.)  Here is all I wanted to know: -How do I get started? -What do I do? -How often do I need to try it? -Should I go for pullups or just keep him in diapers for the moment?  Maybe this book got to all of that, but I quit after page 60. I just couldn't take it anymore. After hearing the phrases "Stay Positive" and "Potty Mambo" repeated to me for the umpteenth time, I had to quit. I returned this book and got my money back.  If I were to say anything good about this book, I would say that it has a few good tips, surrounded by about 180 pages of filler.  Potty training still looms ahead. Will I be successful? Probably. But to this book I say, No Thanks 
 It is so sad to me that the last several of the once intertaining Cat Who books have really been terrible.  I'm now on the lookout for another "series" to enjoy, and I'll only buy another Cat Who book at the dollar store 
 I would have to disagree with the pronouncements the book has to make.  I feel very strongly that the Bible does say much about homosexuality, in the concept of sin.  Thus I myself take a literalistic point of view of the Bible.  I believe the Bible is exactly as it says it is, the word of God, the message of God, to a fallen race--us.  The author, on the other hand,  takes a postmodern, very liberal view toward what the Bible speaks of and what the Bible preaches.  By maintaining a postmodern ideology toward the Bible, the author...as many other post modernists...have stripped away the Bible for what it truly means as God's message to the world.  In this case, the author has stripped away the truth toward homosexuality as viewed of by the Bible.  What do I mean?  Let me explain.    The Bible speaks of sin--those deeds that first manifest upon the soul, then formulates in the mind/body, and then done physically.  Within our souls is a cancer, a cancer that is born from our sinfulness in a sinful world.  It is because of this seed of sin that Christ came into the world through virgin mother as the prophets foretold, died on the cross as the prophets foretold, and rose again on the third day as the prophets foretold.  Sin is then "thought of" in the mind and body.  It is the whisper to do evil in our brains, the easier choice in comparison to the right choice, the lust, the desire, to want that burns in our minds and our hearts.  Then, when it is done, it is done through physical manifestation.  In this case, homosexual acts and actions.  Thus homosexuality is an act born of spiritual sinfulness and acted upon out of physical sinfulness.  However, and this is an important realization that is to be known from the Bible, homosexuality is just one of many sins that tempt and bring us to fall.  This, again, is a difference of opinion between myself and the author of this book.  I do not think that homosexuality is any worse than say gambling, or any better than say abortion.  All sins bring forth a wall between us and God, all sins must be forgiven by the blood of Christ so that we will be cleansed.  For you see, all sins are the same before the eyes of God, because they mare our souls and flesh, however, each sins has their own consequence.  And this is an important understanding toward the homosexual issue.  Homosexuality is just one of many sins and all sins are the same before the eyes of a Holy God, but its consequences are different than say adultery or stealing.  But know well that you and I are sinners too.  Our sinfulness might be different than the homosexuals, but we are still sinners that need the grace of God.  Our sinfulness, too, will have different consequences than the homosexuals, but still we are called to love the sinner (just as God loves us) but hate the sin.  This means that homosexuals should not be treated badly.  This means that homosexuals should be given our friendship.  This means that homosexuals can be loved through the love of friendship and through the love that neighbors are to have as the Bible speaks of.  What do I mean?  Well we are all sinners, and we all need Christ's grace.  If you are a homosexual, why should I judge you because of that homosexuality (as long as deeds such as pedophilea aren't done or other illegal actions).  I have known many a gay in my life and time, but I do not judge them, just as I do not judge those women I know who have had abortions.  Yes I strongly take a Biblical POV, and they know this, but I do not and will not treat any less because that would be a wicked deed.  You can agree to disagree about an action done, in this case homosexuality, without having malice or hatred toward the one who is washed in that sin.  You can give friendship to the homosexual while still maintaining a Biblical belief...the only thing that is called to you is that if he or she wishes to know your belief, you act with fearlessness in speaking the Gospel, the truth.  
 "Hunting Warbirds" primarily relates the story of the location and extraction of an RB-29 lost in Greenland in 1947.  As a story about modern archaeology it's fairly interesting, as a story about warbirds and collectors, it's superficial.  Other reviewers have clearly outlined the rambling nature of the prose: we go from Greenland, to the States for an interview with a "unique" collector (that doesn't really shed insight into Warbird Enthusiasts, except to say that some are obsessed. Anyone's who's been to a gaming or Star Trek convention can observe the same behaviors in the minority of attendees), back to Greenland.   But as I said above, "Who's the audience here?"  One of the concepts I was taught in my undergrad days was to write to the knowledge base of the target audience.  Mr Hoffman, seems to have ignored this advice in this work.  His NUMEROUS inaccuracies regarding WW2 aircraft, and aviation are enough to put off aviation enthusiasts, (the logical target audience) while the narrow scope of the book would discourage general readers.  The inaccuracies themselves always leave that "what else is missing, misquoted or just plain wrong here?" notion in the back of your mind.  This is frankly surprising since his resume includes "Air & Space" and "Smithsonian" magazines.   Finally, a better book would have at least summarized the efforts in Finland, Germany, and Russia to recover some of their warbirds from WW2.  Operations that in ethnocentric America, don't get their deserved attention. If you are an aviation or WW2 aircraft enthusiast, you already know this story-the book offers no addtional insight-certainly none into WW2 salvage as a whole.  If you have a slight interest in the subject matter, the documentaries about the salvage operation are a better medium 
 Some of these reviews are great.  Some are hilarious and show just how little each gender understands about the other.  My favorite review is the one that says something like "Women have more to offer than at any other time: they're better educated, they make more money, and they're more fun to be with than ever before!"  I'd love to see the statistical research backing up that last assertion.  Anyway, about the book.  Truly, all the content could have been packed into one essay.  The rest is just filler anecdotes that contribute little understanding but for some reason make up the vast majority of these types of books.  Probably because they're really not a whole lot to say on the topic.  My own experience runs something along the lines of the book.  I'm in law school and I've noticed that an extremely high number of law school women are very, very pretty yet have lots of trouble getting men interested in them.  Looking around, it's because these women are *extremely masculine.*  They have nice faces and bodies, sure, but to be a lawyer (or other professional) one must be directed, unemotional, focused, hard working, serious, outspoken and aggressive.  These are all traits that testosterone produces!  And it's true, the women in law school are far more like female men than anything else.  I'm dating a couple women who have no college degree but who are very feminine and soft and gentle, the complete opposites of law school women.  Most of the guys I know in law school are doing the exact same thing.  Therefore I think that these women are having a hard time finding men simply because men see them as other men, not as women!  Several of the women I know in law school are dating or have married rather effeminate men: artists, a whale trainer, etc.  These are not the types of men who are the "Alpha males" of the business world.  The more Alpha a male is, the more he wants someone who is his complete opposite: soft, gentle, giving, unassuming, submissive.. a girly girl.  The women mentioned in this book aren't girly girls, they're man-girls.  Who wants that?   
 I watched Battlefield Earth because it just went into rotation on a cable movie channel and I had to see if the rumors were true.  I made it to the end, waiting and hoping all the while for some redemption that would make it worth the trip.  Sadly that never came, and as the credits rolled I chose to fall in line with everyone else who says this movie is an unqualified disaster.  In fairness to Travolta (though he is hardly blameless), L. Ron Hubbard's story is the main culprit, horribly conceived and best considered another failure of many by a misguided loon.  That said, those who follow crazy people don't deserve much more respect.  If Travolta wished to venerate his fearless leader, the least he could have done was attempt to turn Hubbard's semi-fictional paranoia into something at least marginally entertaining.  Artistic license would have gone a long way toward saving this mess.  Instead, the story became a mockery of itself, leaving this production a sad effort from otherwise very talented actors 
 Funny people have it bad. When they're actually making you laugh they're fine. When they're failing to make you laugh they come off as desperate, flailing nerds. I was a huge fan of Stranger with Candy whose writing was incisive and brutally funny. Less so with the Book of Liz, and even less so with this book. Sedaris, Colbert & Dinello are funny people but this is an embarassment. It's abundantly clear now that they require a format (ripe for a send-up) to shine. Was there a 2nd draft or was this a cash-in for their agents? Every joke in this nervous-to-please dud is a throwaway. A tiresome type of joke starts on page 1. By page 2 you've detected the formula and by page 3 it's just grating. The plot is the flimsiest possible structure three smart asses can bounce bad puns & jokes off of. It quickly collapses. I could not complete it but I suspect the book ends up being lightweight crap. When you commit to nothing but your own funniness you never get around to questions of merit. This is a desperately nerdy book, just as the posed "funny" pictures suggest. (I've never seen less funny pictures...) Who was the intended audience for this? The dumbest person I know has a more sophisticated funny bone than this.  There's wit and then there's corn. This is a whole crop of the latter. Leave time for your own groaning if you plan to read the whole thing 
 The recipes in this book are simply not healthy for you. There is no nutritional breakdown as to fat content and calories at the bottom of every recipe. I agree with the others who have left reviews in saying to check online for healthy recipes using the Superfoods, the cookbook is a huge disappointment. 
 Don't play this CD on your PC, it does something that screws up the operating system.  I had to re-install Windows  :-( 
 I have admired Erdrich's writing in the past---"Tracks" and "The Beet Queen"--so I was looking forward to reading another of her novels.  I must say I was disappointed here.  Though Erdrich, like N. Scott Momaday, has a highly poetical style and her pages are filled with beautiful images (which is certainly a positive characteristic), a novel after all needs to have a strong story line or a point.  Beautiful sentences and poetic expressions do not make a story, even if spiced with magical realism, sex, recipes, and colorful beads.  As a literary testimony to a section of Native American experience, THE ANTELOPE WIFE has great merit.  But as a novel, in the company of all the novels of the world, I felt that in this case, Erdrich tried to stretch out her career and write the next book though her heart was not in it.  Perhaps it was a bad time in her life.  The novel felt to me as one written by a person "trying to be literary".  She writes of the mixed and intertwined fates of all those people of the Anishinabe world---Indians, whites, men, women, strong and weak---like beads on a string. The Indians come out holding the short stick.  Within this framework, individuals play out their fates, violence and love intermingling with mystery and mundane existence.  The characters somehow do not rise above their initial characterizations.  The women are stronger than the men for the most part: they endure while the men often fall into alcohol and despair.  The author writes in graceful style, but not much depth.  I felt---at the risk of sounding snotty---that THE ANTELOPE WIFE belongs more in the category of `chick-lit' than in `American literature'.  I once read part of a novel by Amy Tan, but could not finish for similar reasons.  I did read THE ANTELOPE WIFE in its entirety, because Erdrich's writing differs favorably from most other authors', but I grew tired of the soap opera quality of this story.   
 I admit I found the left behind series fascinating at the beginning, but I've noticed a steady decline in the quality of writing in the last few installments books, and a slow homogenization of all the "Trib Saints," into a single character. Absent are the somewhat strong individuals from the earlier books. Instead Rayford and Buck are virtually interchangeable (only Buck cries more). Chloe the super-mom who somehow manages to run an international co-op (along with other stay-at-home moms), from a burned-out skyscraper is an irritating sanctimonious pest, worse still is the transformation of Rayford who has become a one-man Rambo. Ben Judah seems to have become a somewhat disturbing cult-like figure of worship for post trib Christians. Are we honestly expected to believe Ben Judah is the only one who can read and interpret Bible prophecy?  I used to love these books, but I admit, I am tired of most of the main characters. The characters are all egotistical, self-righteous and sanctimonious. They show no compassion for the sufferers who are taking the mark, and even seem to take a certain glee in baiting Carpathianists and unbelievers.  Carpathia himself has become a buffoon. A cartoon villain about as scary as any villain on a Saturday morning cartoon. While I liked the series, the authors were at their best when the Trib force were a 'small group' out to defend Christianity from the anti-christ. In the Mark, they are clearly running the show. Ridiculous.  2 Stars. 
 TOUCH OF THE WOLF is a pedestrian effort.  The story - about an American werewolf who goes to England to find her family - is choppy, with holes here and there in the plot, quotes way too much poetry, and is cast with characters who aren't that interesting.  The heroine, Cassidy, is not very endearing - she's irritatingly nave (my eyeballs are rolling right now) and is way too desperate to find love.  She also fixates on Braden right from the start, though I don't know why exactly, other than he is the first werewolf she meets.  I thought Braden was more flushed out a character than Cassidy or his two siblings. His handicap was promising, though there seemed to be a lot of moments in the book where, superhuman senses aside, the author seemed to forget he WAS handicapped.  The story also seemed to suffer from moody melodrama and a need to make a secret out of EVERYTHING.  I understand that TOUCH OF THE WOLF is the first of a trilogy, the other two books following the stories of Braden's siblings (an annoying ice queen named Rowena and a cowardly trickster named Quentin).  I'm not quite sure I want to bother with their stories.  The reason I read TOUCH OF THE WOLF is because I adored TO CATCH A WOLF, which is about Cassidy's brother, Morgan.  I'm pretty disappointed that Cassidy's story was so dopey.  Oh well.     Update as of Jan 4, 2005: I just read a young adult novel called BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE that dealt with many of the same topics as TOUCH OF THE WOLF, including real-life issues such as fitting in, dealing with the loss of family, etc., as well as werewolf issues like determining the leader of the pack and the rules associated with breeding/mating.  I have to say the teen book, BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE, was a lot more sophisticated than TOUCH OF THE WOLF in every respect and was a much more engaging read.  BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE was shorter and set in modern times with a angst-filled heroine and, while it didn't have the full-blown love scenes found in a romance novel, it had a sexually-tense love triangle that was fun and exciting to read about 
 This is a classic example of "a band that never made it big"'s second life. The songs are pretentious and second rate at best. I give it only two stars 
 I found this book very depressing. Anne Lamott's constant self-deprecation throughout the book caused me to really doubt myself as well. I know she is doing it to show that she's human just like the rest of us, but I think she can show that without hating on herself every chance she gets (saying the 9-year-old version of herself looked like a neurotic cat woman, etc.) despite what she says about how you shouldn't do that. It's like hanging around with a bunch of anorexic models, it gets to you.  This is not a good book for people who are not sure they are writers. I am not a writer but I am interested in writing and I would very much like to write fiction but I have a lot of trouble writing authentically. Lamott sends the message that "As long as you're a writer, as long as you're in our secret little club, everything will be okay!" 
 Well, I read through about 60 five and four star reviews before I gave up on trying to find somebody who was willing to tackle the problematic ending of this novel. Let me start off by saying that I was loving this book all the way through Part 5. The cliffhangers were great, I loved the authentic Southern voice King breathed into each of the characters. He had crafted something so good. And then he didn't treat it with the care it deserved. Part 6 was weak, seeming inconsistent with the characters and the tone of the book.  The problem is you have characters that have displayed heroism in every other circumstance suddenly choose cowardice. Paul, Brutal, Harry, Dean and even good John Coffey all decide there is nothing left to do but go through with the motions. Is it their failure in this decision that leads to Paul's unhappiness, his "damnation" as he states?  This book starts with a message of tremendous hope. There are miracles. God works through the most unlikely of instruments. But the book concludes with near despair, that God permits all the bad things to happen and responds that "He doesn't care." What a careless way to conclude-completely sapping out of us the hope that the rest of the book has enfused us with! It is affronting to a spritual mind. Obviously God does care, pouring out grace and miracles so often that we've labeled them commonplace, and commissioning messengers that mankind kills. Paul Edgecomb is such a great heroic character throughout the book, King treats him so poorly in the denoument. It pains me to say it, because I feel like I am chastising a wise old friend. Yet he need not look to the heavens for the cause of so much suffering, but deep inside for his own shortcomings in saving an innocent life 
  The fundamental problem with each of the stories in this collection (NICE BIG AMERICAN BABY), is that the author is trying to force what she wants in the world by illustrating archetypes that only in a clichéd sense, the reader would have sympathy for; and reaches the lowest in the final story "Motherland" that is silly, just plain silly.  The writing is weak and doesn't do much except make me think that the author didn't properly revise her work, or simply in the case of the many film screenplay like jumps in which a short paragraph is used to illustrate something about a character, it just seems like she is a very lazy writer.  On the whole, the collection of short stories comes of as a weak form of magic realism, but the problem is that there is not innate spirituality in her writing and even though I don't care much for Marquez, the dean of such writing, he at least imbibed passion into his vivid, colorful world and that is what is needed for that type of story to work; as is, Budnitz's deadpan delivery makes it seem as the author simply has little interest in the world around her, but, moreover, a simple wanton desire to deconstruct the current society for all of its problems, due to the fact the she is merely bored, and if she is bored she should simply stop writing, which is sad as her first novel held such promise, now it appears Bunditz is simply in retrograde.   
 I have read this book and I do not agree with it.  Certainly eating vegetables is a good way to go and will help you lose weight- no doubt about it! However, the author cites acid as the cause of all of our ills and diseases.  Let us take a good look at that.  Ascorbic Acid, you know Vitamin C, which is said to be the closest thing to cure the common cold.  Guess what that is an acid.   Linaus Pauling, a real doctor, not one that got his degree online at some school that he can not reveal, used to take up to 15,000 mgs a day of ascorbic acid (over 200 times what Centrum has).  Did it kill him, no he lived into his nineties, over twenty years longer than the average man.  So much for acid being bad. And the stomach what is that composed of?  HCL, Hydrochloric acid, and if it did not, you would not be able to digest your food.  Also that acid, destroys bad bacteria, parasites and yeast. In addition to this there are other acids which we need to survive on, such as Amino Acids, which are in every protein you eat.  Also I am sure you heard of Essential Fatty Acids, Omega 3's.  Scientists will tell you they are some of the best things to eat, and are essential to the body.  Still think acids are bad? The bottom line is the authors credentials are dubious at best, and he should have stuck to what is true in his book.  That is that vegetables are the best thing for you and will help you lose weight and get healthier 
 The sole is high-profile and well-cushioned.  However, the top material is a soft and flimsy towel-like material that does not provide any lateral support for the foot.  With any walking pressure to the side (as in turning a corner!) the foot is allowed to slide and "fall off" of the sole in a sprain-your-ankle sort of way.  I felt very at-risk when I walked in them 
 I read the first chapter and though this book might be enlightening. I advise anyone who buys this to stop after the first chapter or at least skip 2,3,4. The author doesnt offer much in the first several chapters of the book he simply glorifies him self and doest stop talking about himself, "I did this, i did that, i am this,.." When he does finally quit floating his own boat and start to talk, he gives the impression that all modern medical practice is a conspiracy. Oh you have cancer!, dont go to a dr. there evil, get some ginsing and meditate. Im not saying alternative medicine is bad but it has its place along side modern medicine, and should not be considered a complete replacement 
 I was very disappointed and feel that the only DVD worthwhile in this set is "High Society"--that deserves 5 stars! The other DVDs lack the quality and better-known Cole Porter song content. I would recommend buying High Society by itself, which, ironically, was my initial intention 
 I don't listen to this kind of music as I really hate the whole radio/alternatine scene.  I worked in a music store when this album was released and must have heard it 5 or 6 times a day as we had to play new releases in the store.  Although there is no talent in this band vocal or instrument wise, the music made me reminisce about high school days.  Anyway, this was a flavor of the day type band who has been forgotten about by now.  It was obviously a group created by music execs to have some radio play, milk every dime that it was worth and then thrown out like old chewing tobacco.  It's such a shame how music is being ruined like this. 
 I bought this book because I really like fashion and I can (barely) fit into some of the sizes that author lists in this book.  However, by appearances, the author must have targeted 10% of the population that have a 24-28 chest size.  And, one must wonder of the 10% of the population who fall into that category, how many of them actually knit? Come on, the average American female isn't a 24-28 chest size!!!   With that said, I also believe that the author also targeted this book for clairvoyant knitters because the instructions are vague, the details are missing and she assumes that you know when she asks you to M1, you know which type she's referring to.  And, when you decrease, you know which type of decrease is required.  While I'm not a beginner knitter, I like explicit, detailed directions.  This book lacks all of that.  This is a definite PASS for anyone who is thinking of actually knitting from this book.  You will end up frustrated and disappointed.  Don't waste your money 
 I am a French myself, I've noticed that there are a lot of books to teach people out there "how to be French", "how to eat like French", "why French are so great", for me, it is very strange. Of course France is a great place with all those history, food, museums, culture. But we also have a lot of bad things. So prasing French all the time is a bit non sense and it really makes us French more arrogant. (Yes, we are too arrogant and proud of ourselves). Even being a French myself, I have to admit it. We should learn to respect other culture and people. But all these books are making us feel like privilage. There is another book called" French women don't get fat". To be honest, we have a lot of fat people in Paris, a lot of women out there are not slim or as elegant as the books described. These books making the girls here feel like they are godness, which is bad. More and more people here are thinking they are the best. But the fact is, we have high unemployment rate, our streets, metros are so dirty, our people don't want to face the reality. We love to enjoy life too much, but we are too lazy to earn money to support ourselves and we are rejecting other culture. So wake up, we are all equal. Don't let our surface fool you. 
 Mr. Rushkoff...what were you reading? The view you hold of the Scriptures, of Kadosh texts founded on revelation, and study..The Torah--the Navim - the Writings- seems to be another one than we have had as a people for these thousands of years. I can not recommend this book 
 ...because I thought White Oleandar was brilliant. But this book? Not so much. I would not be surprised if Paint it Black were something Fitch wrote before she got her bestseller published. It felt much less fully realized. I found the text to be sprawling, unedited, self-indulgent. I generally have no problem with unreliable and/or unlikable narrators, but this one was more tiring than she was menacing. The whole book was written in one note, so I, too, agree with the "flat" description. I found the characters (the distant, brilliant, rich mother; the sassy best friend; the beautiful, troubled boyfriend) to be very stock and borderline cliche. I absolutely savored every word of Fitch's first book; reading this one, unfortunately, was like returning to a restaurant where you'd had the most amazing creme brulee of your life, only to find it cold and runny the second time you ordered it. 
 This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other.  When does that ever happen?  The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids.  What 12 yr. old worries about "..never getting out of this small town."?   I guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends, then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense.  I have a feeling Oprah would like this movie.  
 After looking at numerous books and reviews here on Amazon, I picked this puppy up.  Here's what's happened since: 1) I've repeatedly thought "wow, what a poorly written book." 2) I've been trying to find something of value in the book. I tell myself, "well, I bought the book - I should probably try to finsish it."  3) Then I tell myself "But hey, you should respect your time more." 4) I think to myself, well, what if *somewhere* in this book there is a bit useful information? What if I went to page 223 and found a gem of information that's very good?  5) So then I flip ahead to page 223 and sure enough...nothing.  If you want a book that is basically a collection of survey results from what appears to be poorly conducted and researched surveys of a few VC's and entrepreneurs, this book is for you. It has absolutely nothing of value in it concerning how VC's find, judge, value, and finalize a deal. It really only offers common-sense guidelines, which anyone with some basic experience should already have (or should have heard second-hand). There are no "secrets." None. I promise you.  I can honestly say that I've gotten very, very little of value out of the this book, and after page 186 I'm still trying to figure out if there was a drop of value in the thing.  
 We did this book in a bookclub.  The language in the book was a bit rough I thought and it was just plain weird.  Would not recommend this book for anyone to read. 
 This is a very bad book once you get past your self-conscious fear that you are missing something--I would say an alarmingly bad book: one has to wonder why this manuscript was submitted, and if submitted, not edited. This turns into a repetition of the allusive and graceful, for sure,  but unsubstantiated shtick of the by-now facile co-mingling of forms and genres, made even weaker by a lack of discipline to corral digressive discursions and courage to present arguments in at least occassionally straightforward logical presentation--this is all riffing on material we've seen before and it repeats and repeats and repeats itself. Yes, we can treat "Yahweh" as a purely literary-textual rather than an embedded national-cultic figure whose text was never naked and whose narrative was never uninstantiated in an actual religious-national culture (itself progentive but not, as a culture, textual-canonical), and compare this to the figure of "Jesus Christ as God" and then, propose a Gnostic trope of Yahweh's self-shrinkage in internally distancing (and neurotic) "zimzum."  Presumably we could also describe quantum mechanics in a poetical fashion and discourse freely on the feline qualities of Schrodinger bifurcated cattiness vis a vis the solid roundness of Newtonian physical matter--except we would be missing what was substantive and unique about the actual subject matter.   I will let Christians decide whether the oft-repeated and repeated remark that Jesus Christ is not Yahweh is meaningful or provocative for them; as a semi-agnostic Jew I would agree that Christianity has not supplanted Judaism and that Judaism will and must always attempt to define itself on its own terms. Still, I must wonder what this observation, when it comes for the second, fifth, and tenth time, actually tells us about the plurality of Second Commonwealth Judaisms, the full Gestalt of "Yahwehism" throughout patriarchal, Rabbinic, and mystical literature, or, indeed, the "Jewishness" of classic Christian doctrinal claims in an age where very Orthodox Jews (who do, it is true, practice the Law) now freely confess to belief in a dead Messiah, who will be resurrected, and who, many declare, is "the essence of God in a body".  Moreover, the second-and-third hand derived picture of kabbalah, most particularly the poetical post-Kafkaesque elaboration on the meaning and emotional import of "Yahweh's" zimzum is a debilitatedly reductionist and misleading summation for the reader of the contextual placement and import of zimzum and shvirat keliim within the rich panoply of inter-related Lurianic symbology as understood through its oral and written expositors. Just as Hamlet really is not Yeshua and Bloom's Yahweh is an over-familiarized and sized down version of the theophononic and hieraphantic Yahweh-Adonoi-El of Jewish tradition and practice, so is his Yahweh of zimzum an over angst-compressed shoebox size misimpression of the Divine Structure of actual Lurianic kabbalah 
 Taking gratuitous advantage of inner city poor seems a cheap shot for a wealthy white man. I have one question for the director: Why don't you make a movie and expose the degenerate aspects of your own people? Exploiting others is no way to make your way in this world. Even though such behavior made your father rich, you should try to be a better man 
 I ordered two of these CDs; sent one to my son in Seattle and had the other mailed to my home.  My son's was fine; I could not open mine.  When I put it in the CD player and hit play, it started briefly and then turned off.  I tried a couple of times to report this to Amazon, but never succeeded in reaching them.  I paid $8.99 for each and feel I should get a refund. I still have the disc; my daughter tried it on her's, to no avail also.  So, I guess this is a complaint w/Amazon not The Best of Buffal Springfield.  Joan Kell 
 I've been looking forward to this album for quite some time, and man, what a bummer that this is what I've been waiting for.  After several listens, I still can't find even one song worth putting on a mix cd.  Come on, guys, you can do better than this 
 "Success" is a fluffy concept. Whatever it is, the author doesn't attempt to define it. Her advice, to be "successful", you must be loyal and you must make the boss look good. There is little more substance than this. It appears to be a book format rehashing of  the author's seminars. Worse, the message is contaminated by a disturbingly noticeable undercurrent of sexism throughout. The author clearly plies a "feminist" agenda. It is emblematic that all of the quotations placed at each chapter head are those attributed to women.  I rarely have become so annoyed by a writing to want to be rid of it. Because it is so disagreeable, I could not in good conscience even give it away to anyone. I have had to return it.  I recommend more worthwhile and substantive works such as "Crucial Conversations", "Crucial Confrontations", "What Your Boss Doesn't Tell You Until It's Too Late" and "Winning Office Politics" 
 I haven't finished listening to this yet and I'll probably shelve it. The original soundtrack is THE BOMB, one of the best film scores ever, but this doesn't live up to its name of "More music from Braveheart". It seems like an ill attempt at squeezing more money out of a good thing. There are only a few unreleased tunes on this album (I counted 5 out of the 25 listed). If you want to hear the speeches over again, I suggest watching the movie instead. This was a disappointment from an otherwise exc. original movie score. Save your money and continue to listen to the first one 
 How sad it is to see what began as a fun series of books end this way. The only good thing in this book is the departure of Polly.  She was much too staid for Qwilleran who needs some fun in his life.  Years ago we did not understand why the author "bumped off" the doctor love interest, suddenly turning her into a villain.  The series began to take on a certain listlessness.  That said, I would like to see Mrs Braun find a competent and enthusiastic co-author who can restore the original concept because Koko and Yum Yum deserve to go out in a blaze of glory.  Besides I would like to know if the barn actually was destroyed by the fire, even if Qwill himself didn't bother to find out 
 In Gobineau's novel, he attempts to back, scientifically, the inequality of races. Besides the fact that all human beings have been proven to indeed be human, regardless of the color of their skin, certain individuals continue to expose themselves to such thinking because it helps them to secure their lofty assessment of themselves. The novel is written in 19th century Western society, when the racism was an openly accepted aspect of society and people who held such views did not have do hide behid silly white costumes and purchase such books through the anonymity of online stores. People still cling to the hope that their is some basis their racism. All I could find in this book was a man's attempt to rationalize his own prejudices. If his "data" had led him to a more tolerant conclusion, I doubt he'd have published this book. Still, if you're hiding in your basement with a weapons stockpile waiting for the impending racewar, this should make for some ineresting reading, provided your capable of such a thing. I'm sorry, i've let my personal prejudices seep into my review. I'm a voluntary immigrant of African descent and i have little trouble holding my own against caucasian contemporaries. I also believe that I'm quite attractive. Gobineau's main point is that he likes more white people than people of color, irrevocable proof that they are superior 
 I'm not arrogant enough to say a certain thing shouldn't be held in high regard just because I don't like it. Everybody has varying tastes and different opinions. And since opinions and tastes can't be proven true or false or right or wrong, what does it all mean anyway?  I will say I definitely didn't like The Thirty-Nine Steps. Why?  1. How can an adventure story with chases and disguises be so dry and drab? I stopped caring about what Hannay did by the third chapter. I just kept on reading because of my "must finish all books I start" policy. Plus, I wouldn't have had any credibility to judge this book had I stopped.  2. The Plot. I still don't know what the whole thing was about. Either the reason these spies were chasing him was for the most convoluted reason in the world, or the thinnest, near nonexistent reason. There is a reason why I avoid espionage, Tom Clancy-like books. This one just happened to sneak up on me. Why did every man Hannay bumped in to just happen to be about his size? Who buys that you wouldn't be able to recognize someone just because they were in a different surrounding? Buchan used these two devices to help his hero even though both are improbable.  The book is short, therefore my pain was short. If you want a really, really good mystery, I suggest The Red Right Hand by Joel Tinsley Rogers, or even some Hercule Poirot books by Agatha Christie.  
 I love a great escape and a good story.  This was none of the above.  It reminded me of dull elevator chat that you aren't really paying attention to anyway.    Rarely can I not finish a book, but that's not the case with this one.  
 ...because I have! In his book on ACC basketball. In some cases, he  didn't change a word....just repeated the same anecdotes. I am really glad that I didn't pay for this book because I would have been really angry about re-reading old material.  If you like reading about ACC basketball, and you haven't read Feinstein's verrrry similar book, you will probably like it.  If you like reading about Big East basketball when you're not reading about ACC basketball...you might like it.  If you think that the basketball universe is bigger than the ACC, the Big East, and Feinstein's apparent obsession with Bob Knight, save your money for another book.  It's too bad, really. Feinstein is a good writer. I guess the big buckets of cash he gets from each book he writes has finally caused him to lower his standards 
 I almost put the book down after a 100 pages as I couldn't figure out what it was about or where it was going. The ending was equally bad, the book just goes no where besides talking about anti establishment type themes. Horrible. 
 It is nice to see that so many writers still believe in a Newtonian universe.  Deterministic, with a Prime Mover.  No bothersome questions about the origins of the universe, no need to explore the vastness of space, and a deep distrust of the possibilities contained in each new generation.  But it's ok.  Darwin loves you, man.   
 Sad to say this book is an embarrassment to both Psychiatry and the Christian faith.  However, neither should be blamed for the nonsense of a man who claims to represent both.  There is so much wrong with this book that it isn't worth getting into.  I find it highly ironic, though, that Peck is guilty of the same grievous sin and "malpractice" as the father of his character Jersey.  Jersey's father was a psychologist (not an M.D.), but use to put on a physician's coat when seeing patients.  Peck saw this as highly offensive and evil.  Yet he, a psychiatrist, had no qualms about pretending to be an exorcist and perhaps causing severe psychological, not to mention spiritual damage to his "patients."  If this book has any merit it lies in its ability to be a good case study on how not to practice psychiatry.  From reading his books I can't help but get the feeling that while Peck sincerely wanted to help people he was too caught up in himself.  Perhaps the enormous early success he enjoyed from "People of the Lie" did a trip on his mind.  I hope he and all those he treated can find healing.  Dominus custodit te ab omni malo: custodiat animam tuam Dominus. 
 I saw on the cover it said something about the New York Times bestseller list, so I kept reading (for a while) since I thought it must have something good in it to get on the list.  Well, it never did!  It's just a bunch of ridiculous long-winded drivel that couldn't get to the point.  The author dragged out the most boring unimportant acts for pages upon pages upon pages, and nothing ever happens.  The LONG descriptions are of something like Val whining ad nauseum how she doesn't want to go to this memorial service, or Jake acting crabby on the plane, or how Val sat around for hours looking at Tony's picture in her apartment, etc.  Anyway, I don't know how it got on the NY Times list, that's for sure 
 At least this album doesn't have "Unfaithful", so it gets 2 stars instead of 1.  Seriously though, what house would you want to roll up to, pickin up yo friends listening to this junk?  Might as well put Beyonce in, at least she's classy and has a better vocal range on ballads.  
 Please remove the reminder from my pag 
 Like many reviewers, I can truly appreciate the title track, Drops of Jupiter.  Great vocals, super keyboards and heart felt lyrics make this song(not CD) a true winner.  The rest of the CD just sounds like run of the mill pop that is here today gone tommorow.  She's On Fire, Its About You, Missisippi, and Let It Roll On are semi-memorable tunes with a few good harmonies thrown in for good measure.    Otherwise this group sounds like they are merely trying to find their sound.  It's too clean and pretty to be rock n roll but not natural enough to be country.  Its merely syrupy hum drum pop that does not offend me but certainly does not move me either 
 It is alright to present an alternative point of view, but it is not right to attack other recovery programs, especially those with a proven track record. I suspect Mr. Trimpey has an axe to grind or is just hostile to the spiritual underpinnings of 12-Step programs.The truth is that one size does not fit all. Some methodswork for some people and other methods work for others. Read this book and try this method. If it does not work try another one. They are all good in their own way. But Mr. Trimpey: If one person, who cannot be helped by your method, ignores other options because of your attack on AA, you should be ashamed of yourself

 I appreciate anyone's attempts to examine the deeper nature of life and share that with the rest of us. However, I could see a hole in Csikszentmihalyi's attempt from the beginning.   "In the course of my studies I tried to understand as exactly as possible how people felt when they most enjoyed themselves, and why. My first studies involved a few hundred "experts"--artists, athletes, musicians, chess masters, and surgeons, in other words, people who seem to spend their time in precisely those activities they preferred."  I'm surely not alone in wondering why on earth one would presume the above professions are strictly happy and "optimal experience". Particularly the reference to artists and musicians, who typically have severe struggles with life, and aren't on cloud nine just because some professors might like them in a couple hundred years. That is what I felt was the very weak point of the book--a study of happiness with almost no reference to unhappiness.   It goes on to talk about ways to find flow in our ordinary life, while dodging the bullet continually about why if flow was all those great people needed, did they still encounter countless problems and unhappiness. 
 I thought this book was for large size women. To help in increasing the size of the different patterns a person would want to knit. It was not. I was very surprise. Not a good book. For me it wasn't worth buying 
 I'm a fan of Janet Evanovich and her Stephanie Plum series, I think it's laugh out loud funny.  I didn't care for this story at all, it seemed sloppily constructed and I agree with other reviewers, lacked a story line or believable characters.  I left off a few chapters into it, there was no point in finishing.  
 I have seen many pathetic films in my life. This topped them. Did I rate one star? Sorry- I meant negative 11 stars. It was the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It was a total waste of three hours when I could have been sleeping. There was no point. The script and storyline were pathetic. The gore was overdone- too much blood, killing, and the like. It was totally historically inaccurate, and the Civil War scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable. All Civil War veterans are rolling over in their graves. Any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic. One of the abolsute bombs was when Clint Eastwood fires off a canon twice with his cigar- yet he does not even load it- either time. And somehow, without even aiming the canon, he knocks his 'friend' off his horse.   The movie is a failure. F-A-I-L-U-R-E. Crappy. Junky. Just plain DUMB. STUPID. PATHETIC.  I am not going to waste any more words on it. Just....whatever you do....save your money. Don't buy it. It's not worth 50 cents 
 While I am not qualified to pass judgement on sculpture as far as methods of actually creating works of art,as a art foundry owner,I have reasonable background in usage of diferent materials connected with sculpture. I found this book to be of rather limited use to anyone seeking information on materials in use today. Almost all refererences are very dated and may be considered useful if a study of yesteryear's practices are intended.It appears to me,that information on various metals and their processing  in particullar is more or less imprecise and in some cases wrong altogethrer-for example:to aneal common aluminium alloy to "pink" heat means going past melting point!To sum up,if you intend to learn current practices, go elsewhere 
 I am not a 'professional,' but figured out how to build a website with this program, which I bought thinking that it was going to help me produce more professional-looking websites/pages, and I invested a bunch of other money in how-to books I'd ordered here, and lo and behold, the server with which I have a website I maintain for my city gov't does NOT support any sites made with this program, and then I find that NEITHER DOES YAHOO where I have my personal site and have been promoting to the city to move their official website to!!!  I've apparently wasted a lot of money and had NO CLUE this would happen when I finally put a website together with this program.  I never would have imagined Yahoo would not support the most current page builders, but it could be they want to force people to use their wizards.  WHY would Microsoft not have a patch available or something to fix this problem so this program can be used for more than just my entertainment spending hours and hours trying to learn it and build something, then find out it was for NOTHING???  Of course, both the server with the city website and Yahoo work with versions up to 2002....but I can't invest another over-$100 for the old version now just for that.  Yeah, it's great....made a pretty page, but only I can see it.  If I could publish with it, I wouldn't have just given it one star here 
 People, I love Covenant, they have become one of my favorite groups ever.  This is total tripe compared to everything else they have ever done.  It feels like they either gave up, or ran out of creativity.  If I was them I would be absolutely embarassed by this effort, because they are capable of soooo much more. The only track I like, and I really digit, is 20 Hz.  It is one of my favorite covenant tracks ever. Everything else? Garbage. Just being honest people, don't force yourself to like it just because it is Covenant 
 I purchased this as a book on CD and it was horribly dull.  I kept waiting for something "meaty" but the characters were completely flat.  The voices on the Audio book were horrible and the Marilyn Monroe voice of the car was completely far fetched.  It never came together as a book and I was so glad when it was over.  This was the first Janet Evanovich book I read(listened to) and I am not willing to waste more of my time with future novels 
 I received a promotional copy in the mail, and I thank the author for that, since I didn't waste any money on it.  This is a truly unoriginal book. After reading the first few pages, I could see where it was going. I scribbled a few ideas on a piece of paper and started flipping forward through the book. Sure enough, he hit every one, and not much else.   This is another rehashing of every rah-rah book you've read on sales, and there are many hundreds of them. I've read several dozen of them, and they all sound the same after a while. The real problem with a book like this is that there might actually be something new in here, but I'd never want to spend the time reading to find it.  Typical sections: You Gotta...visualize success You Gotta...think like a winner You Gotta...sell yourself You Gotta...go the extra mile You Gotta...use the power of numbers  You Gotta...do better than this to sell this book 
 So: alien civilizations with obviously vastly superior technology travel clear across the galaxy at speeds greater than the speed of light in order to--well, won't give the plot away, but trust me, they're not here to guests on Martha Stewart. And I find the plot, therefore, and all of these "aliens as terror sources" movies just--can I say this?--not fair to aliens!  OK, I don't have an aluminum foil hat on, I just think its childish. Stephen Greer, MD's "Hidden Truth" book suggests that this is the sort of fare we are to get from Hollywood--no more friendly E.T. types, just constantly the message of terror from the skies. This trend in cinema about foreign visitors is now so consistent that it just makes movies like this dull and predictable. And how we eventually beat back the aliens in this movie? Oh, you don't want to know.. 
 I marvel at the origins of marvel comics. This man is such a liar!Does  Stan Lee have no shame? If you really want to know how Marvel Comics came  to be,read some background on one Mr.Jack Kirby.For Stan Lee to say that he  would come up with an idea then pass it along to Jack Kirby is not only  ludicrous but also peposterous.Stan Lee also fails to mention many artists  who where also working at the Marvel bullpen at the time.Many artist who  where working at Marvel at the time have gone on to state that Stan Lee  never wrote a single story!! The way the artist of the day would go about  writing a story would be by writing it along the borders and making it up  as they went along.If this is true,then Jack Kirby created the entire line  of characters for Marvel Comics.Many of the more important ones any  ways.The Incredible Hulk,Captain America,The Fantastic Four,Thor,The  X-Men,And The Avengers to name a few.And also not to mention the cover to  Amazing Fantasy #15.When Stan Lee states very proudly that the idea for The  Fantastic Four was all his ,it upsets me.If you are really a true comic  book fan then you would know that the Fantastic Four are just recycled  characters from Simon and Kirby's Challengers Of The Unknown.Which , I  might add was published for D.C.Comics and not for Marvel.Jack Kirby was an  artist and an idea man when he and Joe Simon collaborated together.These  two men came up with many characters and many ideas together.At least Mr.  Simon had the decency to admit it.But the same cannot be said for Stan  Lee,he and he alone wants to take credit for the creation of Marvel Comics  most memorable heroes.This book is filled with nothing but self  glorification and staight out lies put to paper by Stan Lee.Excelsior my  foot,how about expell yourself?Very little is said about Simon &  Kirby's creation of Captain America for Marvel comics in the forty's. Stan  Lee didn't even work for Marvel Comics at the time that Captain America  made his comic book debut!! Origins of Marvel Comics also speaks very  little about Steve Ditko,Don heck,and John Romita Sr. some of comicdoms  most famous artists.This book fails to aknowledge the contributions they  also made for Marvel Comics.But then again I guess that's the way Stan Lee  wanted it when he wrote this book.I belieive this book did very much  damadge to Jack Kirby's carreer.To this day he is not given the proper  credit he so rightly deserves.The way Marvel Comics treated Jack Kirby can  be compared to the exile of Moses from Egypt in wich his name must forever  be stricken from it's books and never be spoken again! I wouldn't recommend  purchasing this book but if you do,go right out and buy some material to  compare notes and then make your decision about the Origins Of Marvel  Comics . Pick up The art of Jack Kirby for refference because there was  never really  a "Marvel Age Of Comics,"there was only a  "Jack Kirby Age Of Comics." If you wish to send me your comments  or opinions send them to 3019 s. Poplar Ave. Chicago Illinois 60608.KIRBY  POWER!! and STAY ROMITALIZED! 
 The book concentrates on only a few scholarships and if you are not targeting one of these scholarships, the book is a waste of money 
 When I heard the Disturbed version of "Land of Confusion" I thought it might be from a Genisis tribute CD. Key kids, it's Phil Collins! Dork rock 
 Sure, being overprepared gives you a sense of confidence when entering the test room, but the extent that this book went was utterly impractical to the point of being innaccurate about what truly is on the test. For example, it bombards you with slews of obscure literary terms, tells you that you may have to read poetry in unitelligible local dialect, and oh, knowing 500+ years of the history of literature may help. After trying the practice problems on this test I was in a state of desperation (of course I procrastinated so this is the day before the test)and was prepared to just not show up on test day because it seemed so hopeless. However, after trying the Princeton Review book, I decided that if the problems were more like PR's the test actually might be doable. While the test was hard, it was no where near Barron's level; PR was much more accurate. I couldn't break 700 on Barrons and ended up getting a 780 on the real thing. Unless you have a ton of time to prepare, I really would not recommend Barrons. In the end though, what will prepare you the most for the SAT II Literature are the skills you've acquired over the years in English class and reading challenging poetry and prose on your own time 
 If you want to study internet advertising history,this is a great book.Other than that,it is a complete waste of time,effort and money.I am surprised that you can still see and buy this outdated book on the  bookstore shelf 
 Basically what you are asked to do in this book is generate dozens of lists on your own and that this process will somehow create an epiphany of your ideal career.  In the beginning, I forced myself to be open-minded about this process, but found that writing interminable lists, which did nothing to clarify what was already floating in my head, did not lead to a career decision. I suppose that this process is supposed to spark ideas and new insights - it didn't. All the stuff that I wrote down was information I already knew quite intuitively and seemed obvious (e.g., I want a job where I get along with co-workers). What I needed was something structured and concrete that would point me to certain careers, which this book really doesn't do.  
 This was like a kid's first reader for adults.  Only about 20 pages, and definately not worth more than a dollar or two. It should be marked more clearly that it's not really a "book". I was very disappointed 
 A better title for this book would be, "A Guide to the Military Cemeteries of the Somme and the Heroes Buried There." You can find small books like this in almost every military-themed park. However, they are seldom written by first-rate historians by Martin Gilbert, who should have had better things to do with his time.  The background information on the campaign is about as detailed as any other historical account on this scale, but I read through the entire thing without feeling I'd gained any insight as to why these generals, these soldiers, these cultures, and these nationalities put themselves through this horror. Gilbert seems unwilling to criticize, analyze, or to put any kind of scholarly context to his story. Most of the book is an endless series of he did this, it was awful, he died, he was buried here.   Even as a popular history, The Somme leaves a lot to be desired. When I read accounts of, say, Chickamauga, Gettysburg, or Shiloh, important battles in the American Civil War, I expect--and almost always get--enough description to understand or feel what made these crucial and dramatic confrontations different from each other. Almost all of what Gilbert has to say about the Somme Offensive could be applied to any of a hundred battles on the Western Front in World War I.  At a more sophisticated level, I hoped to learn something from this book about a great historical tragedy, one that had profound effects on British society and history when it happens, and, I expect, still does today. However, I will have to find another book that actually addresses those topics.   Too bad, too bad, too bad. The Somme scarred an entire generation and an entire society. This story needs to be better told and someone else will have to do the job 
 2/15/07 - Received coffee maker with minor outside box damage but eveything seemed intact. Made several pots of very good coffee and espresso but after 4 days the main switch and digital readout went crazy and the water heating element for the coffee side refused to turn off. I had to unplug the unit fearing a fire. I am returning the unit to Delonghi. I will review the new unit after I have had it for a while.  4/2/07 - I recieved the new unit in good condition and set it up with some trepidation (see earlier review). All the functions work fine and the coffee/espresso maker has been chugging along fine. It has made more than 50 pots of very good coffe and about 30 pots of espresso that even my Cuban colleagues enjoy. Based on my experience with the new unit so far, I would increase my rating to 4 stars, however Amazon will only allow one review per person. 
 With all due respect to sincere but sincerely misguided believers who look to Carl Sagan+Hugh Ross scientific priesthood to explain Genesis Origins for them 'logically & scientifically', address these loving Christian concerns:  1) It's o.k. to debate biblical issues in a public forum. Attacks on the faith come from outside and INSIDE. Ross is unwittingly attacking the authority of Scripture from INSIDE and needs rebuking in love and truth.  2) It's not whether some portions of Scripture are literal vs. nonliteral. It's letting the Bible speak for itself and clearly indicate how it's to be read. 'God as Rock' in Psalms is poetry. Genesis is NOT Psalms or even psalmic. 'Evening and morning were first day', etc. is NOT poetry or figurative. See Exodus 20:9-11 '6 days you shall labor, but the 7th day is a Sabbath.In 6 days the LORD made heaven and earth..but rested on the 7th day.' Is this poetry? Psalms? Not. Sorry to all who force this historic documentary narrative text to be plastic enough to insert saganism billions & billions. It just is not what Moses intended to write or Hebrews understood him to mean. Nor should it be today. Yom can sometimes (not normatively) mean indefinite period, but NOT here. Try your theory elsewhere.  3)Take care when you depend on modern astrophysics to interpret the plain Bible text. Moses was not a PhD nor scientist. Neither are billions who have read Genesis in the past 3500 years. If vast majority take Moses in plain simple sense 6 days equals Sunday thru Friday of first workweek, astrophysics reinterpreting it to 17 billion years is humanism dismissing God's creative supernatural miracles. Reductionism and unbelief.  4)What's the big deal whether Genesis is real, literal, documentary, history book young earth recent creation as plainly stated in situ? Get it wrong here and it carries over to the rest of Scripture. If Genesis 1-11 is poetry or nonliteral story or myth or figures of speech, then so is Exodus, plagues, Red Sea, miracles, Ex.20:9-11, etc. and even into New Testament documents. It's now all up for grabs just the way satan wants it. By all means, doubt the plain wording of God's Word! Slippery slope-ism = sloppy theology = slapdash hermeneutics = slippage in Christian faith.  5)To be fair, why not try reversing the 'harmonization' process? Instead of forcing Scripture into Sagan-Ross mold of fallible secular theory of billions & billions of lightyears, try letting 6 calendar days of God's infallible heavenly recording of eyewitness events be the fixed standard of how human inquiry should be reconciled to the real record. Science must be somehow wrong in its assumptions, assessments, conclusions. God must have turned heaven's lights on instantly with speed of light = infinity during sun/moon/star creation Day 4 when scattered, disembodied light already existed for 72 hours instantly became bodied. Today's scientists from saganism to rossism are using earthbound measurements on heavenly reality. Their mistake is understandable given limited preconceived notions of how things operate POST-miracle week. God's presuppositions are needed as divine corrective. Telescopes and parallax and triangulation and math don't work on Creation Week itself any more than other sciences trying to figure out and measure Jesus' DNA, changing water to wine instantly, casting out demons, Peter's shadow healing the sick or the Lord's resurrection, materializing in and out of sight over 40 days penetrating locked doors with a real flesh/blood body, ascension, etc.  Friends, it's all a category mistake. You simply can't use earthy calipers to come to grips with heavenly data. Back to the drawing board of faith in Genesis-Revelation AS WRITTEN ORIGINALLY UNDERSTOOD BY AUTHOR/AUDIENCE of 1500BC to avoid the fallacy in saganism-rossism-modernism-revisionism-secularsciencism.   Peace to all who let Christ's Bible speak without manscience stretching 1 young week.  
 I just wanted to warn those contemplating this purchase that we found nothing whatsoever funny in the 3 episodes we suffered through.  This is not different just because its 'British humor', because we own and enjoy several sets of BBC comedies.  I think this will be enjoyed only be a select few.  
 To learn what Cramer knows about recent swindles (now, after the fact) or what financial products Cramer "sells", read this book. Cramer does a great job of beating you down, then offering to be your personal savior. _____________________________________________________________ So this is what I had to say about Cramer a year ago, and now I'm a total Cramer junkie.  His radio show (...) is the best source of timely, unbiased, practical information I have found in 20 years of investment AND IT'S FREE.  Jim is right most of the time, but he also is the first to admit when he has made a mistake.    Thank you, Jim, for giving me the courage to fire my broker, improve my investment performance, and save $25,000/year in fees 
 Although I enjoy most of Metheny's work and much of Ornette's, this album just doesn't work for me! Buy it if you find yourself able to enjoy repeated listens to cacophany, but if melody or harmony or even harmelodics are your thing, look elswhere! 
 Most poeple insist that freedom of expression should be granted without any restrictions.  This book and the events which occured shortly thereafter state that the boundries of decency must be observed.    Those that argue that Hitler was a product of his time should look at the events in Bosnia.  Muslims were killed and placed in concentration camps just like the Jews in WW2.    In 1958 Britain detained 80,000 Kenyans who were fighting the British occupation.  Most of them perished due to torture.    Books like this must never be ignored because it is a lesson we should learn from.   
 I am a Christian who reads these sorts of books frequently. This is easily the worst book of this sort I've ever read.  First, Glynn simply isn't a very good author. His style is awkward and unengaging, and he often repeats himself.  Second, he takes away with his left hand what he tries to give with his right. At times he seems to affirm the New Testament and Christ, but at other times he offers up a kind of universalism (e.g. Hindu near-death-experiences of Krishna prove that God sends to us after death whoever we'll be most comfortable with). At other times, he supports the idea that any belief at all is sufficient, as "proved" by prayer and meditation being medically effective regardless of the content of the patient's "faith".  Glynn's theology seems to be pick-and-choose. He likes what he likes (like the Sermon on the Mount) and rejects what he doesn't like (like some New Testament commands concerning women, and apparently nearly all of the Old Testament). All of this combines the be a poor apologetic indeed. To follow his example appears to mean accepting what you want and rejecting what you don't want, which hardly seems controversial.  Lastly, he simply doesn't do a good job of collecting or presenting evidence. Instead of this, I'd recommend the book, "God?: A Debate Between a Christian and an Atheist" by Craig and Sinnot-Armstrong. It's easily twice the book this one is, and half of it was written by an atheist 
 This book is just plain stupid. If it works for people and helps them lose weight I realize they will be estatic. However, it is not healthy. Each of our meals should be balanced. These people are promoting unbalanced eating. The reason so many of us are carb sensitive is because we have spent a lifetime over indulging on carbs! If one were to sit down and eat each meal with balanced food groups, including complex carbs in small amounts, we would not only lose weight in a safe manner, but we would heal our bodies from the inside out. This diet won't heal us, it is a fad. If anyone is looking to really heal their metabolism, lose weight and even heal disease, try reading "The Schwarzbein Principle" by Diana Schwarzbein, MD. That is a great book on how to heal diabetes, hypoglycemia, and many other things. It also explains how eating balanced and giving up stimulants will not only help us lose weight, but reverse aging and stop having food cravings in the first place. This book promotes eating unhealthy foods and is only about weight loss, not getting healthy. 
 In the 1960's facing the cruel conditions of institutionalization and coercive psychiatry, writers such as R.D. Laing, Ken Kesey and Thomas Szasz commented on real oppression but took a swerve in the opposite direction. As a person with mental illness, I cannot agree with what Thomas Szasz is saying. Yes medication has horrific side effects. Yes coercion is wrong.  Yes some people are diagnosed with a mental illness who have psychological problems (but in another book he is opposed to talk therapy as well, what isn't this guy opposed to?), yes some people are given medication who could do without it, yes there are new diagnoses that are not credible (road rage) but mental illness does exist. Denying mental illness and then saying the insanity defense should be eliminated because of course people did it according to their own volition (according to Szasz's reasoning) is a classic extreme libertarian viewpoint, stating firmly what is wrong but failing to come up with humanitarian alternatives. Read any book by Judi Chamberlin (a real life consumer/survivor) or track down the movie Hurry Tommorow (about the horrific conditions in an institution from the point of view of the "patients") instead of this dated, academic, dully written excercise in philosophy that detracts from the people it is supposedly championing 
 This book was difficult to get through and I felt very disappointed  after reading it. Divakaruni's style of writing is good. She is quite descriptive but if felt she did a poor job with the story. I didn't care for any of the characters and still had too many questions after finishing the book. I also felt some parts of the book were drawn out too long 
 The people who put this flick together apparently don't understand the difference between combustion and nuclear fusion.  I don't want to sound like a Puritan here, but come on!  They shouldn't need a science advisor on the set to know something as simple as this ... all they need is somebody with a high school education.  Having said that, the movie wasn't completely worthless.  After I got over my initial irritation during the first ten minutes, I sort of got into the movie.  Some of the chases were sort of fun, and the special effects were pretty cool.  Morgan Freeman is always cool, even if he seems to play pretty much the same character in every movie.  Keanu Reeves did a marginal job, which for him is an improvement (we all love the guy, but even he knows that he can't act).  Near the end, there is more of the weird hydrogen combustion - nuclear fusion, which brought back initial irritation.  Do these people in Hollywood drop out of school after the sixth grade?  Duh 
 Alas, I've joined the group of dispointed consumers! I love Alton Brown, but this so called "book" is less (WAY less) than steller. I actually saw this at Chapters for $1.99 and couldn't bring myself to part with the Twoonie required to purchase it. All the previous reviews sun up my feelings - but I just had to add my two cents 
  	The book Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage is about the economy and the impact one scientist had on the world with his predictions.  Hubbert's theory stated that in the early 1970's oil production would reach its highest level. He was doubted my many scientists, but when it came true scientists used it to look at what the future holds for oil production. It is expected to hit this decade at some point. This book describes the origin of oil and development over the many years. It also describes several different oil fields and the prosperity of them, and the different types of techniques and bits used to find oils by scientists. Each scientist has different methods of finding the oil fields, and they use data sets to record the sites and sizes of them. It provides an overview of what the future holds for oil production, and what different kinds of energy we can resort too if needed to avoid the economic troubles lying ahead. 	I thought this book was overall pretty boring. I wasn't  entertained or hooked on it, and it didn't make me want to keep reading in the end. I found it very confusing most of the time, and it had a lot of information to try to digest all at once, such as numbers and equations. It wasn't the kind of book I really get indulged in, and want to read more of, or cant put down.  	I would recommend this book to those who like to read books about our economy and what's going on in different industries. This book is easier to read for adults, as it contains advanced material that could confuse younger children. For those who enjoy reading advanced books about our economy or oil, this is an excellent book. 
 On the most fundamental level, i.e.,a sexual/semi-erotic level, L'Ennui most definitely has its moments. As a total film, however, it stutters more than a few times. Technically, the subtitles occasionally flash too fast or are offered with no contrast so they become almost unreadable. The camerawork is quite good, however, with a definite European style. The story itself is also intriguing, but once the point is made,it has nowhere to go. The problems begin with the actors and plot. Not that the actors were bad; they were actually very good. But you understand from minute one that Martin isn't wrapped too tightly (his treatment of a fan, for example, early on), so his bizarre behavior once he meets Cecelia isn't surprising in the least. More simply, the guy evinces no sympathy in the least from the viewer; none. He's a complete ass. He comes off as needy, selfish and egomaniacial, one of those boors who are so deeply personally insecure they become outwardly obnoxious and nasty to hide it from everyone. You really don't care what ultimately happens to him, and also understand that if he did get what he wanted in the film, he would immediately reject it once he did, just to be hurtful. Cecilia, the more you get to know her, is just as bad in another way. She doesn't come off as stupid (as someone else said)or obtuse, but as almost totally uncaring and unfeeling, not to mention far more immature than her few years. She simply does whatever she wants whenever she can without a lot of regard of how it can hurt or affect people. She understands how they can feel things, but unless it touches her directly and negatively, doesn't really care. Look at how she regarded her father. All in all, it's hard to feel sympathy for her as well. She's not opaque but almost completely transparent. And to say the film's point was hammered home way too long or that the ending was ridiculously abrupt is putting it mildly. 
 I purhcased this book because I am intersted in world religions, especially those with elements of mysticism.  I have often heard references to the Kabbalah and I wanted to learn more about its contents.  I am a college student majoring in biology, psychology, and history, and my desire to study the Kabbalah stems not from required coursework but rather from personal interest.  If I were pursuing a degree in religious studies, or had I been repeatedly exposed to the concepts that Scholem discussed, I would have been fine.  However, it is nearly impossible for a layman to understand the subject matter as presented by Scholem.  There is simply too much jargon and Scholem's writing style makes me wonder as if he tried to make things overly complex to divulge his brilliance.    If you are an experienced religious scholar, most likely this book will be excellent.  However, if you're a layman who is attempting to get a feel for the basic concepts and principles of Jewish Mysticism, this book will only frustrate you because it's too advanced 
 This incredibly boring and technical book deliberately skips any possible entertainment value (No kidding - she sneers at other Ziegfeld books and movies in her preface) to focus exclusively on feminist revisionism.  Instead of telling us anything personal about the showgirls, headliners or Ziegfeld himself, the whole book is viewed through a psychoanalysizing lens that echoes that familiar boogeyman story, "How The Big Bad White Man Hates You".  Every musical act is sexually sinister, every costume a deliberate put-down, and only SHE can decode what they all REALLY meant. For example: There is a picture of Anna Held donning a costume where a black mannequin is affixed to her waist, making it appear that her servant is carrying Anna around in a basket on her back.  You've probably seen variations of this costume every Halloween but I'll bet you never saw any sexual meaning behind it, did you?  Well, the author does.  She writes extensively about the significance of the mannequin being attatched to Anna's waist, giving it an imaginary sexual significance that granted Anna the alleged animal-like sexual appetite of the *lower* class black person while keeping her face attractive, clean and white for the paying audience.  Oh yeah, OBVIOUSLY.  Sort of puts those Gorilla-holding-a-man-in-a-cage costumes you've seen in a different light now, doesn't it?  But REALLY now, could she have had the mannequin sprouting from her neck?   Or her back?  As Freud reportedly once said, "Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar."  A lot of the book is like this.  A LOT OF IT.  The author reads WAY too much into this stuff, and while I'm sure some of it has a basis in fact, the rest is opinion and revisionism on a grand scale.  It's the polar opposite of equally annoying books that breathlessly claim Ziegfeld's follies to be the apex of beauty and humanity, and that we've all gone to hell in a handbasket since.  The real story lies somewhere in the middle.  Remember that if you read this book 
 its really of of the least organized computer books ever.. bad starting point.. advanced examples starting from chapter one.. just gives u really HARD time.. im glad i just got it on a library loan and im gonna give it back... DONT WASTE UR MONE 
 The author of this book describes it as "Lots of fun" but forgot to continue the phrase and include "for the demented" because personally for me this book was no fun at all. I mean compared to some of her other books this book is really bad. I liked Catherine Coulter and i like most of her books but this one...well i regret having wasted money on this one. so boring i didnt even finish it! The main trouble with this book is the dialogue..long and silly. the characters are realy not likeable at all -jack and Grey. Grey's reaction to JAck's stealing his horse was way too exagerated and hard to believe. I would have liked to finish this book but, frankly after threee attempts i gave up because its so boring and childish. Yes childish and if you read if for yourself you will surely agreee. The author clearly tries to be humourous...but, in my opinion does not succeed in doing so. A book is not made humourous just by putting stupid dialogue and a silly storyline. I made a mistake because i chose to ignore the other reviews which were posted here and bought it anyway : 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be.  They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body.  Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first.  A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects.  Some don't make it out the other side.  I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone.  Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones.  I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too.  Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 I stopped reading Ludlum stories years ago, as I found his books to be so similar to each other as to make them boring.  I also had to deal with a regular feeling of deja vu... didn't I read this passage before, or, this setting or person seems familiar. Those issues did not creep into my reading of this book with great frequency, most likely because I kept thinking, "There is NO way he'll get out of this" or "That would never happen."  I realize that reading a good novel, and especially a "spy" novel requires a fair amount of suspension of belief.  However, this one passed those limits 
 I was looking for more information.  Thought it was over priced for what I got 
 I was disappointed and disgusted with this book.  The goal of the book was to create a darker retelling of the Snow White tale.  I thought the characters were completely unsympathetic, which is why I disliked it so much.  If the characters were more lively maybe it could be better.  For all of the violence and sex the book was strangely apathetic.  Well, I now know dark fantasy is not for me 
 I bought this book in order to self-teach, and many of the examples were confusing and seem to assume the reader already has a strong background in calculus. I then went ahead and took a calc I class that used Larson's Early Transcendentals, which was much clearer and easier to follow. My calc II class used Stewart's text, but since the homework was uncollected I just skimmed Stewart's text while doing the homework out of Larson's text since it was a better educational tool for me, and I got A's in both calc classes I took.  I did, however, go back to Stewart's text and solutions manual to get some additional practice doing proofs. It provided plenty of practice problems, but its explanations were not helpful to me because they tended to skip steps 
 I'm going to go against the grain and say this disc is better suited for a hi-rez on-hold playlist for a bank.  I am not a huge smooth jazz fan, but after reading the reviews about this DVD-A disc I figured I'd give it a shot.  Yes, from a fidelity standpoint this is top notch.  But I couldn't get past a minute of any of the songs.  Long story short, there are tons of great DVD-A and SACD discs out there.  If ultra-smooth jazz is not your thing, don't bother with this one 
 This book is required for my finance class. However, this book doesn't explain the concepts well. For example what the book covered on the chapters have nothing to do with what were asked on the exercises. Students are often left in the dark trying to find themselves to come up with the formula (luckily we have the internet). If you buy this book make sure you have the TI BA II plus calculator. The book ONLY explains how to do most of the problems on THAT particular calculator instead of giving us the formula to use on any other calculator or using spreadsheet. Although there are some chapters that mentioned they will give instructions on how to solve the problems using MS excel but so far only chapter 1 gave us some basic information and rest of the chapters don't show anything (even though they mentioned it). So the words on the book and what you are actually getting don't match. Unless you have a very good instructor who's willing to work without getting help from the book, you are pretty screwed.   This book needs some serious editing (as I said the words and the contents don't match). 
 Animals Animals - a richly illustrated, quality book of poetry - came out in 1989.  This one followed in 1991.  After reading it, I have the strong feeling that Eric Carle was pressured to do a companion volume and hastily threw this out onto the market.  The composition of the artwork is not nearly as strong as his other works; in fact, I would go so far as to say that this is his worst book.  The selection of poetry is meager and nearly all of the poems are dismissive of the creatures as silly or non-existent.  The subtitle of the book is "& other creatures which never were" which put my hackles up right from the start.  I don't think any of us have been around for long enough to judge what is "real".  Perhaps this is my Philosophy major talking.  Anyway, that coupled with the intro which is William Blake, "O!  how I dreamt of things impossible" and the conclusion page which is a quote from A Midsummer Night's Dream regarding the "weak and idle theme"... I cannot think of a more dismissive characterization of the rich legends held by many cultures around the world.  I was actually offended by this book and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  
 I tried 2 recipes from this book and was sufficiently disappointed that I will probably not use this book again. The "Four-Spice Fantasies" were completely bland and puffy/cakey in texture rather than chewy, while the "Oatmeal Cinnamon" cookies, though better than the former, were nothing to write home about. People should let me know if any of her other ones are worth trying.  Otherwise I now only go to allrecipes.com for user-rated recipes 
 Strange Candy is a collection of 14 short stories by Laurell K. Hamilton, author of the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter and Merry Gentry novels.  The first story in the book, "Those Who Seek Forgiveness" is, as Laurell puts it, "the first time Anita ever walked on paper for me." I hate to say it, but it's not that great a story. This is obviously Anita Blake Mark I. The character traits that would make Anita something special, the wit, the vicious sense of humor, the repressed sexuality, are nowhere in evidence - because they didn't yet exist in the author's mind.  Many readers will be shocked to discover "Those Who Seek Forgiveness" was the template for much of Laurell's short novel Micah. I said good things about Micah upon its release. I would have been less impressed had I known how much of it was a retread. The basic plot of Anita being hired by a murderer to raise the zombie of their victim, the zombie breaking free of Anita's control to attack their killer, Anita flung through the air to crack her head on a gravestone, being knocked unconscious, waking up at the end of the story in a hospital bed after her client's death, all were lifted from "Those Who Seek Forgiveness".  The rest of the stories are mostly forgettable, about half-and-half not-very-fantastic fantasy and not-very-horrible horror. There's a reason Laurell K. Hamilton is not known as a great short story writer: she isn't. Overall her characters are cardboard, she hasn't the gift of sketching a believable, sympathetic personality in the few strokes allowed within a short story's limited word count. There's rarely a sense of real peril involved in the problems her characters face. The stories come across as unsatisfying, by-the-numbers exercises in which "people" you don't care about go through the motions of adventures that don't involve.  One irritating thing about the stories in Strange Candy, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the order in which they're presented. For instance, there are two stories starring Sidra Ironfist set in Laurell's Nightseer universe. But why the hell is Sidra's first-ever appearance presented **after** the follow-on story?  We're almost through the book before we hit a real winner, "Here Be Dragons". And Here Be One Hell of a Story. It's shocking, after wading through so much dreck, to suddenly hit one of the neatest, most vicious little psychological horror pieces I've ever experienced. It's like reading the work of a completely different writer. If every story in Strange Candy was of the quality of "Here Be Dragons" this would be a 5 star collection.  "Winterkill" which is also set in the Nightseer world, is, surprisingly, pretty darn good. Other than "Here Be Dragons" it's the only decent story in the collection, in my opinion. I found myself liking and rooting for main character Jessa - which, considering she's basically a killer-for-hire is a great accomplishment on the writer's part.  Strange Candy is bookended by two Anita Blake tales. It begins ith "Those Who Seek Forgiveness" and ends with "The Girl Who Was Infatuated With Death" which takes place within continuity just before the novel Narcissus in Chains. As with so many recent Laurell K. Hamilton tales, "TGWWIWD" has a great set-up. Anita is hired to find a girl who is (a) dying of bone cancer and will in fact have her leg cut off in a few days, (b) about to be "turned" by a vampire, that very night, mostly so she can avoid the mutilation and painful death by cancer awaiting her otherwise. Problem: she's underage to legally make that choice. If the vampire turns her, he'll be up for execution. Does Anita "save" the girl from being turned - which legally is what she should do - knowing that by doing so she's condemning her to mutilation and, in short order, real death, or should she let it happen, knowing she's condemning the vampire? This presents Anita with a no-good-choices serious moral dilemma.  Unfortunately the great set-up soon gives way to zero forward momentum as the focus turns to - you guessed it - Anita's sex life. An over-emphasis on this one facet of Anita's life to the exclusion of plot has ruined every recent Anita Blake story, and it's no exception here. Thus, instead of bending all her efforts to finding the girl and the vampire in the few hours she has left, instead Anita spends the time playing footsy with Jean-Claude in his office at Guilty Pleasures while the police and other vampires do the job for her. Even Jean-Claude comments, "There was a time, ma petite, that you would have insisted on riding to the rescue yourself, questioning the girl's friend, and refusing to bring in the police at all." At which point I could not help but think, "Yeah, and wouldn't that be fun to read? There was a time this story would actually have been good."  Recommended for Anita Blake completists who absolutely need to own every word ever written about the character. Recommended for "Here Be Dragons" and "Winterkill". For myself this is a library rental, nothing more - a collection of mediocre short stories that just happens to contain one absolutely killer piece and one pretty good 
 This movie is watchable, but barely. Its not on the same level of the other chainsaw versions....and see leatherface as a....never mind, youll have to see for yourselves. We have a yound Renee Zellweger in this one.  
 I was really disappointed especially because I had read so many positive reviews of the book. It very boring and the only exercises there actually were was one little chapter. The book was more of an autobigraphy of the author as well as about the history of the acceptance of women's masturbation which I could have read online if i wanted to. I wouldn't consider this a self-help book at all.  
 This person is just trying to relive my memories from the past. I have ordered cartoons featuing the Loony Toons, Rocky and Bullwinkle, the Flintstones, etc. But this Pink Panther collection is BORRRRING!  
 The storyline is way over-the-top, the plot is very poor, the red-neck-America-knows-best attitude of the writer is funny and sometimes annoying. Still, I've red worse books. But not many. 
 Not much has changed from the original diet.  You might be able to stay on it for a week and loose some water pounds, but you will not be able to survive on this one. Look for something else if you want to loose weight that will stay off 
 I enjoy reading food narratives and childhood accounts of growing up in foreign countries; however, this book is quite a disappointment after reading the summary above.  The writing isn't great, the descriptions certainly don't transport you to Tuscany, and despite the title, I wouldn't say there is an emphasis on food.  If you were related to Patrizia, you mind find it an interesting read, but I've found myself skimming through it, searching for compelling passages, of which there are few 
 Alan Riding's book-length description of the people and culture of Mexico is as broad as the Rio Grande, as sprawling as the Sierra Madre, and as dry as Lake Texcoco. Dated, too, published in 1985, well before NAFTA and the collapse of Mexico's long-ruling PRI party, but what really hurts the readability of this book is Riding's total disengagement from the subject.  "At risk of caricature, a typical Mexican family can still be stereotyped," Riding writes. "The father is the undisputed figure of authority who has little respect for - or communication with - his wife. He expects to be served royally at home, but he spends much of his time and money drinking with friends or visiting his mistress. He pays minimal attention to his children, although he carries great importance to having a male firstborn who carries his name. The mother, rejected as a wife and a lover by her husband, tries to alleviate..."  Riding goes on like this for a while, but I won't. What really annoyed me about "Distant Neighbors" aren't his generalizations (they may be perfectly valid) but the tone of jaded detachment behind it. He might as well be tracking hippos in Zambia for all the passion he derives from his subjects.  Another thing I had trouble with: What exactly is "Distant Neighbors" about? The title seems to suggest the relationship between Mexico and the United States, and he starts in that vein noting how odd it is two such different countries share so long a border. But the theme isn't carried through the rest of the book, which deals just with Mexico. The idea then seems to be the "distant neighbors" of class, beliefs, and ethnicity that divide this closely-packed country. If so, it is not drawn out.  Riding covers a lot of ground, though more with dates and statistics then by capturing the voices of real Mexicans. When he finally returns to the subject of Mexican-U.S. relations in the last fourth of the book, it's a well-observed narrative with striking observations, like how deep the wounds of the Mexican War still penetrate the Mexican psyche and how badly Mexican President Lopez Portillo got on with U.S. President Carter. Oddly, Lopez Portillo was friendlier with Carter's successor, Ronald Reagan, despite the wider gulf in their ideologies; Riding notes deftly how this bespeaks a certain divide between rhetoric and reality where Mexican politics are concerned.  But for the most part, "Distant Neighbors" is a relentless, reflexively pessimistic book. "The system has in fact never lived without corruption and it would disintegrate or change beyond recognition if it tried to do so," he writes, as if one would be as bad as the other.  Worse, it lacks a sense Riding really invested himself of where he lived and worked for years as Mexico City bureau chief for the New York Times. Timesmen like Hedrick Smith ("The Russians") and Thomas Friedman ("From Beirut To Jerusalem") managed to produce books about past beats that give the reader a real flavor, and even zest, for the places and the people they describe. Riding, by contrast, gives you the feeling he couldn't wait to leave Mexico. In his hands, neither can you 
 If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever. What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.  McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore. 
 My god man. How much fluff can you put into one book. Mr. Hornblum, I have so much information to attain and so many books waiting on a list to be read that anything with useless time wasting fluff, aka long drawn out paragraphs, automatically goes on my "how not to write a book" list. I am sorry but your book made me more frustrated than enlightened, with all of your redundant repeats of what people said, told in eight differing ways, I am not sure if you thought the audience needed this much repeating or if you just needed to add a couple 20 pages to the final draft for appearances. But nonetheless I cannot sit and waste my precious time reading words of nothingness when there is an eternity of usefull information sitting out there waiting for me. *No arrogance intended, "I" as in us, humans.* I just don't see any excuse for this. Out of the 100% of book I would say there is about 25-35% of usefull concise information in it. Au Revoir 
 This is the first book by Shaara I have read. And, if his other works are like this, it is also the last.    On the cover, J. Persico is quoted as saying Shaara makes "literature read like history and history read like literature."  He goes on to claim that Shaara brings the war to "pulsating life."  I have even read a review that claimed this book was better than Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front.    I must have been reading a different book.  The first chapter, The Replacement, is a great short story.  After reading it, I had hight expectations for the book.  Unfortunately, it falls apart after that great beginning and it is a dull affair that completely lacks any sense of a coherent narrative from a literary point of view.  And, the history reads like an 8th grade textbook.   His narrative style is unable to give life to people that actually lived.  They are flatly presented and there is no sense of really caring about what happens to them.    After the dislocated short story of the first chapter, the book delves into a long-winded story of the flying aces, interspersed with summaries of historic events that do little more than ruin the flow of the story.  It frequently feels like the book is written for people who are unwilling to read a real history book.  Shaara doesn't even begin dealing with the trench warfare of the war until the 1918's, when the Americans arrive, focusing, as I noted before, primarily on the air war that occurred in the first years of the war. I should point out that the air war would be interesting reading in a book of its own.  Here, however, it seems more to reflect that the author did not deem the ground warfare fought by non-Americans worthy of a story. Or was too lazy to research the events enough to write about the ground war from the British or French perspective.   And, I have no particularly problem with him focusing on the American perspective on the war, but then why bother with writing anything prior to our entry?  I suppose a smaller book doesn't sell as well.  For those interested in historical fiction, I would recommend Bernard Cornwall's work.  And, perhaps, Shaara can learn a bit from him 
 In the 80's, after Cats became the phenomenon it became, commercials for newly-opened Broadway musicals would often feature an audience member enthusiastically exclaiming "It's Better than CATS!" Just from watching these commercials, some of which where for Stinkers like QUILTERS, it would appear that anything was better than CATS. This video proves those commercials right. Anything IS better than Cats.  What can one say about CATS? Tony Kushner sums it up pretty well when he has a character in his opus ANGELS IN AMERICA proclaim faux-enthusiasticly that "It's about Cats! Singing, Dancing Cats!" That's pretty much all to it. Sure, there's a shoestring plot (a tribe of cats have gathered together to decide which one of them gets to go to Kitty Heaven and get reincarnated. Or something. And somehow it won the Tony award for best Book of a musical), but CATS is one irrelevant song away from a musical review. About a dozen cats get a number about how special they are: This one is a magician, that one works on a train, another is some sort of master Criminal. At random points, they stop to dance irrelevantly and, at one point, have what a friend referrs to as "a cat orgy".  Taken at face value, such an evening couldn't be more than a train wreck.  But CATS somehow draws you into it's world, for better or for worse. In the case of this video, however, it is definitely for worse.  CATS may prove magical in a live performance, but this video falls to capture even a shred of whatever attracts the audience to it onstage. The video direction and lighting reduces the magical junkyard set of John Napier into a garish, tacky Vegas spectacular (though some would claim that CATS is little more than that to begin with) and the choreography of Gillian Lynne, highly praised in the original London and Broadway mountings, seems amateurish and ugly onscreen. Without the crucial distractions of good direction and beautiful sets, the glaring flaws  in Andrew Lloyd Weber's score comes hurtling to the forefront of the conscious mind: repetitive, overblown and dull.  I'm not sure who's fault this is: The video Director's, Lynne's, or Lloyd Weber's, but it leaves a black hole in the center of the video.  You can do nothing but pity the poor actors involved, some of whom are very good: Michael Gruber dances well, sings well and brings the right gravitas to the tribe leader Munkustrap, Jo Gibb and Drew Varley are an engaging pair of cat burglars (get it?) and Jacob Brent has a fantastic dance turn as the Magical Mr. Mistofelees. Also deserving mention are the duo of Aeva May and Rosemarie Ford, who sexily croon  "Macavity", a jazz duet about a cat who is the "Napoleon of Crime", like nobody's business.  Best of all are two older members of the cast: Elaine Paige as the tragic Grizabella and Sir John Mills as Gus the Theater Cat. The 90-year old Mills charms everyone off the stage and sings (in a beautiful quivery tenor) with an earnestness that brings a tear to your eye, and Paige, the originator of her part, belts out the one listenable song, the famous "Memory" with aplomb.   The third senior cast member, Ken Page as the patriarch Deuteronomy, has little to do but sit and look magisterial, which he does well.  But on the other hand, John Partridge shakes his tail as The Rum Tum Tugger (an Elvis spoof) without an inch of sex appeal, and Susan McKenna is cloying and cutesy as the motherly Gumby Cat. Few of the other felines make any impression.   However fine CATS  may be onstage (and even that is debatable), this video is a dismal failure, capturing none of the magic and all of the silliness of musical theatre. It's things like this that give musicals a bad name. If I were you, I'd pretend you are a mouse and run far, far, away from these CATS. 
 Just another one of those low budget, stupid stoner movies. My buddy let me have it for a day, and I was pretty bored watching it. There were a few funny scenes, but for the most part a very crummy movie. Nothign Nothing like Cheech and Chong. Don't waste your money

 I had to read this for a class, and I found it atrocious.  Everyone in my class seriously wanted to send a letter to Catherine Albanese to let her know how offensive and ridiculous this book was.  I had to restrain myself.  The information she gives is occasionally helpful, but usually skewed.  She covers a vast array of topics without really doing a good job with any of them.  I wish she had reorganized the book a lot and provided better information and less of her own opinions.  This was a waste of my time and money, and as soon as I was done with it, I sold it online.  I hope none of you bought it 
 this, to me seemed a copy of this authors previous books the same old same old. I attend Oxford  and as an exchange programme I had to pick one author actually the aut was picked for me. I personally dont enjoy reading the  experiences of someone who is writing fact as fiction. then I met the  author at a book party and she was so haughty and unapproachable, to a  female  but all eyes to the males .....if you know what I mean. Luckily  that same week I met  Styron and William  Buckley, so my time here in the  states wasnt a total loss 
 There isn't a fact or bit of advice in this poorly written book that you can't easily find and read on the Net for free. Written by yet another patient that thinks she can write and has something to say 
 I bought this book about 3 months ago, and I've only read through it once and then tired of it.  The drawings are almost too comic book-styled which is not what the beginner should look for in a book when first starting to draw people.  A beginner needs to learn how to draw realistic people and then they can go on to comic book drawing once they've mastered that.  I found this book lacking in description for some very crucial parts of the human body, which disappointed me greatly.  I expected there to be a section dedicated strictly to the torso of the body, but instead he scattered the information on the torso throughout various parts of the book.  He didn't even describe how to really draw the pelvis correctly and he never pieced together the entire torso to show you how to draw it as a whole.  This type of "unorganized" and "lacking" format was also found in other areas of the book such as drawing the chest and shoulders, which should be subsequent after one another.  Overall I would not recommend this book if you want to draw realistic figures.  This book does not teach any of the basics of human anatomy drawing, such as gesture drawing, which is very important in developing good figure-drawing skills.  Though this book is an anatomy book, it should atleast include some information on gesture and contour drawing-line drawing.  This book "might" be suitable for comic-book artists, but not if you're looking to draw realistically.  Plus, the format is rather hard to follow and practice.  If you're a beginner to figure drawing and portraiture, or if you're a little close to the intermediate level, I strongly recommend "Drawing the Head and Figure" by Jack Hamm.  I've been drawing from it for just a couple of days and I'm already seeing improvement.  Get it, you won't be disappointed 
 I thought it was me until I read several other reviews of Predator.  Ms. Cornwell can do so much better than this disjointed mess.  If she's going to continue the Scarpetta series, she needs to get back on track, creating characters that we care about.  I finished this book as quickly as possible just to get it behind me.  What a disappointment 
 I liked this machine while it worked, but I started having problems finalizing discs a bit ago.  I got busy and suddenly the warranty was up, and then the other day, it just wouldn't turn on at all.  I had it for 15 months 
 Let's start with P52, that credit card sized piece of papyrus, thought to be the oldest surviving scrap of scripture of the Gospel of John.  Mr. Ehrman repeatedly mentions that it was found in a "trash heap in Upper Egypt."  In fact, Mr. Ehrman does this every single time P52 is mentioned.   To paraphrase Ralph Manheim, "It is the half educated writer, without clear ideas, who generally feels that to say a thing only once is rather slight."  Mr. Ehrman is much too intelligent to be doing this by accident.  Therefore I believe it is done with purpose, and done oddly enough, without seeming too concerned about in which city it was discovered.  According to Dr. Bruce Metzger, to whom Mr. Ehrman dedicates his new book,  Misquoting Jesus, that fragment "was purchased in Egypt as early as 1920, but it sat unnoticed for years among similar fragments of papyri."  Hey, I thought a trash heap was a mountain of garbage one finds in a landfill with vermin crawling about and seagulls flying overhead.  Now it seems to include any stack of papyri that may contain holy scripture.  If that isn't a giveaway, I don't know what is.  While Mr. Ehrman gleefully tears apart any possibilities that most of the apocrypha could have any credibility (he claims nearly all of them are fakes or forgeries, and probably correctly), he nonchalantly mentions off the cuff that all but seven of the New Testament books are forged as well (those seven themselves also being tampered with)  The latter is, I believe, the real purpose for writing this book.  Lacking the courage to make this the focused topic, he covertly "slipped it in."  Since then he has made it the focus of a book called Misquoting Jesus.   The tendency for conspiracy theory to emanate from Mr. Ehrman is common.  There can be many reasons why so many more recently hand copied manuscripts of the New Testament differ from the oldest ones.  Mr. Ehrman points to large political movements most often while ignoring some more obvious reasons.  Case in point:  the Gospel of Mark.  He says the earliest copies show Jesus reacting angrily to just about everything.  Reasoning that the older versions must be the correct ones, Mr. Ehrman assumes the newer copies were purposely changed in order to sound more like Matthew, Luke, and John.  Could it actually be possible that these oldest copies have survived through the ages because it was known back then that they were wrong?  Consider that a scribe or two might've thought that a "compassionate" Jesus was rather wimpy and so rewrote Him to be angry all the time to show a more powerful God.  These "angry" copies were then set aside by church elders from the other often read "compassionate" copies and preserved for any number of reasons, perhaps as examples of bad behavior by "foolish knaves."  While the correct copies were handled so much that they fell apart and were discarded.  Just look at your own bookshelf.  The books that last the longest are the ones read the least.  It is an incorrect assumption on Ehrman's part that the oldest known copies were the only copies written at that time.    Regarding the differences among the four Gospel accounts:  If scribes were so prone to make the Gospels sound alike by changing them, why after 2,000 years and countless hand copied manuscripts are there still differences in accounts of events, such as when Jesus died in relation to the timing of the Passover meal or what garments were found in the tomb after the resurrection?   Also, could some of those "lost Christianities" which competed with what Mr. Ehrman refers to as the prevailing "proto-orthox" views have failed the test of time simply because they were wrong?  And if history is suspect anytime it is "written by the winners," schould we also be inclined to doubt the holocaust or the failure of Soviet Communism?  Perhaps Mr. Ehrman thinks that slavery got a "bad rap" from an historical perspective.  Maybe he will start rooting for the Chicago Cubs.  One can only wonder.  In defense of Mr. Ehrman, I will say that his writing style is engaging and lively, and not totally without fact.  But he does give away his agenda at times, which makes me question his credibility. While he is no Dan Brown, who still stands behind falsehoods to bring Jesus "down to our level," Mr. Ehrman seems to have an agenda he doesn't wish to share with us in his book.  It is not uncommon for secular Bible scholars to attack the KJV simply to shake the foundation of the "religious right."  After hearing Mr. Ehrman interviewed on NPR, that is exactly what I think he's doing.  It is expected that a growning number of "secular fundamentalists" will applaud anything that contradicts the New Testament, rejoicing in not having a God looking over their shoulders and telling them who they can and can't sleep with 
 I was looking for a book that showed how to make a cake to look like a character, not how to make a character for the top of a cake.  I was disappointed 
 Absolute bore.  I understand book of such caliber probably shouldn't be literally interesting, but it's bore.  I am happy I became Christian before reading this book.  Please, understand me right, I am not against it-its just, I can't read it to the end, it is absolutely uninteresting book.  Moreover, author tries enforce his particular view of Christianity on a reader.  In a way, I feel that book of such caliber should be necessary read for a Christians who want to go to some kind of biblical school.  They may see if they are ready personally for Christian academics.  Knowing about Christ by heart and trying to learn about Him theologically and academically can be two very different things.  Everyone on Earth are ready for the heart approach, I doubt though you won't be disappointed if you choose to learn about the Way and Christ academically.  It's hard; it's not for everyone.  It may even damage your zeal for Christ.  Definitely not for me.  (Maybe I need Theology book by another author though, ha, ha. 
 In his frequent jousts with critics and reviewers, MacDonald always takes the stance that his books do not justify anti-semitism; they merely describe it as a scientifically understandable, indeed predictable, response to certain supposed Jewish traits that he has identified as elements of a long-term Jewish evolutionary strategy.  (Many of these criticisms and rejoinders can be found on his own website.)  In other words, he is claiming the neutrality of an investigating scientist, and always acts offended when people accuse him of racism or anti-semitism.  If that's the case, why is he a frequent contributor to The Occidental Quarterly?  That journal's own statement of principles says, first, that "the West is a cultural compound of our Classical, Christian, and Germanic past," and, second, that "race informs culture."  (You'll also find, under principle 4, the lovely statement that "the European identity of the United States and its people should be maintained.")  Case closed.  This is an educated racist who is dressing up his bigotry in pseudo-academic language; all he means to say is that Jews have brought on their own persecution.  And I'm shocked that he has taken in so many readers.  Shame on Praeger for publishing these books 
 I've broken a few corks with this tool, as the "worm" doesn't reach the bottom of some corks. Other foil cutters are easier to use. Like most OXO tools, this one feels comnfortable and steady in the hand. If you're opening an older bottle or one that has a particularly long cork, use another corkscrew 
 I was really looking forward to using this book on our next trip to Paris, until I read the section in which it defines Jean-Marie Le Pen's Front National party as an "extremist, racist party". I mean, after the events over the past year (car burnings, riots, cartoons, etc) it would behoove Mr. Steve's to pray that Le Pen's party wins the next election, or he will be writing a book on how to speak Arabic instead of Frenc 
 I buy many audio CDs to listen to in my car during my commute, most of which are motivational in nature.  I was extremely disappointed in Jim Rohn's CD.  I cannot understand HOW this man could be a public speaker.  He has the most annoying voice I have ever heard!  This CD has both live recording and an in-studio section.  His voice is not nearly as annoying during the studio recording.  I could have excused his voice if the content of the CD had anything at all interesting to say.  It is very repetitive, slow, and says absolutely NOTHING.  If I could return it, I would.  Stay away from this one 
 Alot of the same info.Which has already been written before in previous American books 
 I was so disappointed with this book. As an animator I bought this book hoping that it would give me some idea about how to start producing my own short films and becoming an independant animator, but I soon discovered that the book had nothing to offer and the authors had no clue at all what problems animators faced in producing their own films. 
 This book is garbage. It does nothing but bash Israel for defending itself  aganist a Fundamentalist band of murderers. Hezbollah is not fighting some oppresve regime but are simply terrorists who are looking to spread the word of  Khomeini. Hezzbollah is willing to spread his techings through any means,even if that means sucide bombings. She  sheds no light into the groups inner workings and very little into the groups history. The book is simply a mass of anti israel rehtoric 
 First of all, I can't believe Trace got better reviews than Predator.  Predator was 1000 times better, but that's still not saying much.  Trace was just awful.  The worst in the series.  I can say with the certainty of the Great Scarpetta, that Patricia Cornwell did not write this book. One of her ghostwriters, who probably hates Scarpetta, wrote it.    This book is incomprehensible.  The story lines are disjointed, disconnected--just plain bad.  There is no follow through; the reader doesn't get the satisfaction of having everything tied together at the end.  What happened to Pogue?  Dr. Paulsson?  Mrs. Paulsson?  Dr. Marcus?  And what about Fielding? All of a sudden Fielding has a horrible skin condition and he's no longer in great shape and good looking.  Is this all because the Great Scarpetta was fired and moved away and the stress of life without her has ruined his physical appearance?  That's pretty riduculous. And the motivation of the killer is so weak and SOOOOO absurdly stupid, that I can't believe that Patricia Cornwell approved this awful imitation.   I'm so SICK to death of Lucy and her bad relationships, and I just can't stand Rudy. Also, in this book Lucy's father is now Cuban, instead of Brazilian, like he has been in the 12 previous books.  This ghostwriter has obviously never read any of Cornwell's Scarpetta novels.  Cuba and Brazil are two totally different countries and cultures!  To me, this is a huge oversight.  A good author takes note of every detail of the characters s/he creates, and I'm pretty sure that Cornwell isn't careless.  I digress...And then there's Benton and Kay, back together and back into the swing of their passionless, unfulfilling relationship.  Do they even like each other?  There's such tension and animosity between them.  Especially since Benton was never really dead; he was just undercover.  That whole story line was never explored in this horrible book. Even more evidence of poor ghostwriting--that was the greatest oversight. There's no hashing out of feelings and talking things through. All we're left with is Benton's five sentence explanation in Blow Fly. And Marino...I was horrified and acutally felt embarrassed when I read the part of Scarpetta taking pictures of Marino's injuries.  I don't want to give it away, if you haven't read the book.  That part is humiliating.  If you are a Scarpetta fan, you'll read this book despite the bad reviews.  In fact, you have to read it because you have see for yourself how truly terrible it is.  Just don't buy it.  Borrow it from the library 
 Boring!! I was disappointed.  In fact, I disliked it so much, I only finished about 3/4 of the book.  That is very uncommon for me as I alway push through as I want to give the author a chance to turn it around.  I just could not do it with this book 
 Astonishing that these highly educated authors have no idea what opportunity cost is.  Their method of analysis is completely invalid; the market timer should not have the ability to double up on his investments if the regular investor cannot.  If you can only save $1000 per month, how can you be investing $2,000?  The answer, of course, is by borrowing money.  Once you factor in the cost of borrowing that extra money into the authors' scenario, the entire market timing system collapses.  It's also astonishing that the authors point out but gloss over the fact that their system would have kept your money out of the market for the past 20 years.  Despite the bear market of '00-'02, the past two decades have been one great time to be in stocks 
 If it wasn't for the fact that I listened to the audio book version during my daily commute to work, I probably would have abandoned this book halfway through.   The end is confusing, and I'm left wanting more, not in a good way 
 NO REAL ANALYSIS, UNSUBSTANSIATED, TOO MUCH HYPE AND SELF PRAISE. NOTHING MORE THAN AN AVERAGE TRADER KNOWS ALREADY BY EXPERIENCE. JUST A INTERESTING OBSERVATION, NO RIGOROUS PROOF, OF NO REAL PRACTICAL USE 
 For puzzle lovers, when we opened the puzzle the pieces were not glued correctly they were all uneven thicknesses.  Puzzle was cute, but not very sturd 
 I think the movie has potential but ends up taking a childish turn in the end. I agree mostly with the points Mike Leonard makes in his review right here, only my final conclusion is quite more negative. The dvd image looks good for a movie shot in video like this, but it's not anamorphically enhanced, despite what the cover says, so be warned if that's important to you 
 Avoid this at all costs.  This is one of the worst films ever made.  Absolute, dreadful (...).  For a slasher/horror flick their's not much killing or gore... untilt he very end.  So you have to sit through an hour and a half of hilariously confusing monologues to get to the good stuff.  The sotry doesn't make sense and the acting is ridiculously over the top (this is Children of the Corn part 6, not Schindler's List).  Watch parts 2, 3, and 7... those are fun, gory, entertaining, well made (ok 3 and 7's FX (...)) flicks.  Avoid this film like the plague 
 If the author had spent more time telling us about Detroit and less time telling us how literate he is then it would have been a lot better book 
 Yes, it is pretty. No, it is not a good teapot. I have made tea for over 40 years, in all sorts of pots, and this is right up there with the worst. It drips A LOT! Perhaps those who think it does not drip were just looking at the spout. And no, it does not drip from the spout. Rather, lots of tea runs down the underside of the spout and ends in a big puddle under the pot.  This happens with both fast and slow pouring, with full and near empty pots.  This teapot will most likely have to become a pretty red flowerpot. Just too much mopping up 
 What a piece of crap!  I agree with the overall point the authors attempted to make, but they spent so much time bashing humans while offering so little support for their argument that I want to disagree.  The authors should stick to something they know something about 
 We were so excited to order this item. Sadly the quality is very poor. We have had it set up for less than a week and the front "counter" has broken off and one of the front panels has had a leg rip off. My kids love the idea of this item but it is extremely flimsy particle type board -it has basically disintergrated berfore our eyes . Even with general play it sways back and forth, a little scary if little ones are playing in it.I am going to call the maker - hopefully we can repair this (... 
 What's here is good, but there isn't very much material, and it's not at all comprehensively presented 
 Don't waste your time with Rich Woman. Just read Rich Dad Poor Dad. The book Rich woman is nothing but a advertisement for their books and seminars. F 
 First of all I thought Sat radio advertised " Commercial Free radio" was that. IT IS NOT AT ALL!!!! In fact I spend most of my time looking over the 160 chanels for something not with commercials. (...). They claim they have nothing to do with that. So this is a good buy IF you want another radio player WITH commercials (  A lot of them ) and to pay for it. I got this because I was tired of radio commercials and awful radio announcers who talked over songs and too much. Well sattelite radio is the same thing just with cussing. So keep this in mind before you buy. 
 I have no doubt that this book will come in handy for college level "calc" students looking for a refresher, but DO NOT confuse this as a "Calculus for Dummies" approach to the subject.  From the first couple of pages I felt as though I had been thrown in the deep end of the pool in order to learn how to swim.  I was anticipating a more accessible book and I was disappointed.  The examples of tomato sauce mold, rocket launched meatballs and giant pepperoni (don't ask) didn't serve to ground calculus in the real world for me.  Again, maybe a terrific text for people that already have a grounding in the subject, but hardly as comforting as the title would lead you to believe 
 I imagine this movie might be funny if you're really into dog shows.  I'm not, so I couldn't tell you.  Mediocre at best.  "This is Spinal Tap" was better 
 This was not what I expected at all,  its granules of silicone type stuff which makes the most unbelievable mess.  However,the kids however loved it! (They've never seen the real stuff.) I got fed up with cleaning them off and my kitchen surfaces and hid it in the cupboard in the end.  Save it for summer in the yard or deck!  Yuck! 
 An online review is a particularly inapt place to try to comment on the Logic itself - so I'll not do so.  I will point out, however, that this is the most poorly bound book I have ever purchased.  If one buys this book, chances are it will see some use - yet with even the most casual reading, the pages begin to separate from the spine.  Anything more than casual reading will see the pages plumb fall out.    While there's a certain amount of poetic justice to this - it's a reminder, a propos of Hegel, that the material instantiation will fall away, leaving the essential, conceptual core in its wake - that's cold comfort after paying $35.  I would recommend, if at all possible, that you try to find a hardcover edition 
 The author of this book describes it as "Lots of fun" but forgot to continue the phrase and include "for the demented" because personally for me this book was no fun at all. I mean compared to some of her other books this book is really bad. I liked Catherine Coulter and i like most of her books but this one...well i regret having wasted money on this one. so boring i didnt even finish it! The main trouble with this book is the dialogue..long and silly. the characters are realy not likeable at all -jack and Grey. Grey's reaction to JAck's stealing his horse was way too exagerated and hard to believe. I would have liked to finish this book but, frankly after threee attempts i gave up because its so boring and childish. Yes childish and if you read if for yourself you will surely agreee. The author clearly tries to be humourous...but, in my opinion does not succeed in doing so. A book is not made humourous just by putting stupid dialogue and a silly storyline. I made a mistake because i chose to ignore the other reviews which were posted here and bought it anyway : 
 I ordered this wagon for my granddughter's birthday, it showed up disguised as a skateboard ramp! She's only 1 year old, nice going aahhhggg 
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 Yeah, i bought this CD because i heard she is one of the better Drum N' Bass DJs....and she's really damn cute.  Problem is...this CD isn't very good at all.  Trying to go too main stream popish, some of the lyrics are laughable, there isn't a single song on this CD that would make it into one of my sets.  I'm sure she's a very good DJ, but someone led her down the wrong road this time 
 I am by no means a math wizard.  I am, however, able to learn things on my own fairly well.  This book makes that nearly impossible though.  This book gives very few examples, and the few that they do give rarely give any clues to what needs to be done to solve the equations.  It also fails to really teach anything.  It's by no means for a student that is going to be going through an online course where they won't be interfacing with an instructor.  I would not have enrolled into the course for online schooling if I had know this books was going to be this terrible.  I strongly don't recommend this book!! 
 This book does not compare with 1) Atlas Shrugged, or 2) The Fountainhead.  In my opinion, those are two of the finest books ever written.  If you haven't read them, put We the Living aside and read them now.  I could not finish We the Living.  I got sick of the stupid relationship.  I guess I got about 1/4th the way through.  Maybe my tastes are changing 
 I know that this was a memoir, but at one chapter, the title is definately misleading, and many of the goals and events received highly biased coverage.  Ms. Zia begins with a survey of history of how Asians were treated in America.  While I agree that the treatement was not ideal and certainly horrific by today's standards, there is absolutely no historical context here.  Unfortunately, Blacks were treated MUCH worse.  Catholics were vilified far before Asians were, and for much longer.  The way she presents things, you would only think that Asians were getting the short end of the stick.  She also harps on the lack of positive images of Asians in the media.  She self selects a small sampling, while there has been an increasingly large number of positive Asian role models in American culture.  Do the Italians whine when most Italian characters in media culture are mobsters?  She even imagines slights where they don't exist - for example, Sulu in Star Trek.  He was hard working to be sure (not that there is anything wrong with that), but as any fan of the series will tell you, he DID have a swashbuckling side to him.  If there is anyone who was emotionless and hard working, that would have been Spock, played by a white.  Besides, Sulu eventually made captain of the best vessel in the fleet.  So much for a negative image.  She gets into the issue of ethnic casting, focusing on Miss Saigon.  Well, it works both ways.  If only Asians can portray Asians, then Asians shouldn't portray whites either.  Too bad Lucy Liu.  Her character in Charlie's Angels was WHITE in the series, but was made half-Asian in the movies.  Opps, Lucy isn't even half Asian.  I would like to see Helen come over here to Asia to complain about the negative images of foreigners.  How many negative images of foreigners exist in Hong Kong and Japanese movies?  There was an advertising campaign here in Taiwan where a company had three white men in jail costumes after being arrested.  Foreigners are constantly portrayed by media outlets in several Asian countries in a negative light.  Why can't you get on your soapbox about that?  She comments on how many Asians are complemented on their English even if they have been in the U.S. their whole life.  Well, how many people who look white in Asia have been here their whole lives, but are still referred to as foreigners?  It works both ways Ms. Zia.   She also gets into her homosexuality.  What does THAT have to do with Asian American Dreams?  Like most Americans, those of Asian descent are opposed to homosexuality.    Finally, there is the notion of hyphenated Americanism (though she technically doesn't succomb to it because the omits the hyphen.)  She wants Asians to be treated as equals in America.  I have no problem with that.  I would like to see the same thing.  However, when you put your ethnic homeland BEFORE American in what you call yourself, how do you think you will ever be accepted as truly American 
 While I like Dr. Laura & think a lot like her I'm afraid she missed the mark with this CD/Book. I've enjoyed most of her other books but didn't find this one particularly helpful or interesting.  The CD version of the book basically spends hours telling you to get over your bad childhood & move on. It's rarely that easy. The only part of the book I found intersting was Dr. Laura's synopsis of her bad childhood. I think she should write an autobiography 
 It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.  It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends?  I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something.  
 D&G is one of the top five brands but this book made me cry from disappointment. The book is very small and does not have many pages. The book begins with a "Dolce & Gabbana Glossary." The glossary has words like, "Animal Print," "Black," "Tank Top," etc. I know what the color "black" is. Apparently the author assumes the reader is stupid and does not know what the color black is.  The pictures are a big mound of doo doo. All the pictures (with the exception of two) are in black and white. (The other two pictures of a yellow color).  Almost ALL of the great pictures can be seen in "10 years of Dolce & Gabbana." I recommend that book over this one. Also, the pictures in this book are not even great looking. There are no advertisements or pictures from the catwalk. Buy "10 years of D&G" instead and you'll enjoy it more 
 Got this book for my oldest daughter about a week ago and she reports the binding is very bad. Pages are falling out 
    I have nothing really against Jordan Rubin and this book. What it offers is common sense natural medicine. Nothing in this book is really a revelation or surprising. Most or if not all of the information can be found in other publications as is really nothing more than a compilation of other resources. The big issue here is Mr. Rubin's claims and other peoples claims of being "cured" or "healed" by chronic diseases. This is simply wrong, incorrect, inaccurate, and ignorant to say. Sure Mr. Rubin wants you to use his Garden Of Life products. They aren't cheap either. But to say that you will be "healed" or "cured"? These "products" just suppress the symptoms, which is great! But that should not make you stray away from seeing a medical doctor. Just because you used to have a diesase say like Diabetes does not mean it was cured. Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn Disease are the same way. They are always there. If people actually think that these diseases can be cured by Garden Of Life products they are gullible, sad, lost people. Using this system in conjunction with a doctor is the best way. I know some people despise doctors and are willing to shell out a lot of money for Garden Of Life products INSTEAD of seeing a doctor and that is just plain stupid. Wake up people. 
 Maxime Schwartz was a molecular biologist and is now a professor at the Pasteur Institute in Paris.  Schwartz traces the history of medical research into spongiform encephalopathies, and how the scientific understanding of how they are spread has changed over time.  If you know anything about Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) or Mad Cow disease, I don't think you'll learn anything new in this book.  How the Cows Turned Mad is not a sensational book, nor even a good book.  Quite simply it is too wordy and dull 
 What the cheeky Mr Duncan fails to grasp is that the Chinese and Japanese love collecting dollars, much like Americans love collecting baseball cards. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever to subsidize the rest of the world via minimum wage and universal fiat. As long as Mr Paulson makes frequent trips to China to make sure they're working hard and behaving themselves in the factories there's nothing to worry about.  Furthermore, his "analysis" rests flimsily on the work of the so called economists Ludwig von Mises and clever clogs Jacques Rueff. No wonder he is so confused.  Verdict:  Communist propagand 
 While the author's intentions are good, he has fallen in to the trap of seeing Hindu Dharma through the mirror of Christianity. A more direct look at the subject would have been better. This book has served its purpose few decades ago and is outdated now. I would recommend more recent book like "Idiot's guide to Hinduism" by Linda Johnsen. She has taken a more direct approach of explaining the conecpts in Hinduism 
 As a big Disney Princess fan, I'm rather upset that for this CD, the vocal versions of the tracks are NOT performed by the original voice actresses who played each Princess. It's almost like buying a karaoke CD with tracks of people singing along to the karaoke provided! Either include the original vocals for the song, or don't include them at all, Disney. 
 Really uncomfortable. I wore them twice and then threw them out. They sagged like a sad pair of tights you used to wear when you were little. And they became transparent like they were going to rip at any moment. Not worth the $5 I paid 
 I am disappointed in the size of these bowls. They are very small...the largest being approx 1.5 qt.  The description does not state the size and I needed much larger. They do seem to be made very well, though.  
 I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this book. This is one I won't pass on to or recommend to anyone. The messy dialogue itself is a reason to skip this one 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 I purchased four of these shot glasses. Of the four, one has tiny bubbles throughout, one has black specs in the glass, one has a bulge in the glass, and the last is taller than the other three.  The shape is beautiful, but with all the imperfections, I'd recommend something else.  My most disappointing Bodum purchase ever 
 I refuse to believe that Leon Uris truly authored this book. I suspect that in his declining years somebody took serious advantage of him and got him to sign his name to an abomination. Uris' previous works, such as Exodus, the Haj, and Battle Cry, are centered around complex, well-developed, dynamic characters and riveting plot lines. The premise of this book, namely, that in 2004 an assimilated, Irish Catholic politician would suffer prejudice because he is actually an adopted Jewish child, is frankly ludicrous. We saw in the last election a wide array of candidates fall over one another in an attempt to produce Jewish ancestors, shamelessly pandering to a mythically monolithic "Jewish vote" in a manner most Jews themselves found offensive. Joe Lieberman's Judaism was essentially a non-issue. The characters in "A God in Ruins" run from unbelievable caricatures (the Republican opposition candidate) to whiney nebisches (like the main character's wife). This book is virtually unreadable. It is a travesty that it is connected with the name of one of the greatest of 20th century authors. Please don't buy it. If you did buy it, please dispose of it. Let's all forget this book was ever written 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book. The author seems more interested in self promotion and only scrathes the surface of the subject matter. In my opinion not worth the money. 
 I have been a musician and writer for over 50 years, and glory of glories, in Whitney Balliett's book, American Musicians II, he achieves perfect pitch in his prose when capturing the heart and soul of what music is, and the men and women who make it happen. His stories pulse with an energy that is seemingly boundless.  Here is a man who has somehow gotten inside these legendary figures, some of whom I knew and many of whom I've heard in person. Balliett lets you listen through his own ears, giving you a guided tour not only of the notes on the page, and then as they take flight in the air, but also of the fascinating daily lives of these gifted individuals.  I can't play like Art Tatum, but Balliett lets me sit beside him as he lays down his "perfect storm" of notes, at the end of which is this huge rainbow whose image we carry in our mind forever.  If you love good music and good writing, you've come to the perfect book.  Balliet is no longer with us, but he has left us a legacy that should be treasured for 32 bars unto infinity.

 While I wouldn't expect a professional quality wheel for a child's starter toy, I would expect a wheel powerful enough to at least turn.  Even my daughter's 7 year old hands on a well wetted lump of clay proved too much resistance for this wheel.  It kept stopping dead at the slightest touch.  The lack of power will be frustrating to any child, and making a balanced bowl will be impossible. Kids would do better to form bowls by hand.  We took this toy back 
 This was a very annoying and boring flick thats barely watchable and throughout the film I kept looking at my watch, the film is not a historical drama nor is it an autobiographical film about William Shakespreare infact it is a romantic comedy disguised as a historical drama. My girlfriend insisted that we watch this film together but I wasn't in the mood she forced me to watch this, the film was about a struggling young writer Shakespeare played by Joseph Fiennes who falls in love with Lady Viola played by Gwyneth Paltro who also happens to inspire his famous play Romeo and Juliet, this film also won a couple of oscars including Gwyny for best actress but I felt like the film was just not that funny because all the characters seemed to talk in an old English style thats hard to understand. Overall the film was just O.K. I think that some of the sets and costumes were fantastic and Judi Dench was great as Queen Elizabeth but I never want to watch this film again, if your a Shakspeare fan and like romantic comedies then you might like this film more than I did. 
 While certainly a better presentation than the Rod Stewarts and Michael Boltons of the world and their flaccid stabs at music way different from a rocker's sensibilities, Buble is a standards singer for those who think Kenny G is a jazz musician and John Tesh is a pianist.  There's nothing 'wrong' with listening to him...there are just so many better alternatives.   It's the songs that are great, folks, not the singer. Seek out the people who recorded these songs in the first place, when they had REAL musicians and the best arrangers in the world working with them (a nod to Johnny Mercer, who provided some of Buble's arrangements.)  Want to know the keywords? Sinatra. Darin. Billy May. Nelson Riddle. Peggy Lee. Mel Torme. Tony Bennett. Keely Smith. Johnny Hartman. Anita O'Day. Diane Krall. Gordon Jenkins. Johnny Mercer. Cole Porter. Count Basie.   There are plenty more, but you can find them for yourself.  If you think Buble is Da Man, wait till you try Frank or Bobby Darin. You'll never look back 
 This book would be more for pretty inexperienced horse people just starting out.  I was hoping to find more on arenas and footing and things like that since I already have a barn and horse property and have had horses all my life but never built my own arena.  It was too basic for me 
 Mr.Macdonald is now in the company of the Nazis and the Islamofascists, of those who preach hatred of the Jews. True, he does not say this directly. But what he does in effect is try to argue that Jews are anti-Gentile, that this is the heart of their ' evolutionary strategy'(nu?) and that this leads to resentment hatred, and  murder of Jews. He in doing this ignores wholly the fundamental teachings of Judaism which teach that every human being is created in the image of God, and is thus of infinite value.  He ignores the fact that the most frequently mentioned commandment in the Jewish Bible is the one about honoring and respecting strangers because the Jews who were strangers in Egypt understand this kind of suffering.    He ignores the fact that among the great Jewish contributions to mankind is the idea of equality before the law.  And while ignoring the heart of Jewish teaching he also ignores the facts of Jewish history. If Jews are so ' successful ' in evolutionary terms why is it that the Jews who numbered five to eight million people , one out of every ten citizens of the Roman Empire today are less than two tenths of one percent of mankind as a whole. That is had the Jews simply grown at the same rate as the world's population they would be over two - hundred million today, and not around thirteen million.  Jews would not be the Chinese but they would be among the larger peoples of mankind.  Another important area of distinction which escapes the author is that between the actions of individual Jews and that of those acting for the benefit of the Jewish community. The great majority of ' prominent Jews' have no direct relation to action for the Jewish community. And as Hannah Arendt pointed out often their ' prominence' works against the Jewish community as a whole.  One more point. To talk about Jewish successful 'evolutionary strategy' in the same century when over one- third of the Jewish people were murdered is obscene. The Jews are the only people who have not replaced their losses from the time of the Second World War. So where is their ' evolutionary numerical success'?  On the other hand , the Jews can say that among their contributions to mankind is the transmission of the idea of One Creator God who relates to each individual human being with love and consideration. This teaching is however one which the author of this particular piece of hate- literature chooses to reject. Instead of this work I strongly recommend readers look at  works by two non- Jewish writers, Thomas Cahill's "Gifts of the Jews" and Paul Johnson's "History of the Jews" These works also have the advantage of being in readable prose 
 I loved Gilad from watching him on ESPN and LOVE the beach scenes.  However, I felt like he went too fast; I was playing catch-up because he switched from one thing to another very quickly.  There weren't a lot of repeats before moving on to something new.  Maybe if I did it more and got used to it, I wouldn't mind.  However, I much prefer my Kathy Smith and Cathe videos.  This one is just collecting dust for me right now.  Maybe I'll give it a try another time, but I regret buying it 
 I'm in despair. Hewitt's last book, Painting the Map Red, presaged the Republican loss of Congress. Now this, and my man Mitt is floundering at 3% in the polls. Hugh's books are becoming the official kiss of death for Republican politics. (Hey, Hugh, how about throwing a big fat literary kiss out to Obama next time?) 
 In 1998 I taught a class in medical technique for medical assistants. I had a text to teach yourself medical terminology. I went to Ingrin Medical book store and reviewed several books. I loved Harrison's book and it came in quite handy as I was hired by the hospital to manage their health care. The book is very portable and needs to be revised often as medical advances and new terms come into being. It is very easy to understand, as my degree was to work with elderly in need of managed health care 
 I LOVE Elizabeth Berg.  While this book was not her best, the story of the people about whom this was written was really amazing.  I just felt the book was boring, and I think it lacked Berg's wonderful prose and poetry on life.  I think she made one reference to life being like fabric on a sewing machine, slipping out of your fingers, or something like that.  I always love her comparisons like that, and this book did not contain much where I said "Wow - she is SO right!"  I also don't like books from a child's point of view.  I'm 41 and want to read from a woman's point of view.  If this is your first Elizabeth Berg book, do yourself a favor and go read something older by her.  She really is wonderful, and I look forward to her next novel 
 I'm a Pagan who, to put it very mildly, does not have a high opinion of the Old Testament.  But Thompson has managed to write something even worse.  It is one thing to point out that Biblical stories of the Exodus and the conquest of Israel by Joshua are contradicted by archaeological evidence (they are).  It is quite another to throw out genuine archaeological evidence as well as any connections to Biblical stories from the Book of Judges onwards, as though neither people nor history existed back then!    If folks want to say that there were ancient Israelites back in the 13th century BC, and have some evidence for it (including, say, Merneptah's Stele, which appears to refer to them explicitly), then right or wrong, that's scholarship.  If others want to say that the actual Israelites did not appear until the 12th or 11th century BC, and present some evidence for that (including explaining the Stele, of course), well, that's scholarship as well.  I'd refer interested readers to works such as "The First Historians" by Baruch Halpern (1988), "The Archaeology of the Land of Israel" by Yohanan Aharoni (1978) and "Who Were the Israelites and Where Did They Come From?" by William Dever (2003).  Thompson, however, is an anti-scholar.  He knows that people existed from the 13th through the 3rd centuries BC.  He knows there's enormous amounts of corroborating evidence about what those people were like.  And he's out to denounce anyone who says anything about them, no matter what they say!  It's simply ridiculous.    The claim that there were no such people as the ancient Israelites is not scholarly unless it is backed up by some rather striking evidence.  Thompson has nothing of the sort.    This guy is worse than the Bible-is-truth fundamentalists.  At least, those who believe the accounts in the Old Testament will get some of the later history right, once in a while.  Thompson, by denying that there is any truth anywhere, won't get anything right 
 I'm giving this book two stars instead of three because the author felt compelled to waste so much white space on her leftwing, feminist agenda.  Ms. Harwood has published several articles on the supposed sexism of Latin textbooks, and so litters her book with largely pointless textboxes containing "gender-specific historical tidbits" which she calls "Hysteria's Herstory." (Something tells me that doesn't have quite the alliterative ring the author intended.)    Likewise, what Ms. Harwood refers to as "the Christian Church" of the so-called Dark Ages is in reality the Catholic Church.  Presumably, the correct identifier didn't sit well with her progressive sensibilities.  For an agenda-free discourse on Latin, get the Dummies book or stick with Wheelock's Latin 6e 
 I have read other Susan Stephens books, and I just can't like them.  Even for shallow Harlequins, her books have been ULTRA shallow, and stereotypical...there's nothing new or fresh about this story.  The plot here basically is, a woman who's never had a great sexual relationship goes to Greece & finds one.    (By the way, Harlequin heroines ALWAYS have to go to Greece, or Tuscany, or Spain to experience great sex, because in Harlequin-world, gorgeous men=great sexual partners and same apparently don't exist in the U.S. or in England.  The rejected boyfriend/husband is generally English, & already married--to his mother.  Frankly, if I were an American male or an Englishman, I'd be kind of angry about these characterizations!)    The hero is alpha-male with a capital A, but gee, she kinda likes that, despite the protestations of modern-day feminism (the type of heroine who fights her attraction to the hero ...jeeest...enough...to get him thinking "she's different than all the rest", the rest being about a zillion other sexual partners in his past.  Such a very attractive thought!)    And of course, in typical Harlequin fashion, HE turns out to be worth billions.  If, as Harlequin writers would have us believe, there are so many rich guys masquerading as poor ones, I want to know why I'm not meeting these hidden billionaires on MY vacations?  (Could it really be that I'm not as attractive as I think I am?)    And, hey, wasn't THAT plot twist done like, 45 years ago, with the Yves Montand-Marilyn Monroe movie "Let's Make Love"?  Isn't it about time to give it a REST?  Take my advice & don't waste your time with this silly story.  Contrary to what you believe, I HAVE read some good Harlequin romances, but this ain't one of 'em.          
 I had high hopes for this nightlight after reading other reviews, but it isn't so hot. The light isn't very bright and quite diffused, and the light sensor isn't sensitive enough - it stays on in all but the brightest light. I ordered two, but have only opened one, and the other is likely to stay in its packaging 
 People, I love Covenant, they have become one of my favorite groups ever.  This is total tripe compared to everything else they have ever done.  It feels like they either gave up, or ran out of creativity.  If I was them I would be absolutely embarassed by this effort, because they are capable of soooo much more. The only track I like, and I really digit, is 20 Hz.  It is one of my favorite covenant tracks ever. Everything else? Garbage. Just being honest people, don't force yourself to like it just because it is Covenant 
 All sizzle and no steak.  I am a fan of Senge's initial work.  This one falls short of making a mark.  Maybe I expected too much.  In any regard, I felt suckered after getting half-way thru this thing and I quit. Hope you have a different experience 
 If you're interested in the basis for the Food Enzyme Concept, you will be better off with the original, Dr. Edward Howell's book, "Food Enzymes for Health and Longevity." Santillo's book is an enthusiastic abstract  of some of the highlights of Dr. Howell's work, but the details got a  little scrambled in translation 
 The shelf life for this brand of hatemongering is very short. And obviously Michelle knows this since she churns out error-filled polemics almost as fast as Ann Coulter.  The only people who buy, let alone read, this drek are already singing in Michelle's ever-dwindling choir.  Have fun ranting, folks. 
 This was a disappointment after hearing the fantastic Christmas Cocktails Pt1.  Not much new here -- have heard these same renditions on many other compilations 
 This is a short collection of essays given as papers at a conference at Seattle Pacific University.  The conference was sponsored by a C.S. Lewis Institute, and some contributions are reminiscent of the aggressive polemical style of that author's apologetics.  The opening two essays, by the editor and Peter Kreeft, are not concerned with discerning Tolkien's views of western civilization, but with using Tolkien to buttress their own views, a distinctly different approach.  And their definition of western civilization, for the purpose of their essays, is strictly confined to Biblical morality, with dire references to September 11 as proof of the reality of evil, and plenty of random bashings of anti-Tolkien critics, moral relativists, and other harbingers of the bad.  Kreeft claims that Theoden's virtue lay in avoiding Denethor's sin of acquiring too much knowledge, and that Gollum speaks in the plural because the singular, as in "I Am That I Am," is associated with God.  Some may find such claims seriously off-base: I certainly do, and had to grit my teeth through both his and West's essays.  [Contrary to the anonymous reviewer above, examples like these are totally out of keeping with Tolkien's own way of thinking.  There are many better books, by scholars such as Joseph Pearce and Matthew Dickerson, which demonstrate Tolkien's Catholic and conservative thinking in terms of Tolkien's own thought, rather than using Tolkien as a cudgel to randomly bash whatever the writer may not like about modern life.  Tolkien was never crude, and unlike C.S. Lewis he was not a polemicist in his public writings.  These authors are both.]  The third and longest essay, by Janet Leslie Blumberg, is a quiet discussion of the literary influence on Tolkien of Anglo-Saxon and Middle English literature.  Three very brief essays conclude by taking a more specifically theological and sacramental approach to Tolkien's morality.  Of these, Phillip Goggans follows Kreeft and West, but Joseph Pearce and Kerry L. Dearborn are more interested in exploring Tolkien's views than in using Tolkien to defend their own.  [Again, note the difference.  They explore Tolkien's views, rather than selectively and misleadingly quoting from Tolkien to defend their own views, which on specific matters Tolkien might or might not have shared.]  They and Blumberg provide workmanlike essays which, though they only skim the surface of their topics, can be useful as introductions.  This book is a thin softcover with large print, narrow margins, and numerous typographical errors 
 I find it much more difficult to navigate this book than, say, Moreland and Fleisher's book of Latin grammar. Furthermore, it's verbosity is frequently difficult to penetrate. The author seems to have an aversion to synthetic explanation, relying instead on an overabundance of examples that serve to clarify little of the readers confusion 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 Ridiculous, convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring.   Did Cornwell even write this one herself? If so, she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread: On page 216 Marino remembers Mrs. Paulsson greeting him at the door "wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater", but later when he tells Scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door.  Perhaps it was the author's attempt to let readers think Marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened. However, to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct 
 I was not into this movie at all.  My mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through.  A middle-aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life, so he takes a dance class.  Ofcourse there's a fine dance instructor, a crush is pursued, a wife gets jealous, hires a detective, and *gasp* his crush is found out.  The movie was too predictable and it just wasn't for me.  Not a bad movie, just not my cup of tea.  Richard Gere was cute as usual, which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end, besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since "So You Think You Can Dance" never had contestants who mastered it 
 This book is next to useless in helping students to understand fallacies and identify them.  It is probably the poorest instructional material I have encountered in all of my years in college. Humor was incorporated into this text in an effort to help students better understand the material, however, that effort is a big failure when it comes to this student, and probably also for many others.   Instead of helping, the humor detracts from the instructional value of the material and distracts the student rather than helping him or her to comprehend. Chapters 4, 5 and 6 deal with rhetoric and fallacies, however, I have found those three chapters to be the most incomprehensible and unhelpful chapters in the entire book.  I am glad I got a used copy of this book... it is certainly NOT worth the price tag placed on a new copy 
 100 Bullets had me very interested in the Vertigo comic series, that coupled with the fact the cover had quite nice art. Once I got in I found the concept to be pretty sound: Fairy tales characters all lived in a giant kingdom that was conquered so now they live in modern day new york. All the characters were there too... but despite all this Willingham decides to mess with original stories a bit to make things more interesting I suppose. That set me off from the begining.  I read on, hoping the end would justify the means. However, by the end of the book I felt all the characters were rather shallow, casting aside the myth behind them was fine, but not much work was done to build up the new characters beyond paper-cutter archetypes. I will try the second volume, but my hopes for this series have been violently dashed against the rocks 
 it is nice to have tab, with the notation.   there is no indication as to which version of the tunes he is trancribing , the title is a lie  there is no breakdown of the guitar style there just tunes trincribed period 
 This second book is even worse than the first. After her first book-which she ends with a cheap booze joke that mocks the whole field of Parapsychology-Mrs. Bielski is contacted by many people in the Chicago area who describe their paranormal experiences to her, only to have them whitewashed as folklore or myth. Mrs. Bielski's whole problem is, her mind is so filled with materialistic philosophy, she can't even understand human feeling when she sees it. Resurrection Mary is far more real than this phony. If you want your moneys worth of this book- take it with you to the toilet 
 The orchestrations and chorus present on all of the regular tracks intended to make him more palatable to a wider audience suck the soil right out of Ray Charles' performances.  This is particularly evident when you hear the bonus tracks.  The bonus tracks are fabulous, but I'm sure you can find them on another Ray Charles album 
 When the Shaggy Man asked the Scoodlers why they still wanted to eat him after they had just proclaimed their love for him, their answer was simple: "We love you in soup!"  Can someone -- anyone -- take a private interpretation of a word or phrase and then pawn it off to the public at large who will have a quite different understanding of what it means?  An MIT linguist should know that to twist a word or phrase ("failed state") into a private interpretation is lose intellectual coherency.  Understanding, if at all, comes not from the exposition itself but rather from interpretation of the words by the reader (e.g., the kind of understanding one gets from reading "Finnigan's Wake").  And such interpretations vary wildly among readers and are of no use to advancing a general understanding.  If you, as a typical left-wing anti-American, were to say to someone not so inclined that the U.S. is a "failed state," you will draw either a blank stare or laughter.  And either response is entirely appropriate.  However, Chomsky does not really emphasize the "failed state" meme.  It's used more a rhetorical flourish, much like his designation of the U.S. as a "rogue state."  No, the book's theme is that the U.S. is a bumbling, hypocritical, hegemonic power, constantly screwing up others' lives and getting burned from unintended consequences.  There is some small amount of truth in that unoriginal analysis, but Noam's anti-Americanism goes over the top.  There is no bad thing that's happened in the world, it seems, that the United States is not responsible for, including, of all things, the genocide in East Timor.  It's the failure to provide and discuss countervailing evidence or do a rational comparative analysis that turns the book into a screed 
 i was eagerly looking forward to catching up with this movie id missed at the time of its release, esp since im a fan of both edward norton and eddie furlong (even as just an acxtor, lol). however, this was an overwrought and overthought mess. there is nothing here that hasnt been covered (sans the dirty language) in a slew of tv movies dating back to the episode of "twilight zone" where dennis hopper met hitler. and a bald eddie furlong is not much fun to look at. norton is less and less interesting an actor as time goes along, but at least here he was still trying 
 I pre-ordered She's no Faerie Princess because the storyline seemed like something I would be interested in. Little did I realize how close this novel would resemble the Merry Gentry series. By the time the hero was introduced I found my eyes glazing over. The cover (not the author's fault), also has one of the ugliest couples I've seen. Who is the frizzy-haired middle-aged woman? Surely not the heroine. 2 stars. Not really able to maintain enough interest to finish. 
 Sickening.  It is clear that this book is from the anals of the classic "Blame the Mommy" era, when anything that went slightly wrong with a child was, of course, Mommy's fault!  Having pored through this book, and books like Dibs in Search of Self, I see red when Autism is referred to as a psychological disorder.  Bettleheim managed to ruin many a family by coldly claiming it was the fault of "refridgerator parents" where a normal baby gave up and withdrew, becoming autistic, but in the interest of history, and of the excuse "thinking of the times", they didn't have any clearer answers back then, and went with what they knew, hence the two-star rating instead of one.  Autism is a neruobilogical disorder.  Imagine yourself with your senses so hyper- or hypo-sensetive, and your ability to process that information curtailed and often painful or disorienting, and your life is reduced to vague, disconnected bits of events.  After reading books like Nobody Nowhere and Somebody Somewhere by Donna Williams, and Son-Rise: The Miracle Continues by Bears kaufman, even Let Me Hear Your Voice by Catherine Maurice, this is even more clear.  I am especially startled when I read Donna Williams' books.  She is a high-order autistic who spent the first four years of her life completely oblivious to the world around her.  She only forced herself to relate to the world as a sake of survivial, or she would never have come as far as she did.   (I have also known a high-functioning autistic or two who told me that doing stuff like rocking their heads back and forth or flapping their hands gave them great relief--it was predictible and they "lost themselves" in the motion--it soothed their hypersensitivy and kept their senses within tolerance levels.)  So perhaps for me it is not a big stretch of the imagination to see why autistic children often indulge in self-stimulatory behaivor.  A normal child locking himself into a world of bizzare ritualistic behaivors and oblivion to others around him doesn't do it to protest a cold unloving environment.  They truly cannot relate.  This book belongs on the history shelf, not on any psych shelf.  And yes, I do believe it is possible for an autistic child to recover, but not through psychoanalysis.  Early intervention is critical, but if done, increases chances a child can progress into societal norms, and even leave Autism behind entirely 
 I use the word stunningly only semi-figuratively. This book purports to be a series of diverse explorations of a great theologian and martyr. It is nothing of the sort. We hear nothing from reformed evangelicals who regard Bonhoeffer as virtually apostate. Instead we have a collection of essays written by those who claim to pass as Lutherans and Anglicans (there is I believe one Roman Catholic) whose next claim to fame after violating the kerygma of Christianity will no doubt be to announce with pride that they are baptizing Dolphins. Consider  the statement " People like Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi  illustrate what Bonhoeffer means (p 118) All one has to do is to read the first page of Bonhoeffer's Ethics to realize that hypothetically however much he may have admired them they represent exactly the OPPOSITE of what Bonhoeffer means. Bonhoeffer is a LUTHERAN and a conservative one at that but these writers are using Bonhoeffer to suit their own agendas (which they concede has often been done) Don't read this book--read The Ethics or Act and Being--notice the influence of Barth. Bonhoffer deserves better than to be left in the hands of the "Honest to God" people. It might also be good to have a look at what Luther said as well 
 I should have insisted on my money back the first time!  Within 10 minutes of opening our first shell shocker it jammed up and wouldn't work properly.  Since I had already spent the $[...]for the battery that can only be used in this toy I decided to try another one (after a long interchange with the Tyco people and a 6 week wait).  The second one finally arrived and once again, my son had it out of the box for not more than 15 minutes and it was obvious that it wasn't preforming as promised.  So, if you do choose to buy - make sure you save your receipts for the toy and the battery 
 ryan adams is no gillian welch.  his music is derivative, milk-toast tripe.  his watered down alt-country pop is a far cry from the wonderful artists that influenced it.  try the worst neil young record.  it will be more interesting than this 
  Unfortunately, this book says more about the author than the subject. If you want a book that demonstrates a problem, illustrates a potential solution and its applications; then don't buy this. This is a very personal and hence cloudy view of the subject matter. There is some useful information in this book but it is hidden behind the grand philosophical statements or buried in the foot notes.  Has this author ever met an empirical scientist, rather than mathematicians or philosophers. Scientists love measuring things. No scientist would ask the question 'Is an apple red or green?' They would pose the question 'How much pigment (in milligrams) of each of a series of colours does each apple have?' Or in truth something far more obtuse. In fact the fuzzy logic treatment would be a bit black and white for most scientists.   I suspect that there is a great deal more to the subject that the author communicates and I felt a bit cheated that there was not more substance in this book.  Did I miss something? If I did then the book did not work to convey the subject. If I didn't then fuzzy logic is one of a myriad of tools to handle uncertainty, and thus is a small branch of probability.   
 There's one reason and one reason alone that I was very interested to hear Midnattsol's debut album "Where Twilight Dwells", and it was because Liv Kristine's sister Carmen Elise Espanaes has the vocal duties for the band. Now I'm a huge fan of Liv's work with Theatre of Tragedy and later Leaves' Eyes, so I was curious to hear whether the talent was genetic or unique.  Unfortunately, things have not turned out the way I had hoped as this is mediocre folk influenced gothic metal that doesn't really interest me at all. As far as Carmen goes, there are occasions when she slightly resembles her awesome sister's vocal talent, but most of the time she falls way short. In fact, there are some highly cringe-worthy moments here, but it's not entirely Carmen's fault. Some of the lyrics are truly atrocious, and the music itself is pretty average as well, so she's on a hiding to nothing. I don't really have a problem with folk music's infiltration of metal, but when it's done poorly, it becomes quite embarrassing. They may be trying to achieve atmosphere over quality musicianship here, but there's nothing original or inspiring enough to make me pay attention.  Most critics seem to be receiving Midnattsol's release at the same time as label-mates Draconian's latest album "Arcane Rain Fell". It probably doesn't help Midnattsol's cause that Draconian's doom/death album is far superior to this and makes it look pretty bad in comparison.  There are a couple of tracks that stop me from completely panning it and make me believe that Midnattsol could possibly do something decent, but I'm pretty sure "Where Twilight Dwells" will struggle to find itself in my CD player in the future. If you still want to give it a shot after reading this, then I suggest you check out my local 2nd hand record store. You'll be in with a shot 
 Forbes is a great magazine.  Amazon on the other hand, well they ought to get out of the magazine business.  Order said first issue would be in February.  Amazon "forgot", to place the order until I called in April to find out what happened.  Now they claim the first issue will be June 19.  Yeah right.  Funny how they don't forget to charge the credit card you place the order.  Don't order magazines from Amazon 
 I loved this movie when it first came out, and I still love it, which is why I ordered the DVD. However, the scenes are coming off as dark (as in unlighted) and without needed contrast. There was also one point where the DVD skipped. For less than $6 the DVD was worth it, but if it had been any more I would return it 
 Bad, both as history and as analysis, even the neo-Marxist sort that it unabashedly mimics.  It's an embarrassment that the author has managed to turn this screed into an academic career as an expert on "public diplomacy."  That she has done so offers a lesson on ambitious self-promotion in the academic world.  She purports to tell the story about the former USIA, and ends telling no story at all.  She also misses the essential point about the former USIA: that its work was primarily in the field, people-to-people, and had little to do with politicized Washington policy-makers and attitudes of various administrations.  Her litany of pleas for a sense of the real America of working-class people misses completely the large majority of Americans who are religious and socially conservative, exactly the kind of Americans who resonate well with Africans and Latin Americans, to name two important parts of the world. This isn't surprising for someone who freely cites Marxist Howard Zinn and places his photo on her website.   Ultimately, however, this non-book is just sad.  USIA was a failure in many ways, but the story deserves to be told by a real historian, not a sham professor of "communications" who happened to do an internship in the now-dead USIA.  Now that Snow has set the standard for interns, I'm waiting for Monica Lewinsky's analysis of the presidency.               
 This book uses ONE single map on every page to document the movement of various people over time.  However, it does not  designate major landmarks.  It tells of tribes crossing the Danube and the Volga but these rivers are never labeled.  It refers to the Tigris and Euphrates but you need another map to tell you where they are.  When major landmarks are not identified it is hard to understand how this can be called an Atlas.  The history is disjointed and poorly written.  The only reason to buy this book is that you don't have a match with which to burn your money 
 by the yummy colors used to draw the cover or by the title or the gist written on the cover...this is definitely not for chick lit addicts, more like for kids who dont know what they want yet and are more forgiving with grave mistakes, namely, this book... it was more disappointing for me cos i've been in search for this book for a very long time and when i finally read it, it was such a letdown! i cant even begin to explain why...it's so misleading cos it's trying to sell itself as a sort of light read about 2 sisters and possibly their life trying to deal with rivalry and their apparent differences but nooooo...a little halfway through a crime was committed (huh!?!) and a stupid wild goosechase to solve the mystery ensues..oh please..stop me now..ok let me explain how bad it is...i dont have very high standards in books, i mean im up for anything as long as it makes sense or at least the author KNOWS what she wants to write about and this book cant even begin to deliver to that!...i signed up with amazon just so i can write a review to send the message to everyone that this book is BLAH. it is that bad 
 Mr Silber must indeed be very good at self-promotion: he obviously got all his friends and extended family to write great reviews about this mediocre book.  When I set out to pick a book on self-promotion, I wanted useful insights (something a little deeper than "smile, and the world smiles with you"), or at least a clear method -- a set of carefully selected and tested steps. After reading so many reviews praising this book, I thought I had finally found what I was looking for.  Big mistake. This book is not clear, or organized, or particularly insightful. It's just a big, long jumble of ideas loosely grouped into chapters that all seem to talk about everything and nothing. It is not very well written in terms of either formal grammar or style, and is only mildly amusing, as the lack of a clear direction quickly makes it boring.  But that's not all: the book is filled with quotes and pseudo-scientific "facts" that may be appropriate for a casual conversation among friends over a beer at a bar, but definitely not for a book that the reader would like to be able to rely on. In other words, it reads a lot more like The National Enquirer than The Washington Post.  In my opinion the author makes the mistake of confusing creative people with ignorant, unsophisticated people lacking a critical sense 
 This item arrived in perfect condition, and after following the directions on priming the Miracleware Popcorn Popper, I made my first batch of which half the kernels popped.  On my second try, the popcorn popper had holes burned on the bottom which made it unusable and I had to throw it away.  Sorry, this was a dud for me, and I have been making popcorn all my life 
  If you like Murder-Mysteries; you might like this. Attractive leads perform an average script.   Technically, good costumes, good lighting, attractive sets. The story holds your attention. The detective is interesting, and his sleuthing has some interest. If you like a light Whodunnit; you may like this. As good as anything on TV today. I rated this 2-stars, compared to "Road to Avonlea, Third season" mystery episode with Christopher Reeve, which I rate 4-stars. Not as clever as the TV show "Columbo"; but the period setting may make up for this.   This did not have what I was looking for, some adventure, more believability, more charm, and more cleverness.   The sets are attractively "staged"; rather than sets that take you there. Has pleasant characters; but not deep. Some good humor personality with the servants. The appeal is for one who likes a light, Whodunnit detective film, in a period setting; without my great expectations. I remember "Young Sherlock Holmes" as better; though I saw it a long time ago. 
  If you are deeply concerned with what various second or third rate actors and television personalities  of 5 to 10 years ago did during the WWII, this is the book for you. Otherwise, this is a throw away.    The most startling new information provided in this book are that Prescott Bush was a Senator from Maine and that Winston Churchill was prime minister of the United Kingdom during the 1939 German invasion of Poland.  Of course, Prescott Bush was a senator from Connecticut, and Churchill became prime minister in the Spring of 1940 after the Anglo-French invasion of Norway was defeated by the simultaneous German invasion.     France and England did not really come to the "rescue" of Norway from a German invasion. They had planned  their own invasion of Norway at the same time as the German invasion.  They were delayed by several hours due to weather and claimed to be helping Norway against Germany. Paradoxically, Chamberlain fell because of the fiasco in Norway, and Churchill who was the architect of this disaster became prime minister! Of course, this is the kind of fact you are never told about the war, that someone like Wright could never tell you.  I expected to find such things in this book.   Mike Wright's ignorance and  the absence of any apparent fact checking by the publisher indicate that both are worthless as sources of serious information.       With no special knowledge or interest in World War II, Wright compiles a bunch of humorous or trivia-related vignettes about the war as he appears to do about as many subjects as he can publish books.     However,I feel sorry for someone like the author who believes people need to know how Swooze Kurtz--whatever she does???--got her name. I feel sorrier for someone who is bamboozled into thinking this is a book with new information about the greatest tragedy in human history.  A war in which scores of millions of people died and many countries laid waste deserves more than drivel like that!      With the opening of the archives of the old USSR and the GDR, all sorts of information that was not known before is available for a serious author who really wants to tell us things that we weren't told about WWII. I expected this kind of information when I purchased this book. Yet, Wright is oblivious to the fact the major segment of WWII in Europe was fought between the USSR and Germany and its allies.    His goal is to provide quick, entertaining, light reading on a subject that is neither quick, entertaining, nor light.      The copy editing and fact checking in this book is simply not professional.  While a bibliography which is useful is provided, there is absolutely no regular sourcing in this book, which may, in fact, be a tribute to adequacy of his sources, compared to the inadequacy of his history.  As somone who teaches college students to discern which books to use for research papers and which to avoid, I would advise people to avoid any book brought out by this publisher for serious research or reliable knowledge.       This book does have its moments. He gives an interesting blow by blow picture of the draft process when it was launched in 1941.  He also provides interesting information about the deportation of Japanese Americans and Canadians, and about German prisoners of war in the US.    However, though he condemns Japanese brutality to Allied prisoners, Wright is completely silent the attrocities the US and UK  perpetrated against Japanese soldiers who wished to surrender.  Allied policy was usally not to take Japanese prisoners, but to massacre them.  A grisly trade in Japanese sculls and gold teeth  sent back to the USA grew up during the War. This is the kind of fact about World War II that "They Didn't Teach You" that is light years away from anything Mike Wright knows.     For a better look check out "Why the Allies Won." For an even better set of information about the Pacific war that is NEVER TOLD consult War Without Mercy by John W. Dower which will tell you about Allied abuse of Japanese prisoners as well as Japanese crimes against other Asian peoples.       I found this book OK to read while I was sick in bed. I did not want anything demanding, although I must say that one driving factor in getting me to finish it was to see how many ignorances and errors the book contained. Like the one Harliquin romance I read under similar circumstances, I thought it was appropriate to throw the book away when I finished it.  It is unfortunate Amazon does not permit one to have 0 stars or negative quantites of stars.     
 Like many other reviewers, I struggled with this book. For more than 600 pages, Anna Wulf explores every thought and emotion that comes into her head and tries to make sense out of her life. This might be an interesting book for fiction writers, who might understand the elaborate process Anna goes through to create characters and combine her life with her art. But for the average reader, this is just too much and too long.  I am very patient with novels. Perhaps too patient, because I should have put this one down sooner. I got all the way to page 500 before I realized I just couldn't go on. And it's quite depressing to invest so much time in a book and then put it down. Doris Lessing says herself that no one should force themselves to read a book they are not connecting with. I should have taken her advice sooner. But while some books you might not just be 'ready' for, I don't think I will ever be ready for this one.   It's disappointing because I am a Doris Lessing fan. The Four-Gated City explores many of the same themes - an emotional breakdown can be constructive in order to build yourself back up whole and understand the world around you. Anna Wulf did have a fragmented mind, as demonstrated through her keeping of four separate notebooks. She was kept together by the routines of her life, such as making breakfast for her daughter. When she didn't have anything constructive to do, she thought herself to death. And if you read this book, you'll likely be right there with her - going crazy. 
 This book is OK for learning what it covers. Also, considering Gussow's Schaum's Outline of Basic Electricity was last published in 1983, age might also have been a factor. However, the regular Schaum's on this subject just came out in December 2006, and it has been extensively updated and covers the material this book covers and much more, plus it is just as easy to follow as this book is. You get an extra 300 pages of material for an extra two dollars. If you need to learn the material in this Easy Outline, you are going to eventually need to know the material in Schaum's Outline of Basic Electricity, 2nd Edition, so you might as well just buy that one book 
    Since I do a lot of driving, I bought this as an audio book to hopefully ease the pain of sitting in traffic. This book is more irritating than traffic jams.          The heroine in the book, if you can call her that, was not at all likable. She was arrogant and in my opinion, her arrogance made her foolish. For example, when a police detective she was working with telephoned her on her cell and asked her where she was she responded with a smart remark rather than tell him where she was. Why? Simply because she did not personally like him.  Moments later she was knocked out and taken captive. Later when she woke up she bemoaned the fact that no one knew where she was. Dumb! And this is only one example of her stupidity. Ironically, earlier in the book she referred to this police detective and his partner as tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum. Later, this same policeman saved her life, but she still was unappreciative and belittled him even when it was pointed out to her that the man saved her life.       The "heroine" also had a Canadian boyfriend who pretended he was a cowboy throughout the entire book. I thought maybe the author had just seen "Pillow Talk" with Rock Hudson pretending to be Rex Stetson while she was writing this book. It was bad.       The "heroine" had been separated from her husband for years but failed to obtain a divorce. She seems to have a hard time taking care of unfinished business and she constantly complains about everything.      The author bores the reader with long, drawn out descriptions to the point the reader or listener is screaming, "Okay, I get it! It's hot outside!" If that weren't bad enough, readers or listeners of this book are subjected to lectures on how we evolved from apes and endangered turtles. If I wanted to read about endangered turtles I would go to the non-fiction section. To add insult to injury, the big mystery in the book, the disappearance of an entire family, turned out to be a complete non-mystery.       I was determined to listen to the whole thing but finally, on the last half of the tape, after enduring another political lecture, I could take it no more. I took the tape out and threw the entire thing in the trash.          I have read thousands of books and I've listened to probably more than 60 audio books.  This was the absolute worse of the lot.  If you want to read or listen to a good forensic mystery, stick with Patricia Cornwell and her Dr. Kay Scarpetta series. Cornwell's books are worth reading!  
 I like Moore, but don't doubt the "bias" of his films. Indeed, I have little doubt of some of his hypocrisy, i.e., some have suggested he's living pretty high on the hog, a contradiction to his rabid anti-corporate stance.  I've always been amused at the reaction to "Fahrenheit 9/11" because of the records it broke, but also because of the films produced as a reaction to it (as if produced by some spoiled brats with little talent but support of those with money. Hmmm....) Fahrenheit was, frankly, pretty well done. (Recall that such pseudo-documentaries were done just a few years ago by Falwell's cronies trying to make, say, Ollie North look like a patriot and saint, rather than like the felon he is!)  For cryin' out loud, Moore said he was making an anti-Bush film--not hard to do anyway. Get over it!  As others pointed out, this film is the reaction of a spoiled brat. I had a drink with a guy who became a friend a few months ago. When I brought up Moore in passing, that guy said, "Oh, he just hates America." So that's become the battle cry of those, you know, who still think Sadam was responsible for 9/11, those--like that friend--who insist that the lack of WMDs in Iraq is ultimately either untrue or inconsequential. (!) And that battle cry is as meaningless as any of their other platitudes.  Indeed, my nephew, a Republican activist, commented on the points in Fahrenheit that "took things completely out of context." But he could specify NONE which did so.   So fans of this rubbish are running on these platitudes, articles of faith rather than on anything factual. That too causes me to appreciate Michael more.  But using Dinesh D'Souza as a source of information and commentary? D'Souza's degree of ideology makes anything Moore does seem quite moderate really.  If you don't like Moore's films, okay, don't watch 'em. But do yourself a favor and don't pay any attention to this diatribe. 
 I can only imagine how painful it must of been to "act" in this film. After the first half hour it was like a train crash to watch. Do anything you can to get out of sitting through this 
 Dave Barry's novel is a quick read, but there's nothing fresh about the story or the characters.  The story centers on many different characters that become involved in a potential airport disaster--a columnist, his son, a rich, sleazy lawyer, a wannabe criminal, etc.  Like Elmore Leonard's books, the characters begin to collide in unpredictable ways.  But the pay-off is just not that great.  You may find yourself thinking "What's the point?" after finishing the novel.  This book was made into a pretty forgettable movie that featured a great cast (Tim Allen, Rene Russo, Stanley Tucci, Tom Sizemore, etc.) 
 I would like to rate this magazine with at least a good rating but that is not possible since I have never received my subscription. I have waited over 4 months since I first paid. I have called and was told I would get a call back telling me when I could expect to start getting it but never did get the call nor the magazine. That was 4 weeks ago. If you want to find out about this magazine go somewhere else. It is not here and no telling if it will ever be here 
 "The Future of War" predicts US dominance of warfare throughout the 21st Century, as a result of US advanced technology in general and precision weaponry in particular. Their train of thought has considerable merit, and deserves reading and thoughtful attention. However, the book suffers from the same two major flaws as most books by visionaries without enough practical experience: misunderstanding of specific happenings in the past, and unlikely projections into the far future. Having been involved with US defense for 50 years, as a member of the military, as a designer and developer and advisor on US weaponry, and as an advisor on strategic, operational and tactical issues, I read this book with considerable amusement, although I do take seriously much of what it says. I shall give specifics on two failures to understand the details of the past, and then offer criticism of two of the book's projections, as examples.  Past episode #1: The 1991 precision strikes against Iraq. There is no doubt that our air strikes and land attacks in the 1991 campaign to liberate Kuwait were exceedingly effective, and there is no doubt that this effectiveness was largely due to our precision weaponry. However, to do precision strikes, whether with airborne munitions or ground forces, it's necessary to know what targets to attack, where they are, and what weapons are likely to be effective against a particular target. In the 1991 campaign, this effort was undertaken by the "Jeddi Knights", largely under the guidance of Col. John Warden. The key role of the "Jeddi Knights" was to establish priorities and mission profiles for which targets to strike when with what munitions, and they did this extraordinarily well. What the Friedmans obviously don't know is the amount of detailed information that was available to the "Jeddi Knights", carefully acquired over the 70 years preceding the campaign, first by the British until about 1950, and thereafter by the US military. The armed forces of major powers assume they may have to fight wars on short notice aganst opponents who have been designated shortly before by national authorities, so they invest a great deal in gathering information pertinent to how various campaigns might be conducted. In the case of Iraq, the British did very careful mapping from 1920 until about 1950, producing "ordnance" maps of higher detail and accuracy than exist even for some parts of the United States, and these were invaluable to planners. Then, starting in about 1950, when it began to seem possible that the US might someday have to fight somewhere in the Middle East, the US military carefully gathered information relevant to how a campaign might be fought, and which potential enemy targets should be candidates for destruction. These studies resided in US intelligence and military archives until the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and were then used as the basis for planning the campaign.  Two examples of this. First, the destruction of certain bridges was given high priority not to impede vehicular movement, but to sever the communications cables running under the bridges; our planners knew which cables important to Iraqi Command and Control were buried too deeply to destroy easily except where they were routed under bridges, and therefore which bridges to take out to disrupt Iraqi military communications. Second, the swing by US, British and French forces far to the West, the "Hail Mary" gambit, would not have been possible in that harsh terrain unless viable routes for armor and supply vehicles were known, and the Iraqi Army either didn't know of such routes or didn't believe we could know of them. There are exactly two feasible routes, and both were used; they can both be determined in complete detail from careful study of the British Ordnance maps prepared in the 1930s, and (although I wasn't involved in the campaign planning) I had no difficulty in finding and plotting the only two feasible routes before the ground campaign began, from the good maps in my possession. I also understand why it was necessary to bring the two prototype JSTARS systems to the theatre, to detect and allow blocking of any Iraqi strike intended to sever the Tapline Road; this was also evident from the maps.  By contrast, we had no success at all in locating and destroying mobile Scud missile launchers, because they moved around with great frequency. If you don't know where something is, no precision of your weaponry, and no amount of technical sophistication or military skill, will allow you to destroy it.  Past example #2: The SAFEGUARD BMD system. The Friedmans say, on the basis of assertions by people who may or may not be experts, that SAFEGUARD was deactivated because it wouldn't work. In fact the situation was exactly the reverse, but one must know the purpose of SAFEGUARD and its mode of operation to understand what actually happened. The mission of SAFEGUARD was to prevent complete success of a Soviet counterforce first strike against our Minuteman ICBM fields, by opening a "launch window" for a retaliatory strike by the Minuteman missiles in the face of a full-scale Soviet strike. I helped to plan and design that system, and it would have done what it was intended to, although at a horrible increased toll of death and destruction, which I dreaded, but could see no alternative to in the face of rapidly increasing Soviet capability. Far more important than the fact that we knew SAFEGUARD would work was the fact that the Soviets concluded it would work; that realization brought them back to the bargainng table at the Helsinki talks, and led to the SALT I treaty, which I rejoiced about. Provisions of that treaty made SAFEGUARD unnecessary, and that's why the one completed SAFEGUARD site was deactivated and construction on the other sites was stopped.  Also on the subject of balistic missile defense, the Friedmans assert that midcourse discrimination and destruction of incoming warheads is infeasible. This is simply not true, although there is an exceedingly serious problem associated with doing it. I know three quite different ways of doing midcourse discrimintion and destruction of enemy incoming warheads, and, given that I've been out of that business for more than 10 years, I expect that other ways are known by now. The problem is that, at least for the three ways I know, one is politically unacceptable to the US Congress and the US public, one is so expensive that it's unlikely Congress would ever fund it, and the third, if fully developed, would be usable for certain other military purposes that would probably lead to a renewed arms race as our potential major opponents sought to counter it. (I was one of a small group of scientists who successfully recommended to Congress that development of that third approach be stopped, to avoid the resulting foreseeable escalation; scientists and military professionals, despite various comments in the Friedmans' book, work closely together over years and decades, and come to have considerable knowledge of each other's fields.) Whether at some future time it may become desirable to develop and deploy a BMD system that does midcourse discrimination and destruction of warheads is a political and diplomatic question to be decided by the public and its elected leaders, on which I have no insight, but it is technically feasible.  Now, turning to the future, what the Friedmans fail to understand in their glowing vision of US technology dominating future warfare, is that for every technical advance, opponents can devise at least partial countermeasures, and that therefore no amount of technology as such can determine the outcome of a campaign. The Coalition conquest of Iraq in 2003 provides an excellent example. Although large parts of the Iraqi army, and all of its top leadership, was utterly incompetent, other large parts of the Iraqi army were composed of thoroughly trained officers and enlisted men, who fully understood that if they confronted US forces nose to nose, they would be destroyed. Understanding this, very many of the best Iraqi units simply demobilized themsleves and disappeared into the civilian population as Coalition forces approached, in many cases taking their weaponry with them. One entire Iraqi division near the border with Iran totally vanished before we got to its bases; everyone from the division commander to the most junior private. Professional soldiers, even if motivated to fight, have no more desire than anyone else to be killed pointlessly in a situation where they are unable to resist effectively.  A substantial fraction of these well-trained, motivated Iraqi forces subsequently emerged as part of the resistance movement that continues in Iraq. How many of the resistance fighters come from that crowd is obviously impossible to know for sure, but my personal estimate is that about 30,000 of Saddam Hussein's best and most loyal troops and officers became part of the resistance movement. And our overwhelming superiority in all aspects of conventional warfare have been far less effective against current Iraqi resistance methods; the resistance movement seems to be gradually weakening and fragmenting, but it's a long slow process, in which our precision weapons and our advanced communications and intelligence give us far less of an advantage than they do in conventional warfare.  There are various other gaps in the Friedmans' assessment of the future. I'll mention only two of many. First, vircators, often touted as the most effective weapon of the 21st Century, have had only relatively diappointing results so far. Why? Partly because technical improvements to vircators are needed; those will surely come along in due course. Much more serious is the fact that battle damage asssessment after a vircator strike is at present almost impossible to do with any degree of accuracy, so after a target has been attacked with one or more vircators, there is no practical way to know whether the strike was successful or not. Presumably some day we will overcome this particular problem, but it illustrates that new and potentially formidable technology may find relatively little application because of purely tactical and operational problems that arise in using it.  As my second example, I'll remark on the Friedmans' vision of US infantrymen as being in effect "cocooned" in future to protect them from the enemy's weapons. This vision ignores two serious problems. First, no "cocoon" imaginable can protect an infantryman against certain weapons such as a fuel-air bomb if the enemy knows approximately where the infantryman is. Second, and closely related, anyone with substantial experience in concealing himself in a hostile environment, including me, knows all too well that the more accoutrements one has, the harder it is to hide and not be observed. In light clothing and carrying only light personal weapons, I can disappear into the landscape almost anywhere, and move around unnoticed; burdened with excess equipment and elaborate protective clothing, only certain carefully selected spots can offer concealment. Everyone with experience in this matter knows as much as I do on this subject, so infantrymen whose lives depend on not being observed will move far more cautiously when heavily burdened than when lightly armed and lightly protected. That doesn't mean infantry should be sent into combat inadequately equipped, but it does mean that the increased effectiveness of some given number of trained infantry when provided with extra combat capability and protective equipment is far less than one might otherwise suppose.  I could cite dozens of other matters, past and projected, which the Friedmans book misunderstands or overlook, but this is enough. I'll just say that the book is an excellent source of ideas, but should be viewed with practiced skepticism 
 John Morgan has lost himself in such skeptical toughts... In summary, he does not believe in sience, in knowledge, in knowning patterns, in medicine, in neurology, in anything... It adds very little, instead of bad mood. Don't waste your money 
 So, you find yourself almost 400 pages into a book you are writing and you run short of ideas. What do you do?  A.	add some horrible time travel paradoxical ending or  B.      have the main character hit by a semi as he crosses the street 
 Started out okay with the promise of interesting characters, but just got dull and wordy. Didn't finish it. Maybe more enjoyable for a South-American history buff 
 I wouldn't highly recomend this book for students who want a quick fact review before the exam. The book would however be good for students who might have trouble writing or organizing essays. The only part of the book I found really helpful was the outline at the back of the book which goes over such things as causes of various wars and famous people. I used that to review the nigh before the exam. But be forwarned if you do buy this bok to help you with the essay it will take you a while to read 
 I had a very frustrating experience two times I tried to buy this book...each time I recieved book that had no illustrations or plates or diagrams that were listed in the contents...I had books with 174 pages when the book is supposed to have 300 pages...I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS ABOUT BUT I FINALLY CALLED BORDERS AND THEY HAVE THE BOOK WITH 300 PAGES WHICH I bought WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF 
 I chose this book quickly before a business trip thinking from the title that it was going to be an engineering-style analysis of various bad ideas that held sway for a long time despite being clearly wrong.  Just reading the back of the book, though, makes it clear that this book is about modern policies that the author disagrees with.    It's so one-sided that it could only be enjoyed by someone looking for selected facts to support regressive political positions.  Counter arguments are almost never addressed.  The book takes a self-righteous tone that gets tiresome after a while.    Some of the points she makes seem out-and-out wrong:  1) She frequently refers to people she disagrees with as "elites".  Often these are the people who at least claim to be trying to do something to help the neediest members of society.  It seems to me that the "elites" would be the people who don't need any help whatsoever.  2) She describes a law student who was brought to tears when she was exposed to racism against her for the first time.  No one should have to deal with racism, but it strikes me as funny that one incident of racism in someone's life is worthy to write about in a book.  I've heard there are other aspects to law school that are more grueling than being exposed to racism one time. 3) Often times it seems like the author's arguments are meant to appeal to the reader's envy.  She is reminding people that wasteful projects to help the needy are costing people who aren't needy.  Isn't the more important issue that resources are being wasted that could have helped more needy people?  Not for the author.  I try to ask myself how I would react if the book were equally one-sided and superficial but put forward ideas that I personally agreed with.  After all, I have enjoyed reading through Michael Moore's books which are even less balanced and intellectual than this book.  Why do I like Moore's books more?  Maybe it's because he has fun with the ideas; I'm not sure.  I cannot recommend this book except to someone who already agrees with regressive politics and wants some easy reading.  
 Were it not for Eminem's diatribes of the hood and a handful of curious Detroiter's (former and current), I can't imagine what interest this book would hold for anyone.  I know the area Clemens speaks of and it is nothing short of amazing that he has so little to write about that is interesting.  I suspect that the author was an "academic-in-waiting" from his earliest years and that the sounds and heat of the street were a little too dangerous for his sensitive soul.  I will give him credit for being a decent writer, though.  Furthermore, claims by a number of reviewers that Mr. Clemens is racist are pure politically correct nonsense.  It is more likely the case that the author is guilty of being white and a bit naive 
 I never saw this movie until i was 16. The girl i was dating at the time loved this movie. The rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way. But they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies. I did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments, well so did fraggle rock! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason! everyone burn your copies now 
 ...but this was a mandatory book for my university's two-course Data Structures & Algorithms sequence that all computer scientists and computer engineers must take.  Coming in with a good deal of programming experience, I find that this book is not as clear or as complete as it could be.  The sample code snippets throughout tend to be awkwardly implmented with obscure variable names and obtuse datatyping, and more often than not represent 'a' way of accomplishing a task rather than 'the best' way.  Finding better ways of doing things is normally left for exercises at the end of the chapter; the answers are not included with the book.  Also, many significant details or comments are skimmed over or are ommitted from the text.  Many important (and complex) observations are left as exercises - but again, the answers are not included, so there is no way of validating your answers.  Further, this book is targeted at the C++ language.  It is obscene to discuss data structures and algorithms without mentioning the free, prepackaged, and optimized code of the C++ Standard Template Library.  Indeed, this book and the code it includes would have benefitted from the ingenious architecture and software engineering behind the STL.  I really hope the campus bookstore will buy this one back when I'm done with it 
 'mwiley' was right on the money.  This book was written by someone who was trained neither in the art of writing nor in the topic he was trying to teach to others.  It's full of meandering, unstructured discussion of what the author thinks the truth to be and presenting it as fact.  The only background material he sites as reference is the bible - no surveys, no clincal studies, no science.  And some of it is obviously wrong.  For instance, he claims the reason adult men like females breasts is because they enjoyed the nursing experience as infants.  Easy to disprove several ways: 1) Many males were bottle-fed, but still enjoy breasts just the same. 2) Female infants are often breast-fed but, but as adults, do not have the same level of interest. 3) Adult males seek out other parts of the female anatomy in the same manner, but these have nothing to do with nursing. 4) Adults, in general, do not remember what it was like to be breast-fed.  Subconscious memories you say?  If that were the case, then adult males who were bottle fed would seek out Playtex baby bottles instead of breasts because most of the pleasures MacDonald sites associated with breast-feeding are also present with bottle-feeding.  That said, occasionally there are snippets of his opinions (note I've intentionally refrained from using the word 'information') which are useful in answering questions I've had about how widespread my thought patterns, as a man, are.  But rather than forcing me to read through 200 pages, these could have been covered in about 10. 
 I was trying to remove the page holder thingy and was pulling rather hard on it, when it popped out it put a great big scratch along the top of the acrylic lens.  Great...  I love damaging a pricey doodad within the first five minutes of owning it.  Also, the bright/dim switch didn't work. There was only one lighting level.  I'm returning it for that reason.  So far, I'm not impressed 
 I should have listened to "this textbook isn't for the ordinary Web developer", not "this book is a must for all people interested in XML!"  The book is quite academic.  It presents a formalism for  describing semi-structured data and queries on those data, then illustrates  how XML, XML-QL, XSL, etc can be understood in terms of that formalism.  I  am not sure who would find this useful -- perhaps the people who are  working on new extensions to XML itself?  Or a person who is designing  parsers?  Probably not a person who is just trying to use XML 
 First off I would like to say the authors like Peter David are what has killed sci-fi literature.  This book, and the others in the series, only offers stale and emotionless sequence actions taken by the fairly flat characters in the book.  It would have been more enjoyable as a two-page outline of events. At least then I would not have felt cheated 
 I can't describe how disappointed I was in this book.  I read some of the other reviews and was so excited when I got it for Christmas.  But, my exitement quickly faded.  I thought the book was way too chatty, and I hated the guy-o-meter.  I'm sticking with Cooking Light for healthy cooking 
 This book, and its discription, lead you to believe that you will discover secrets about the series; that you'll learn about the allusions in the series; and basically that it is the ultimate commonplace book to go refer to.  It is wrong.  It is filled with useless facts that you could find on google if you looked for 5 minutes.  I grew bored with it in 15 minutes and put it down.  All it is filled with, is facts semi-related to the series (for instance, it talks about the creatures in montys reptile room, and other REAL reptiles).  This doesn't explain anything new or interesting about the series, and you feel like you're reading an encyclopedia.  The author tries way to hard to be funny, and comes off as an annoying toddler trying to get your attention with a stupid toy that you dont care about.  At least read a few pages before you buy/rent it.    BE WARNED 
 Although HDCD encoded is printed on the CD, my CD player indicates the CD is not HDCD encoded. Perhaps Rhino will be reissuing this to correct the error 
 I enjoyed the book but the author's errors occurred in areas that I'm very unforgiving of.  In one place he mistakes semi-automatic firearms for fully-automatic firearms.  Even if the author doesn't feel obligated to do much research for light fiction like this, the editor should have caught something so blatantly wrong.    I enjoyed some of the ridiculous characters that always show up in his books.  But, like Stephen King, I'm beginning to notice that he has certain characters that he uses again and again.  The hermit in the woods that knows everything.  State troopers are always perfect and dedicated but feds and city cops are dummies.  Throw in a scene that involves a complicated sexual position.  It just seems a bit lazy.  I know it's light fiction, but I like a bit more flesh to my beach reading.  I should mention that I didn't actually "read" this book, I listened to the unabridged audio version 
 Once "The Very Best of 10cc" was released in 1997, it was the collection to have.  That collection included 15 tracks that spanned 10cc's career, ending with the Godley and Creme hit "Cry."  So why would this CD be released, especially since the only thing it offers over the prior CD is "Channel Swimmer" and "Don't Hang Up?"  Buy the CD "How Dare You" and "The Very Best of 10cc" and you will have three times the music you have on this CD for only twice the price.  An unnecessary addition to the 10cc portfolio 
 I bought this specifically for information about using the new LiveCycle Designer application that comes with Acrobat Professional to create interactive PDF forms. All of the information in this book (Chapters 26-29) is wrong about that app--none of the dialog boxes match, or are even close, and the program doesn't work the way it's described. I'm guessing that Adobe changed it after the book was written. 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 This book has the same format as the other "What to Expect" books, but some of the information is out of date.  This is not a book to read if you are breastfeeding, or if you are practicing any version of attachment parenting.  The breastfeeding section quotes studies that have since been proven wrong, and will make you feel guilty for breastfeeding your child past their first birthday.  I returned this book, and am looking for a more up to date toddler reference 
 "The Mermaid's Chair" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, "The Secret Life of Bees".  A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina.  Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally.  Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped 
 My friend has a minor talking role in this, so I downloaded it to see my friend, and because I admire some of De Palma's past work. The film displayed plenty of talent in all areas except script. I lost interest by the halfway point, and watched through the end only because of my personal connection. Plot resolution was implausible, even if it's based on fact. Characters fell apart 
 This DVD is terrible and I regret purchasing it. The worst thing is that during the cardio workout, the instructor is not going to the beat of the music AT ALL. She is so off. I personally cannot stand when workouts are not synched with the music. And the video looks like it was put together on a shoestring budget. Do not buy this video if you expect a nice, high-quality workout DVD 
 I was SO excited about getting this in the mail to start reading, I had just read "This Wheels on Fire" by Levon Helm (which is AMAZING) and wanted to read more about that kind of music and read a critics take on it all and well...it was awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was pretentious and cliche...all of it. I cannot understand why this book is supposed to be so great. He makes all of these assumptions about what these musicians bodies of work are really about or are supposed to represent but even to someone who was not alive during the time period, it is obvious B.S.! Marcus tries to explain that The Band's whole body of work is some sort of metaphor...that is about a "worried man"...that their work is a story that they have made up to represent their fears and their vices. If you want to know what "the weight" is about, read Levon Helm's book which is honest, touching, inspiring AND informative 
 I have greatly enjoyed the Anita Blake series previous to this installment, even going back to re-read many of them several times.  However, I found "Danse Macabre" disappointing. While the imagery and characters are solid and well-developed, this individual book greatly lacks for a plotline. The characters spend so much time having sex that they don't really get out of bed until somewhere after the first 400 pages, then they go to the ballet, which is interrupted by an emergency sex scene, then they finish watching the ballet, talk to someone at a dance club, then it's back into bed for more sex for the remainder of the book. This felt like a half-developed idea for a short story, propped up with 500 pages of extraneous sex.  Still, the endless sex scenes are very well written. If you enjoy detailed, passionate, sensual, group sex, erotica narrative, you will enjoy this book very much. However, if you are hoping for the exciting mystery and adventure of the previous thirteen Anita Blake novels, you will find none of that here.  On the bright side, the excerpt of the next book, while containing one sex scene, also contains a scene in which Anita interviews a client in her office. That does seem to suggest that an actual mystery may be addressed in book 15. Here's hoping 
 Surprised that I've been waiting so long for merchandise ordered some time ago 
 Instead of buying this book you can do the following:   1. Open up Adobe Acrobat on your computer  2. Choose Help from the menu_bar at the top of the screen  3. Select 'Complete Acrobat 7.0 Help...'  4. Look up what you need to know---as this book is no more useful than the Adobe Help Screen   Now wasn't that much easier, more informative, and a lot cheaper? Notice that, unlike most 5 star reviewers, I do not work for a publisher.  If you actually want to learn something instead of wasting your time and money with this garbage, look into "Sams Teach Yourself Adobe Acrobat 5 in 24 hours" by Christopher Smith & Sally Cox (ISBN: 0672323141).  I don't know if these authors (as a team) have any updated versions available but you'll learn more from reading Smith/Cox's version 5 book than Sahlin's version 7 book.  Also try "Adobe Acrobat 7 PDF Bible" by Ted Pandora.  Before you take the three five-star-reviewers seriously notice that they are solely five-star-reviewers. Naturally I am very skeptical of their 5-star review of this or any other book. Select their "See all my reviews" buttons to see what I mean. 
 Mr Silber must indeed be very good at self-promotion: he obviously got all his friends and extended family to write great reviews about this mediocre book.  When I set out to pick a book on self-promotion, I wanted useful insights (something a little deeper than "smile, and the world smiles with you"), or at least a clear method -- a set of carefully selected and tested steps. After reading so many reviews praising this book, I thought I had finally found what I was looking for.  Big mistake. This book is not clear, or organized, or particularly insightful. It's just a big, long jumble of ideas loosely grouped into chapters that all seem to talk about everything and nothing. It is not very well written in terms of either formal grammar or style, and is only mildly amusing, as the lack of a clear direction quickly makes it boring.  But that's not all: the book is filled with quotes and pseudo-scientific "facts" that may be appropriate for a casual conversation among friends over a beer at a bar, but definitely not for a book that the reader would like to be able to rely on. In other words, it reads a lot more like The National Enquirer than The Washington Post.  In my opinion the author makes the mistake of confusing creative people with ignorant, unsophisticated people lacking a critical sense 
 "Wild at Heart" is flawed at heart. It is about the heart of man - not the heart of God.   "Have you got what it takes?" is the recurrent humanistic theme.  The author's psychological analysis of the male psyche is interesting, but its message of "validation" puts man firmly on the throne, and there is no room for that if God is to be King in His kingdom.  It espouses no Christian distinctives whatsoever even though it frequently and selectively misquotes scripture 
 I have rarely been as glad to finish any book as I was this one. It is a vitriolic diatribe that is long on allegation and short on substance.   The author is wellknown as an extreme leftist and this book is just more of the same. He hates George W. Bush, Republicans, business people, and Americans in general. This is really nothing more than a poorly done smear job on all kinds of people that Mr. Moore despises.   It is extremely poorly documented. Moore uses some footnotes in chapter one, but does not use any throughout the rest of the book. Even the footnotes he does use are based upon dubious sources. Included among those are several books written by Bush haters. He even cites Al Jazeera as a source. I was quite surprised that I didn't see the National Enquirer listed among his 'reliable' sources.   Some of Moore's rants are so contradictory that they are really quite pathetic. In one section he claims that Osama Bin Laden was unlikely to have planned or directed the 9/11 attacks. He said that Bin Laden is on dialysis in a cave in Afghanistan (That must be some cave. The bat cave perhaps?) Just a few pages later, Moore is incensed that some of Bin Laden's relatives were allowed to leave the United States after the 9/11 attacks without being questioned by the FBI. I am wondering why they would need to be questioned since Moore is so convinced that Bin Laden didn't direct the attacks. He thinks that the Saudi Arabian government did it. In yet another part of the book, Moore gives us his 'plan' for getting things back on track. His first item listed is 'Catch Osama Bin Laden.' Why? Moore doesn't think Bin Laden did 9/11. Why worry about him?   Another absurdity in Moore's rantings is his claim that the media is biased in favor of the Iraq war. I don't know where he is getting his news but it sure isn't ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, The Washington Post, The New York Times, or any of the other establishment press.   Moore also thinks that most terrorists are 'homegrown' in the United States. Evidently he hasn't followed current events the last 30 years. Excluding Timothy McVeigh, Moore would be hard pressed to list any other 'homegrown' terrorists.   In yet another spot, he carries on for a long time saying that there is no terrorist threat. He claims any concerns about terrorists are just manufactured by the Bush Administration as an excuse to violate the rights of everyone in the world, keep himself in power, etc.   Another very bizarre position that Moore takes in this book is his advocacy of his ideal presidential candidate - Oprah Winfrey. While I'm sure she is a very nice person, she seems like an odd choice for a presidential candidate. She is a talk show host. Should she not be the selection, he thinks Tom Hanks would be a great choice. Again, I'm sure he is a very nice person, but that is not how we pick presidents. This one position alone shows that Moore is not a serious commentator or worthy of having his views considered by reasonable people.  I could go on and on about the inaccuracies in this book. Suffice it to say, it is merely the rantings of an extreme partisan who has little regard for the truth. 
 Tom Hodgkinson's book "How to Be Idle" is no misnomer. It really is an instruction manual on how to be lazy. But after the first few chapters, I got so tired, I didn't want to finish it. I guess I was feeling too lazy to feel that reading this book was worthy of my time. I wonder how long it took Mr. Hodgkinson to write this book. Despite his sophism, it appears he put much effort into it. I'm sure he thought it out, drew up an outline, then wrote several drafts--maybe even staying up late some nights?--before hawking it to publishers in the hopes of having a best seller. If Mr. Hodgkinson took his own advice, he wouldn't have ever finished it. If only! But there lies the hypocrisy of Mr. Hodgkinson's theory. Laziness, mediocrity and incompetence are good enough to sell to the rest of us, but not to the man doing the preaching. Perhaps Mr. Hodgkinson wants to alleviate his competition by convincing the rest of us to stay home and do nothing while he garners all the goodies for himself, unimpeded by that dastardly concept called "competition."  But imagine a world in which Mr. Hodgkinson's vision comes true, a world in which idleness is placed above hard work. Who would build our roadways? Who would construct our homes? Who would guard our borders? Imagine if scientists working on AIDS research decided to work only 30 hours a week, or took a three month vacation right in the middle of some breakthrough research. They shrug and say, "Ah, who cares, I need a break. Let them all die."  But even if we did take Mr. Hodgkinson's advise, how would we idle away our time? There would be no yachts to relax on: someone has to build it (but he's on a break, too), then you have to actually have the money to buy it, but since you're on a perpetual break you no longer have the money for that. There goes, too, your dream vacation to Hawaii. No cruises to the Caribbean. No lounging on the beaches of southern Europe. No one to fly you to Paris and London. No Champaign parties at Nobo's. No fine dining experiences at Chez Merde. In all our free time, we'll have nothing to do but rot away in our government-subsidized shacks waiting for death. Sounds fun!  A study conducted in 2004 at Emory University found that when people earned an award for having accomplished a game without help, subjects actually produced a chemical that made them feel happy. These endorphins were directly linked to productivity. On the other hand, subjects who were given awards for no reason not only failed to produce endorphins, but they actually began to produce a chemical that brought about depression. Mr. Hodgkinson failed to mention this study in his great treatise. He also failed to mention the other umpteenth disastrous causes and effects if his adolescent ideas were put to practice.  Idleness, as the Emory study showed, is unnatural. It's so unnatural, that in Mr. Hodgkinson's world, the human race wouldn't last a century, and our individual life spans would plummet back to 16th century levels. Even Mr. Hodgkinson realizes the absurdity of his own premise. He's not stupid. You see, Mr. Hodgkinson, another one of those egomaniacal socialists, really isn't arguing for a more laid-back lifestyle (how much more laid back can we get? We already work less than our great grand parents--in the "good old days" it took six hours just to make breakfast!). When it's all said and done, Mr. Hodgkinson isn't rationalizing the glories of idleness as much as slavery.  I stay home and do nothing, and you do all the work. How else can Mr. Hodgkinson's theories work? It's what socialism is all about. Enslavement. While others are snoozing away a lazy afternoon on the sofas, someone else is in the lab, the factory, the office or the operating room trying to improve our lives. But their endorphins won't be soaring because their wages would be confiscated and given to Mr. Hodgkinson. How else can he afford to be so idle?? Mr. Hodgkinson and his ilk call it "spreading the wealth," or, more accurately, stealing other's money.  Imagine if no one cared about their work, their careers. Imagine being told: "Sorry, but I can't operate on your son's brain tumor today, I'm going fishing." For those who gave this book rave reviews, you cannot complain if such scenarios ever come to fruition. Next time you have to call the 911 operator because your wife is having a heart attack and the operator exclaims, "I'm on my break!" you should have equal praise for her apathy. As your spouse lies dying and withering in pain, smile upon her and say, "But honey, sweetness, sugar buns, idleness is a virtue." Good luck trying to find a funeral parlor that's open when it's time to bury your wife's corpse. The funeral director read Mr. Hodgkinson's book, too. So pick up your wife's corpse, throw it into a plastic bag (if you can find one--no one is making them any more) and bury her in the back yard (if you still have one). But if you find this too much work, chuck her onto the side of the road for the non-existent trash collectors to pick her up. There is always hope, no matter how thin, that someone else will take care of things for you. Ah, idleness 
 In 1872 Charles Darwin's "The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals" addressed how emotions were an evolutionary adaptative process of the human species. In that book and in other similar books since (e.g., Johnston's "Why We Feel: The Science of Human Emotions," 1999), evolutionary biologists have shown that the adaptative function of emotions is to get us moving very quickly without having to rationalize or think about imminent perils as we had to do in our earlier hunter-gather society. In 1995, Daniel Goleman in his pioneering book "Emotional Intelligence" brought many of these evolutionary and scientific ideas to the attention of modern readers, advocating much greater attention be paid to developing healthy emotions in all of us, beginning in grade school and in the home. Now, Goleman returns in a book that highlights a symposia consisting of philosophers, psychologists, doctors, and the Dali Lama to see what insights Eastern thought in general, and Tibetan Buddhism in particular, might glean for us. The effort, while noble, has very little to recommend it.  Most of the book tangentially describes the goings on of the symposium itself; hardly electrifying knowledge! The rest of the book tries to correlate (where possible) Eastern Buddhist thought about emotions with the modern Western scientific paradigm. Often, this is no more than using Tibetan language for English terms. The neo-Darwinian prototype is occasionally raised, but never fully addressed. Then, in a systematic fashion, the emotions, affects, afflictions, emotional balance, etc., are described in a metaphysical context of how the Dali Lama and other lamas regard Western insights. Some spiritualists, transcendentalists, Eastern philosophers, and religionists may find the Dali Lama's comments insightful, but I found them bordering on the naive and over simplistic. Don't we already know (in the West, at least) that some emotions are healthy while others are simply inappropriate? It doesn't require new semantics in old wineskins to show us what we already know.   There's no question that some of the emotions we've developed over epochs of evolution no longer serve our modern-day purposes (although this isn't even explored). Further, there's no question that some people have either excessive or deficient emotions that could benefit from a reappraisal and some reeducation. For example, while anger in some people may precipitate compassion for the injured or harmed (a good effect), others blow off steam with weapons, familial abuse, and inappropriate agitation (bad effect). So, what's new about this insight? Nothing. Goleman does devote a chapter to writing about "schooling" the good effects from bad, but I found the reeducation slender and lanky (e.g., "our secular goal should be to support a healthy emotional immune system"). The analogy and metaphor are quaint, but not very descriptive or prescriptive of the reeducation program.  Emotions, according to most scientists as opposed to the doctrinaire religionists, are generally regarded as a normal and healthy part of our intrinsic human nature (see Johnston, supra., Pinker, "How the Mind Works," Wright, "The Moral Animal," Ridley, "Origins of Virtue," Sober & Wilson, "Unto Others," et alia). For those who suffer from inappropriate emotions, and obviously many people do, there are excellent self-help books (e.g., Cohen, "What Would Aristotle Do?" Ellis, "A Guide to Rational Living," Nussbaum, "Therapy of Desire," Burns, "Feeling Good," et alia). Reading the signposts from Eastern philosophy does little to inform us either about our emotions or how to control the inappropriate ones. Giving Western concepts Tibetan names does little to nothing to edify. Unlike Goleman's earlier book, this book not recommended 
 We all know what we need to do.  Some of us know it better than others, but we all have a certain amount of self-knowledge and a certain understanding of our place in the world.  Caroline Myss seems to think a more perfect understanding of yourself would help you be a better person and to better fulfill your purpose in life. But if it was that easy, wouldn't you already be doing what you know you should be doing?  What Caroline Myss writes will not help fulfill your "sacred contract". Self-knowledge is not the same as power, in the same way as a driver's manual is no help if you don't have gasoline in your car. 
 This book has an interesting take on how the mind interprets the slightest events between two people such as body language, facial expression and more. The facts laid out are informative. The prose though has much to be desired. Thu author uses "tacit" far too frequently, and clutters his points with obscure and infrequently used words. Commas and em-dashes are not in expected places, leaving you to read many sentences over again to get the meaning. I felt I had to stall way too often and not glide smoothly along. Good scientific work, but bad read 
 O'reilly has a grudge against CBS and Dan Rather. After, GI -Joeing it, standing eye-to-eye with the "bad guys" in El Salvador and Argentina, he gets no airplay. Then  with moral righteousness, he goes to a gay vacation place in Provincetown, convinced a "showdown"  was in the making between gays and het families. He gets no airplay. Too bad. Good for CBS.  O'Reilly's "morality" is psycho anachronistic. (e.g. Hollywood directors & celebrities, unless you look like Halle Berry.)Does a Johnny Depp movie really have to have a *moral* message?  He glosses over social and racial issues, and suggests that Al Sharpton, Susan Sarandon and Puff Daddy are misguided &/or dangerous,dishonest rabble rousers. Aside from the Tawana Brawley debacle, I'd have to disagree. The tone is turgid. The writing, junior high. The book is arranged so that O'Reilly always gets the last word after each interview--which is kind of sad-- especially when he interviews his intellectual superiors, like Mario Cuomo. Bill can't play a game without fixing the odds in his favor.  He fantasizes about Hilary Clinton & that's even sadder: "Each night while lying in bed I visualize the interview. At last we are together in the Zone. Her pansuit is peach, her hair is perfect. . ." He tells the reader he has this dream over & over . . .(Quick someone notify the secret service!)  He dares to invoke Jefferson in one sentence, and then decry "secularists" in another. He reacts violently when he thinks someone is not telling the truth, but he doesn't even give credit to his cowriters, or even acknowledge what's shady an dishonest about himself. 
 Just a rehash of the current fad thinking on compensation. Got to question the credentials of the author---PhD in sociology,  background in social work, never worked in the field, yet is on the b-school staff? With this social work background, one can see the roots for the bizarre "stretch" idea here---assign every employee a compensation case worker??? With its  outrageous tuition , the b-school students deserve someone with an apprpriate background. I liked the large font and graphics 
 Two stars may not be a fair rating of this book. I myself couldn't get beyond the first few pages. The author's first concern seemed to be to flaunt his showy "poetic" prose style in sentence after sentence like this one: "I waited for the purple bus to travel through these places edging the round cratered lake where something large from the sky struck long ago, places where the blacktop road sinks through soft-bottomed bogs and erupts flat and dry farther on, a serpentine plumbing of the earth's thin surface, the purple bus leaning on the quicksand curves, slipped tires spinning, the exhaust pipes gurgling, the white-eyed driver mostly blind and dreaming them along the road he drove, steering the bus to where I always slept in wait." Phew. Purple indeed. If this is the kind of writing that turns you on, you'll find plenty of it here 
 Deep Deceptions Was Not what it was advertised to be. In the advertisement it was to explain about how The Divinci Code just scratched the surface. The dvd talks about heaven and hell and nothing new or different about religion 
 Some nice pictures and does provide the Zen philosophy, but cannot be used to provide ideas nor gives a "how-to" to implement the Zen design into your home environment 
 I bought Power Reading by mistake at the bookstore - meant to get Peter Kump's Break-through Rapid Reading instead - and only had time to return it 5 days later. During the 5 days, I read Chapter 1 and browsed through the rest of the book.  Power Reading is to be done over 4 weeks. There are 4 chapters in the book - one for each week. It covers the same speed reading fundamentals every other speed reading book covers: regulation with a finger, having a purpose, how to approach different materials, high-speed techniques.  What I didn't like about Power Reading is that there wasn't much of anything in there. It talks about things like concentration and comprehension, reading purpose, note taking etc, but only skims the surface. I wanted to know why I should be doing the things it recommends and how they would help, but the explanations in there weren't sufficient to satisfy my curiosity and give me a reason to keep the book.  I returned Power Reading 5 days later, exchanging it for Peter Kump's book. Absolutely no regrets. Comprehension and recall/retention of material are very important to me. Having these while reading at tremendous speeds is a true sign of speed reader. Power Reading barely covered these topics, but Break-through Rapid Reading talks a lot about them and gives you drills to improve both.  If you are a beginner, get Peter Kump's book instead. If you are at an intermediate or advanced level, get Peter Kump's book instead. As there isn't any new information in Power Reading and you can finish reading it in a day, you can save yourself some money by borrowing it from the library instead 
 I am a education major at Macon State college.  John Dewey's book is simply a summary of three talks Dewey gave to parnets and students at the University of Chicago Laboratory school in 1896.  The book covers topics that are often very diverse and shares conflicting political and  philosophic positions in education. I found this book hard to read and very  wordy.  I did not enjoy the read at all 
 I bought this for my XBox 360 and it doesn't work at all, which is a good thing considering the other reviews I've read here. At least, by not working, it isn't damaging my Xbox 360 
 This is actually a revision of an earlier book of hers called "Invocation of the Gods". Unfortunately, this was not indicated anywhere that I saw on the Amazon site, so I ended up buying a book that I already own. I was hoping for a more, well rounded,book on Egyptian Pagan rituals this time. Sadly, this was not the case with this book. It's hardly surprising though, as Llewellyn Publications, the book's publisher, has a history of reissuing their "under-performing" books under new titles. It's gotten to the point that if I pick up a book in a store, and I see their logo, I just put it right back. Considering how few books there are out there on Egyptian Paganism, I'd like to recommend this one, but, I can't 
 A picture showing James Dean and Elia Kazan visiting the East of Eden set claims they're doing so in 1955 when they were probably actually visiting it in 1954 (the year they actually made EOE). I never thought of Kazan as being one of the greatest directors ever and I still don't. He's certainly no Alfred Hitchcock or Cecil B. deMille or Steven Spielberg. 
 I honestly can't believe that Robert Patrick wasted his time on this piece of [junk] movie.  Ugh!  One of the worst movies I've seen in quite a while 
 Forget this Cliff Notes crap! Just read Night. It's a great book and it won't even take you long to read. I wish I could give this Cliff Note book zero stars 
 Never received the book, so very disappointed at the delivery process and cost I have incurred 
 I could not wait to see this movie when I first saw the coming attractions.  I can honestly say that I wasn't totally disappointed but my life isn't any better now that I have seen it.  Only a few laughs here and not many memorable scenes.  Get it if you must but I would not waste too much money for it 
 First I quit buying books with Ludlum's name on them, then I quite reading them . . . that was years ago and this mess brings it all back.  I received the Bancroft Strategy as a birthday present from my daughter who takes gift-giving very personally, so I had to keep it.  The only reason I give it 2 Stars is because I'm still reading it, waiting for two DeMille books I ordered to arrive.  The stuff in this book is just plain D U M B.  Definitely don't waste your money, and don't waste your time, unless you have a good reason to do so, like someone else's feelings 
 this book sucked. all the other people in my book group and I hated this book. there is only a stupid plot about a pig running awa 
 This text was required for a course in Mass Media and Culture.  I have read many books on this very topic and find that Twitchell has some good things to offer to the discussion.  However, it is horribly written. The  writing is reminiscent of a college sophmore's english term paper.  The  chapters are long and grossly unorganized.  He repeats his points, is  unjudicious in the selection of his quotes, and includes superflous  examples from the media with little to no connection.  In short, this is an  ideal example of how NOT to write 
 An 18th century author writing about the dark ages. It reads more like incidents within a narrative rather than a single story.  I found the ending abrupt and not credible. I expected more of the creator of Sherlock Holmes 
 I have to agree with the few reviewers who found this book too gossipy and unfocused.  I have nothing against a chatty writing style, but this book takes it too far.  After reading the first chapter, I found myself wondering what the heck it had to do with the subject of Grace Dalrymple.  The author meanders away on side tangents to such an extent that there's really very little of Grace present in the book (and too much talk of other famous women like Cleopatra and Princess Di).  I understand the limited research material on Grace, but that's a rather poor excuse.  Great biographies have been written on less than well documented subjects before, but this is not one of them.  
 Jackson's ego is so overinflated that true knowledge of beer is obscured by his presence.  This book is boring, silly, and a waste of money.  It is also, like its author, shockingly overrated 
 Free things?  Not really. Recipes, information and how to get information is about all you get. The best FREE THING was my  ten bucks for nothing 
 3/4ths of the book is a re-telling of the Ilium followed up by a lukewarm, ending that isn't an ending at all. For shame Dan Simmons! You can do so much better, Olympos is a waste of your fans time and money while you obviously didn't spend enough time on it. 
 that is, trite, predictable and mawkish.  The film "Billy Elliot" was a genuine delight in every way, possibly a masterpiece.  All I know is that it delighted me from start to finish. If a musical could be made from this situation and these characters (and why should it since the film is all about reticent characters' passions finding expression through non-verbal means of boxing,dance, etc)these songs demonstrate why it should not be done. You know in advance where every song will go: one for the instructor, one for the grandmother, one for Billy's cross-dressing friend. And there has to be a stale anthem for the miners, a song from Mum beyond the grave, a song to lamely describe how Billy feels when he's dancing...even a thudding number to Maggie Thatcher that celebrates Xmas as "one day closer to her death." Elton John's music is no worse than it ever is and features a flagrant steal from Les Miserables.  This score could have been spit out of a computer program.  It aims low and succeeds.  No wonder it's a hit! Better to have recycled Johnny Cash songs on Broadway than junk like this...we already have enough junk of our own (Spamalot, anyone?).   
 The coffee is extremely hot from this coffeemaker. Beware! I find the product adequate but not outstanding. It is difficult to insert the pot all the way in after use 
 I AM A BIG FAN OF THIS SERIES AND HAVE READ THE BOOKS TWICE...ALL BUT THIS ONE. I WISH I HAD NOT EVEN READ IT ONCE AS THE SO CALLED "TWISTS" IN IT DEALING WITH BILL AND ERIC DO NOT FIT IN WITH THE REST OF THE SERIES AND LEFT ME FEELING TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED WITH MS. HARRIS'S PLOT. IT WAS JUST PLAIN NOT FUN 
 I got nothing but mad love and respect for the outlaws but they have def lost a step since pac's death. I think tupac must have wrote there rhymes cause they def do not have any skills. The cd also lacks production! The beats are terrible. The outlawz worldwide cd was also a huge waste! 
 These bottle leak, they're expensive... and you can't mix formula in them unless you buy the special tops or it sprays formula all over!  Don't waist you're money - they're a pain to wash, too many pieces, and they just plain leak.  After 9 months of using them I'm ready to toss all 30 of my bottles and start over with something else.  Plus, even with the top on, if they fall over in your diaper bag the whole bottle will leak all over everything 
 The book claims you can build all projects with standard components. However, every project contains at least one component that can only be ordered on the website of the author! No details about those components is provided to force you to buy it in his shop and make it almost impossible to find it somewhere else. Also, the claim that all projects can be built for less than 100$ is an outright lie! Most projects are very expensive. I can be very brief about this book. Don't buy it! It's just an advertisement folder for his own company disguised as a book. Besides, every project in it can be found in one form or another on the internet for free 
 okay, story straight...cash money makes songs about 1)hoz 2) bling bling 3)their pimped out ridez.  the beats are the same as last year's album.  they shoulda called this kit "recycled" yeah yea 
 I have read the Book of Mormon more than 12 times in English and once in Chinese. If you plan to use the Mormon missionary methodology (read, ponder, pray) to find out the "truth" of the book, at least read Mr. Grant Palmer's book Mormon Origins first so you will understand the origins of the book about which you are reading and praying. Personally, I won't be reading this version of the Book of Mormon or any other version again. There are too many other fictional books that are more worth my time. Don't drink the Koolaid (unless you know how it was made). 
 If you are looking for some decent *narration* on WWII special operations, this is a fair *audio* track. But for a DVD this is a very poor and tired rendition of primarily foreign special operations during WWII overlaid on old conventional force war footage. At one point the narration was covering saboteurs in France while showing footage of the USS Arizona burning at Pearl Harbor! The narration seems factually adequate, covering a number of WWII foreign special operations, but the video includes virtually no footage of foreign or US Special Forces (USSF). The little footage present is primarily still photos that are displayed for a few seconds with narration that is rarely about the particular photo. Much of the commentary on USSF was based upon the Vietnam experience and the problems suffered by USSF because of the lack of understanding of unconventional forces by conventional commanders. In fact, it seems that the very small portion on USSF was added early in the DVD simply to allow the makers of the DVD to claim the disk included a history of the Green Berets. Following that pathetic check-in-the-block, the narration turned to WWII effectively disrupting any sense of chronology. Much better buy: the National Geographic "Inside Special Forces". That DVD is up to date and "the real deal". I am a retired US Army Special Forces officer 
 Deuble's book aims to look past the post-biblical traditions that shape modern theology, to see the biblical Jesus afresh.  He asserts that this Jesus is in fact not divine.  It is commendable to courageously do away with tradtions that are comfortable, yet errant.  Deuble takes the right approach by studying the relevant Bible passages, while also taking note of historical and logical concerns.  However, I find his history, logic, and exegesis to be unsound, resulting in conclusions that are unconvincing.  In terms of history, he implies that he is reporting a scholarly "consensus" (see back cover), but in fact relies heavily on a few authors who do not reflect mainstream historical scholarship.  The most important and scholarly recent book about earliest Christian devotion to Jesus is Larry Hurtado's "Lord Jesus Christ."  Hurtado reaches emphatically different conclusions to Deuble, and backs them up very carefully, arguing that Jesus was treated as divine by the very earliest Christians, despite great odds against this happening.  In terms of logic, Deuble spends some time urging that Jesus was fully human - genuinely growing and earning his Lordship.  But this does not vary at all from the historical doctrine of the trinity, which views Jesus as utterly human, as well as utterly divine.  Another logical problem is the view that the trinity is too incomprehensible to be genuinely of God.  I don't think this must be the case - Just because something has no familiar analogy and thus is hard to systematise in credal form does not mean that the biblical data is itself unclear.  In terms of exegesis, Deuble's arguments centre around the idea that we must view the New Testament through "Hebrew eyes."  There is some important truth to this: We do need to recognise the influence of the Old Testament and Judaism.  But it is naive to practically deny any influence of Hellenism.  This naivete reaches absurdity when Deuble even argues that the Greek of John 1 should be understood in a "Hebrew" rather than a "Greek" way.  Likewise, Deuble's linguistic comments (such as on the aorist tense or genitive case) are simplistic and uncompelling.  This is a useful book to read if you want to be challenged, and its aims are noble... but it is methodologically weak, and therefore its conclusions are not altogether convincing 
 I am sure this will be a great magazine, but I have not received my first issue yet 
 I got this DVD for $1.99 and I still feel ripped off.  The quality of the movie was terrible, the story line was stupid, and the acting was just fair.  Do not waste your time on this poor movie.  Even though there are some stars in it in their younger days (Eloitt Gould, Michelle Piefer, David Caruso), it does not make up for the poor content of the movie.  Cheaply made---DON'T BOTHER!! 
 Flynn is half-crazy and I can't for the life of me understand how he was able to type with his arms in a strait-jacket. With a book this awful to his credit, he'd make a great White House reporter 
 Because Hinton's is the first Joni Mitchell biography I've digested, I was hoping for something that didn't leave a cheap, plastic taste in my mouth.  The known parts of her life that are inspiring to me were reduced to banal fodder mentioned in passing, while darker aspects became reasons for the author to step up to her vehement defense--these outbursts were nauseating and usually at the expense of someone else, leaving many questions largely unresolved.  Hinton tends to shuffle back and forth between regurgitation of objective fact and jarring personal opinion.  Incidentally, I like what one reviewer said about this book reading "like a last-minute book report".  The fact that he completely destroys my favorite JM album in his woefully amaturish musical critiques doesn't help either.  This book does not do justice to an artist such as Mitchell 
 This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there 
 Being a huge fan of the original, this was a waste of production money.  If one was to remake The Music Man, one would think the remake would be so totally different than the original there would be no room to compare.  Robin Williams would have been great in that respect! Matthew Broderick was a cardboard cutout with limited emotion and no dancing ability.  Why he keeps getting roles like this is beyond me 
 the subject is not an exaggeration, unless you are a mother this book is the biggest drag i've ever come across.  Franky this, Franky that, it's so repetitive, predictable and juvenile.  soooooo tacky, such a week and dwindling plot words cannot describe, this is the "gili" of the literary world.  I hope to sway at least one person from buying this book, just so my purchase will be justified 
 Out of date. Out of date. Out of date. This book was published in 1987 with no updates. Whey, as the primary protein supplement didnt even exist at the time. Half the book is recipes. If thats what your looking for then by all means purchase it. If your looking for a diet strategy based current knowledge then look elsewhere 
 I bought this DVD (as I have many others) based on the fact that it is supposed to be "customizable."  First, the DVD did not specify the amount of time each section was allowed.  Second, the feature that allowed the user to customize did not work with my DVD. I had to do "arms" first, and then the rest of the workout in the order presented.  I was not allowed to switch the workout around.  Third, I could only pick 3 of the 6 workouts in my "customized" session.  Not happy at all with that as I would have liked to add more.  This DVD was not user friendly and the information needed to time the workout is not there for the user 
 I give credit to people like Kanye, Fred Durst, and Britney Spears.  People who do drugs need drug dealers.  People who need work need employers.  And people who listen to over-hyped music with no talent (which appears to be the majority(904 reviews and counting; not even 2pac got this much) need artists like the aboved mentioned.  Are these artists geniuses?  Some would say yes and others would say no.  But they hit a string within American audiences and made lots of money.  So I say good shot.    If you are into hypes, trends, and simple music then give your two cents.  But if you made it far enough into your overall music experience this may not be nearly talented and entertaining enough for you.  
 I was halfway through this book and wanted to throw it against the wall,  it was that bad.  I have read her works before, and they were very good --  but not this one.  It was not scary at all.  The heroine was very  unlikeable--in fact everyone was.  I was definitely very disappointed in  this book 
 yo, this is garbage for now and forever. How can another weak muthaf@#ker diss another weak mf. No limit is garbage, yo hear that LIL p. See your face soon in the headlines "Garbage Reviewer Found Slain;Choked with a tank Chain". Get it straight homeboy, go buy Qb finest, Prodigy, CNN and Nature. Learn what this rap game is about 
 This is the second bad sourcebook I have paid good money for in the past few months (the Cityscape sourcebook was no good, either).  If you have Complete Adventurer, there is no need to pick this up.  Luck feats are interesting but no reason to buy an entire sourcebook.  The rest of it--there is not one prestige class in this I would ever play or even make a NPC out of, the new spells are lame and seem tossed in for filler, etc--is a complete loss.  
 This book is a scam.  He's trying to get people to sign up for his training program. The actual information in the book is minimally helpful. He charges $40 for you to read marketing tool for his business.  I have no doubt he also wrote these other glowing reviews of this book 
 This the first of Daninell's books I read.  I learnt that she was the Queen of romance novel since I was a teen.  I'm a little disappointed by the book because it's really boring for most of the part. It's like reading an alternative version of Princess Diana's traffic accident.  I realize that Daniell likes to repeat herself a lot.  There are too many reptitions of descriptions of all kinds.  It's also too predictable.  To me, everything that Bill did is really cheesy and unreal and his stubborness of rejecting and denying Anabelle after he became paralysed makes me wonder what a tyranny psycho he is that he just wants to inflict pain on the woman who loves him and who has nobody there for her at all. It's really hard to believe any man who acts so unreasonably stubborn on his own version of love and happiness that he can actually be an ideal partner for any woman.  Men like that are normally pretty controlling and emotionally abusive. This is the major element in the book that really turns me off.   I have to admit that the last part where Anabelle finally convinced Bill to be with her is quite touching.  I think Ms. Steel does have her crowds of fans.  My boyfriend's mother had been crying all the way thru the book.      
 I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid....I also read the book first and thought it was one of the best reads of my life....I recently bought a new copy of the book and still liked it very much....however I also recently purchased the movie version and it was TOTALLY laughable.....one of the worst movies I have ever seen.....so bad I suppose it could be a CULT CLASSIC in the same vein as ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES or REEFER MADNESS.....don't waste the money if you expect anything otherwise 
 There are far-better joke collections available in print, for those who wish the truly "hilarious".  Most of those in this tome, however, are merely tepid grin-makers, at best 
 Connie (or Connee) was the heart of the Boswell Sisters, the most entertaining and potent of the various sisters who were among recorded music's first, and most popular, stars. Their late 1920s-1930s recordings are full of snap, verve, charm and energy. Great voices blended together, with Connee leading, and some superlative arrangements, made those records sound as good today as they did when new. The  This pair of CDs offers nothing like those sprightly sounds. Lazy, even lugubrious, arrangements and tepid vocalizing create mostly dreary performances. The duos with Bing are better, but if you like the Sisters, as I do, this just ain't gonna cut it. If you like the Big Band sounds of the 40s, with a vocalist up front and a "pop" sound, maybe you'll like it better.   Compare her "Concentratin' on You" with the same song performed by Blanche Calloway. Blanche is crazed and confused, as the song requires, a woman intoxicated by love and incapable of living her day to day life. Connee sounds like an accountant describing the tax benefits of an offshore investment. Her Dinah, a favorite of mine from the Sisters, is a ho-hum afterthought. I bought this CD based on these other reviews, but I just don't much care for this sound. Sleepy, casual, and without conviction. No matter how good her voice was 
 It is worth going to Dealer. I read most of the stuff that I wanted to check in my car. It does not explain in layman's english. This is not a good book. Mine is sitting and dusting 
 Well, this is one of the more inventive books I've ever read.  It was difficult to plod through, however, I continued with the hope of a great reward at the end.  The reward was small.    For awhile I was being pulled along by curiosity.  After a few chapters I grew tired of the "game" and just had to try to keep myself from getting distracted so I could finish the book.  I'm glad I actually reached the end, but I'm not sure it was worth the effort.  I realize that more scholarly types think this book is spectacular.  I'm just an ordinary reader and I found it unenjoyable 
 Given the subject matter, one could hardly expect a high budget production but what Gangsta King delivers is little more than a modern day blaxploitation docu-flick.  Understandably Greg "Batman" Davis is seeking to portray Raymond Washington in a favorable light but putting it out that Raymond was totally against guns and never carried one is taking it abit far.  Contrary to legend, the crips were violent from day one as were the L.A. gangs which pre-dated their emergence.  The most interesting thing about this documentary is Batman's photographs beyond that this is one documentary you would be best served renting or borrowing from the library.  The historical recreations of past events is terrible due to poor acting and this sums up the rest of the video.  Low budget, low quality, low class 
 So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin.   There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural,  mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong.  
 The author explains that in the 1960s, Syrians would challenge Israel by shooting at Israelis who lived near the border.  Now, it may be obvious to him that no decent person ought to provoke people by living near a border, but it is not obvious to me.  Actually, what is obvious to me is that such attacks violate property rights and human rights.    In any case, Israel would fight back against these attacks by sending tractors into the area near the border.  These tractors would draw Syrian fire, after which the Israelis would shoot back.  Anyway, Bowen explains that the Israelis were not the only people who were violent.  Yes, "Israel set the pace, but the Arabs did their best to keep up with the violence."  He goes on to describe Arafat and his gang.  And I think that Arafat more than kept up with Israeli violence!    Is Bowen kidding?  The author also tells us that "Israel has poured money into colonizing the Occupied Territories, violating international law."    Actually, the West Bank is disputed territory.  If it violates international law for Jews to spend money there and live there, it violates international law for Arabs to spend money there and live there.  What Bowen is saying is simply false.    Oh, but there's worse.  Bowen also explains that Israel can prosper only if the Arabs suffer.  That's preposterous.    Is there anyone who might like such a book?  Maybe someone who truly believes that Arabs have a Divine Right, decreed by God Herself, to steal land as long as by so doing, they can deprive Jews of human rights.  Maybe the book will make sense to someone like that.  However, if you think truth has value, and if you think peace, justice, or human rights are worthwhile, this book is not for you 
 The product is so so, there are others that do the same thing for a bit less. But Colorvision thinks it owns the worlds so when it comes o support - you are screwed. Between putting you on hold for ever, not calling back etc. 
 I bought this book to see what is the fuss is all about, this book claimed "Matering Astral Projection".  But I wonder if the author clearly knowing what is astral projection.  Read more other books, then you will be able to tell the difference. Mr Bruce has never seen another other beings or even divine beings during astral projections, this is well known abilities in astral projection filed, but he got none of these skills.  Sorry, this book is failure.  Do not waste your money on this book 
 I am a thirty-something, pretty hip, pretty shapely Californian, and there is not one pattern in this book that I would wear, let alone spend the time knitting. "Sexy" is a misnomer -- "trashy" would be better. I was hoping for some non-dumpy-looking sweaters and flattering garments, and instead I got see-through tops, peek-a-boo swimsuits, and bare midriffs galore. The only person I know who has the body to get away with this stuff is my 14-year-old niece, and her mom wouldn't let her out of the house wearing anything in this book! Save your money. Wrap yourself in cellophane and save yourself the trouble of getting out your needles. 
 The first twenty pages of the book quickly sparks your interest but soon after that, the story drags until it picks back up again toward the last third of the book.  I think the story would have been more credible if Barr would have thoroughly explored the inner workings of her fictional religious sect and offered more details about it.  Without those details, the book seemed "unfinished".  It was like watching a movie and only viewing the actions of the good guy without being exposed to villain.  Boring in my opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                            
 Like I've said in some of my eariler reviews, sometimes this is just no fun at all. Whilst it's always funny to rip into, say, Pop Idol or something, here it's just... sad.  The Ultimate series of Marvel comics was a potentially awful idea done to surprisingly awesome effect. Taking the well worn ideas and characters from the Marvel Universe, going straight back to square one and re-imagining the origins and original characters could well have blown up in the writers faces. But not so. The writing in some of these books is simply superb, and sometimes makes the impossible seem scarily possible. Ultimate Spider-Man, of course, is a constant delight, with top class banter, witty one-liners and some brutal action (with the exception of the heartbreakingly average Venom and Carnage re-do's), and then there's the Ultimates (the Avengers) and... oooh, oodles more. Like I said - top idea.  But not here. Again, the characters are made teenagers, which is fine for, say, Spidey, who WAS a teenager in the first place, but a sixteen/seventeen year old Ben Grimm just doesn't cut it. Also, the script lacks major bite. After what we've seen with Spidey et al, we really do need something special to warrant another spin on the Marvel franchise (especially for its oldest family) and there's nothing here that excites or, crucially, convinces. In short, it just makes you pine for the original books.  The most galling thing though, is the sham that is Dr Doom (or, I'm sorry, Dr Damme). Change what you like from the original comics guys; the crummy banter, some dodgy storylines, but DO NOT REPLACE the original character names. So, what, a guy called Victor Von Doom isn't realistic, but having a THIRTEEN YEAR OLD BOY design and build the Fantasti-Car, an interdimensional rocket ship, is??  As the Human Torch himself said, "dude.. that's Fantasti-crappy."  I won't be buying THIS junk anymore.  The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.u 
 Gave up after 64 pages, what a sham, the heroic hero calls his SEAL buddy Harry, the man's name is Dan Harris, the President is called Woody for no explained reason as his name is Robert X. Hayes, Ramstein Air Base, Germany is called Ramstein Air Force Base, the White House security people will let just anyone in to see the Pres, you can't be serious, "the hero's lean biceps bulged under the fabric of his black polo shirt he was wearing" did we have to be told that he was wearing the shirt after being told of the bulging business, either consign this joke to the trash can or give it to a person that you really dislike. Minus 3 stars 
    I originally bought this title when it came out as a four-part mini series in 1997 and it is still one of the favorites in my collection.     Kingdome Come is an Elseworlds (what if) story set approximately ten years after the retirement of Superman and subsequently nearly every other super hero. As the story unfolds, the reason Superman quit is revealed. A rival hero named Magog killed the Joker and was put on trial for murder. When the public cried out for his aquittal and it was granted, Superman quit in disgust. The results of the public choosing a hero that would kill are very apparent in the future.     The children of the super heroes we know are everywhere. They hold society in a state of terror as they enforce justice and fight each other in the way they see fit, destroying property and causing chaos. Wonder Woman approaches Superman in his self-imposed exile in the nuclear wastleland that is Kansas and asks him to return and lead the former heroes in returning order.     When Superman returns to the public eye in issue #2, it sets into motion an Apocalypse as described in the Bible, but with Superheroes being the catalyst. The new Justice League rounds up every violent super human and puts them into a prison designed by Mister Miracle(The world's greatest escape artist) called the Gulag. All this is shown from the viewpoint of Norman McCray, a disillusioned pastor and friend of the Golden Age Sandman. He is led on his journey by the Spectre (DC's Angel of Death)    I absolutely love this story by Mark Waid, the way he wraps comic characters and events into a Biblical epic is brilliant. The painted art by Alex Ross is jaw-dropping in it's realism. The re-imagined characters are god-like in their depiction, especially the Flash- a red blur wrapped in lightning wearing a winged Greek helmet.    Issue #3 ends in a cliff-hanger with all the villains rioting and breaking out of the Gulag. As Superman races to the scene, he is thrown to the ground by the only person that could, Captain Marvel. I still remember waiting for issue #4 to come out.     The fight scene between Captain Marvel and Superman was voted #1 all-time by Wizard magazine and is worth the price of this trade alone. Even  without this fight scene, I would rate this as one of the ten greatest mini-series ever, but with it Kingdom Come is #1.   The only possible negative to this series is that you have to already know something about comics to fully appreciate all the subtleties Waid and Ross weave into this story. Nearly every DC character is pictured at least once.(A geek's paradise I guess) After reading this I actually liked Captain Marvel, who I had always seen as an even cheesier version of Superman. The fear the other heroes have of him and his power level make him hard to laugh at, despite Jerry Ordway's Power of Shazam monthly series to the contrary.   I hope my description of the story has led any undecided mind to pick this up. Fabulous art and incredible writing. (This should be 5 stars, but I can't seem to edit my rating 
 Now I know that there is a difference a BIG difference between a songwriter, poet and comedian. I know this book is not intended to be funny, but to me the poetry "It is poetry:thoughts" was just funny to me. I cannot give this book a fair rating because it is not a fair book. When will songwriter, actors, atheletes,models whatever! realize that just because they are good at one thing, doesn't mean that they are good at the other! God help the corporate/mainstream talent industry 
 I bought the ADS upconverter because I bought a HDTV only to find out that my cable co. didn't offer HDTV and after 3 failed attempts to switch to a satellite provider that did offer HDTV (too many trees around my house).  I wasn't expecting the upconverter to magically turn my standard signals into an amazing HDTV picture, but for $550+ I was expecting the upconverter to do something that was actually noticable.  When I first turned in on I asked my wife to look at the picture and tell me what she thought.  She looked at the TV and said okay I'm ready turn it on.  I said "it IS ON!!" This is pretty much the reaction I had also when I looked at it.  The image I got for my digital cable was certianly different, but that's all it was, different.  It was NOT noticably better.  In fact, in some instances I though the picture was worse.  I called ADS tech support and they kept insisting I try it with my DVD because that is what the product is best for (even though that's not what I got it for).  So I did and to be honest I really preferred the picture I got directly from my DVD over the picture I got after running it thru the upconverter.  It didn't matter what display format I put it in it just didn't do anything to improve the picture.  Save your money.  If you can't get HDTV don't expect this box to give you anything close to the next best thing 
 Systemic Mechanic 6 seemed to be helping, since it handled a lot of the advertised functions well.   However, the "repair broken shortcuts" function does not work properly.    For a variety of reasons I use a large number of Microsoft Word Shortcuts in my Folder/ File  system.   System Mechanic "repaired broken shortcuts" on a large number of my short-cutted documents by directing the shortcut from the correct file target to the wrong file target.   Now I am pulling up documents which are similar ( but are actually older versions which I have save to an auxiliary hard drive ) or unrelated to the actual, correct target file. This has had severe productivity consequences,  since I have to double check the target of every file opened via a shortcut.  Contacting on-line Help was of no help whatsoever.   
 This is a deep and complex book. And unless you're really committed I wouldn't reccomend getting into this.

 Adams covers the same info that Conrad and Baker discuss but with a tone of condescension and puritanism that blankets the text like a fine scum of oil over water. Halfway though the book I wanted to curse him; after listening to his boorish and uninspired NPR interview I wanted to punch his lights out. If you like feeling superior, this book is for you. Otherwise stick with Conrad 
 It was not as good as I expected.  I felt the quality of this item was cheap.  Therefore, I returned it 
 This book appears to be useful only for secondary teachers.  That was not stated in any of the information about the book and I would not have purchased it had I known.  The author should have thought of that in the title, since its not what every teacher needs to know, but only secondary teachers.  Its was not useful at all for people at the elementary level 
 Amartya Sen is a serious economist, who has some serious ideas, but they are not in this book.  The book purports to be an philosophical/economic argument for "freedom now" as both the means and the goal of economic and social policy, and an argument against the postponement of "freedom" until after "purely" economic development has occurred.    Freedom, Sen claims -and not merely wealth or the rule of law- is the best vehicle to promote...well...freedom itself.  If this reasoning sounds circular to you, you are not alone.  On one interpretation, this strikes me as trivially true.  Sure: promote freedom and you will indeed get freedom.  If, on the other hand, Sen is stating that freedom is "the solution" to global poverty, his thesis is dubious at best.  And this is especially so because Sen's book is NOT really a polemic against Confucian statism (i.e. the "Lee thesis"), it is a polemic against economic liberalism.  Lee is just a straw man used to advance Sen's more fundamental claim: that freedom -properly understood- is actually what he refers to as "capability."  In other words: freedom is not merely the absence of external constraints, but the capability to accomplish things in the world.  This is NOT "Development as Freedom" but rather "Freedom as Capability."  And this is where Sen really loses me.  Even IF "capability" is a quantifiable, measureable, controllable, predictable variable that can be maximized (extremely dubious, since the list of possible verbs of which one can be capable is practically infinite), this argument is nothing even remotely new.  Sen's allegedly groundbreaking discovery is simply the modern incarnation of Isaiah Berlin's "positive freedom," FDR's "freedom from want," and the other muddled reinventions of the concept of "freedom" which together date back to the early Counter-Enlightenment.    These ideas sound like doublethink because they are doublethink.  Public health care and make-work jobs simply do not leap to mind when one thinks of "freedom" - if they did, there would be no need for this book.  The conceptual epitome of "freedom" is one's release from prison.  That's not the necessarily the "capability" to do anything.  If we want to discuss welfare economics, on the other hand, that's fine -- but let's not confuse our students by misappropriating the language of liberty.  But I am not deterred from this work merely by the fact that I disagree with Sen's thesis.  In the end, I am turned off by the massive acclaim this book has recieved, despite its glaring intellectual mushiness.  Sen has supplanted Marx as the English professor's favorite economist, distracting attention from those thinkers whose ideas might actually make a modest difference in combating global poverty 
 This potty is completely useless.  It is so small that my three years olds' knees are up by his shoulders when he sits on it.  It is unstable on those little plastic legs and it's opening is too small for their little bottoms and it hurts them to sit on it.  This potty only stands about four inches off the ground so unless your toddler is the size of a six month old this thing is useless 
 Self proclamation does not a doctor make.  Dr Laura's credential's are not within the field of psychotherapy-she who preaches so loudly from her pulpit about family ties and togetherness, has been estranged from her own family for years.  She who points the finger---has also had the finger pointed at her.  Posing nude, living with a man without the benefit of marriage, having an affair, becoming pregnant without the benefit of marriage, have all been written about Dr. Laura Schlessinger and made public.  Noone willingly takes the advice of a hypocrite, unless of course, they hide behind a syndicated radio show and a willing agent 
 I can't stand this movie, it's one of the worset.   The acting is horrible, it's dark, gloomy, and so boring. It's fun to watch and make fun of it, but thats about all. I do not recommend it, I would give it zero stars if it was possible.   The child actress "mary" and then the older grown up "mary" actress isn't suitable, she doesn't even look like she could have been the same person or type, how awful! Watch another version, this one is a waste of time and money! 
 The other review on this book by "a reader" is very helpful and I recomend you read it as well as this review.  I have taken fifteen CLEP tests and am very familiar with how to study for the test.  CLEP tests by their very nature a designed to see if the student has a sufficient grasp on the given subject. On tests like American literature or Humanities which cover a wide variety of different works/toppics,  I've found that it's best to study the main points and key elements of the subject instead of spending a whole year trying to read a huge list of books.  I would not recomend Rudman's book, however, I would recomend buying the Barron's EZ key's for American Literature.  It will help you get a quick grasp on what this subject covers.  Also, the Official Clep study guide is a great tool for preparing for the tests 
 This is absolutely sick- it's been recommended that children under one year of age not be subjected to ANY video at all, but this is intended to force creationism on babies barely old enough to think at all???  I shudder to think of what outcome this will have in a few years 
 After reading the reviews on this table we thought we would gamble. We were very disappointed.  The packaging arrived torn and open in several places. Only a few screws came with the table, not that this made much difference as there were table parts missing too. The parts that did arrive were chipped practically in every corner and the paint rubbed off. Amazon were efficient in having the item picked up for return and refund 
 If you know nothing about CSS and you can find an inexpensive copy, this book will get you started, but there have to be better "get started" books. Probably good if someone needs a lot of simple, explicit examples though. The one place I had high hopes for the book was near the end where it dealt with using CSS to format "printer friendly" pages. I'm sure the code was OK, but there was no example of how to link a page formatted for the screen to one formatted for the printer. I was expecting some example of loading a second Style Sheet using the same page code. 
 Beware!  This CD is only the background music from the movie, none of the good songs or even vocal overlays.  It is a supreme disapointment 
 If you own cats, and are interested enough in cats to actually buy and read this book, the only things that will strike you as new ideas are Newkirk's dogmatic beliefs about the welfare of our feline friends.  As a long-time vegetarian, bordering vegan, I have little problem with the suggestion that cats can be mostly vegetarian. However, a strict vegetarian diet isn't best for *most* cats, and can cause - in some cats, particularly males - struvite crystals in the bladder which are excreted, painfully, in their urine. This is because a plant diet does not have the acidity that a meat diet has - not because of a deficiency in protein, fat, or nutrients - as some reviewers suggest. Specially formulated, highly acidic brewer's yeast can help in this area, but a fail-safe method is to incorporate small amounts of meat, and do a heck of a lot of research. For example, our cats are pesco-vegetarians, and thrive on a diet of Evolution dry kibble - with small amounts of salmon or tuna every few days.   My biggest problem with Newkirk's take on cats is that they should be kept 100% indoors, and the assertion that death (is that the 250th thing you can do to make your cat adore you?) is a preferable alternative to allowing a cat to roam outdoors. I imagine Newkirk doesn't have children, and this is a lucky thing, because she would likely lock them in a padded cell for fear that they might stub their toe. Or maybe she'd just kindly euthanize them? Eeks. Not all cats are happy being indoor cats, and one has to decide if the possibility of death, perhaps in painful circumstances, is worth the risk when this is the cat's inclination and the only way some cats are truly happy.   Of course this doctrine comes from an animal rights group that has been noted for euthanising 85% of the animals it takes in - a far greater number than many public animal shelters (San Francisco Chronicle, June 23, 2005). And that, honestly, is my biggest gripe with this book, and with PETA in general. Hypocrisy of this sort - PETA is riddled with it - leaves me feeling we have the wrong group representing the rights of companion and farm animals, and that ultimately Newkirk's poorly researched, dogmatic ideas leave us all (animals rights activists) looking like a bunch of nuts 
 SO here we go again, yet another attempt to rip us, the FANS, off. I don't care what novice reviewer has to type, I checked my old VHS tapes for Homicide episodes and the picture was 100% clearer then what is released on DVD.  Sure some douche will spring up, "the picture was made to be grainy" , no kidding Holmes, but to compare what was released on TV and from a VHS source to the UPDATED DVD format, there is no contest. NBC and A&E have done a piss poor job at releasing the series onto DVD. First off last season which was arguably the best of the shows run, was a waste of money. SEASON 6 included two, TWO-HOUR double episodes. The first SOMETHING SACRED dealing with the murder of priests, which was originally shown in a two hour block, but was split for DVD. Ok...that one was on the house. The most painful of the two was FALLEN HEROES. What was originally released in two parts, was re released at the beginning of Season 7 in a two hour movie which included some really awesome footage put back in. Including a scene introducing Gharty's wife and which also included more violence which added to the horror of the what was happening.  But what were we given for $99 bucks, (at Best Buy) the best of the series SPLIT in two without the inclusion of those scenes. I mean in each box set, which aren't that cheap mind you, we're treated to a boring behind the scenes and some thrown together commentary...which doesn't even include cast members. I think season 5 had Clark Johnson but he was commenting more from a directors stand point. And finally a dumb thrown together "MUSIC from the show" menu. Which anyone who is a fan or admirer of the show has already gotten from someones else's WEBSITE while the show was still on the AIR! Oh and NO DELETED SCENES? My ass. I mean we're not even treated to a GREAT PICTURE let alone a truly surround sound experience.  I mean...was that too much to ask? Were the other cast members too busy right now to join up for 45 minutes to talk about the show? I mean where is all that footage from the Homicide conventions that happened? I mean this is one of the greatest if not the GREATEST police shows ever to be produced and yet they don't care enough to produce a great DVD.  Oh but CHARLES IN CHARGE SEASON 1 gets the works. I mean compared to THE SHIELD, Homicide looks like blues clues, but is still amazing to watch and to see how the show progressed, even then was ahead of it's time. Homicide was one of the first to include music as a drive for scenes which many have copied newer example being COLD CASE.  So now here we are with Season 7 DVD box set. Of course I will waste my hard earned dough for the set, only because this is the only way to get them. But is it really worth the price tag? NO. Better luck finding complete episodes on VHS and copy your own to DVD. And you can truly say you've put more time and energy into it than A&E or NBC has. Sorry for those of you who find this negative, but after Season 6 being cut short, never to have those full length shows again...I feel cheated and used. I mean I even had to make my own SOUNDTRACK because there never was one released. Oh but if you want, rush out and pick of the JOAN OF ARCADIA soundtrack...gimme a break. Hope this was helpful. B 
 I have worked out to Denise Austin for several years because I think she gives a good workout BUT I CANNOT stand her way-too-perky personality. I was very disappointed in this dance workout. The setting is fun and colorful and the music is great, but as far as a workout...this dvd really stinks. I found some of the steps somewhat confusing (but I am NOT very coordinated). This workout was more of an "indoor walk" style workout (like Walk Away the Pounds w/ Leslie Sansone, etc.). If you are looking for a fun way to get up and move, this may be for you. BUT, this is not for anyone looking for a cardio intense workout 
 The book teaches to cultivate some easily orchids found at especialized stores. The photos need to have more ligth, many are dark; its a book indicated only for beginners. It was not that waited 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 Although the pack looks OK at first glance, a seam at the top ripped the first time I used it....I'm returning it 
 These guyz totally suck ballllzzzz. They can't play. They can't even spell their name write. Shouldnt it be MegaDEATH? Losers. And they play solos, but they sound like their just moving there fingers all over the guitar  strings. And they have LONG HAIR!!!! That's the worst part. Listen to good music like Fall Out Boy and Dashboard Confessional!!! 
      Compared to Kimmel's brilliant first novel,"Solace..."  this reads like a labored Writing Class assignment: "Write a piece about a woman pool hustler, and make her an angry, masculine, drywaller whose redneck mother alludes to Kundera, Randall Jarrell, Marianne Moore, Anne Sexton, Martin Amis in the space of 2 pages."        Kimmel has a thing about frustrated intellectual housewives (the mothers, Laura, here and Annalee in "Solace...") who never went to college yet worship at the alter of Thought and Literature.  Usually one kid goes to Bloomington to become a neurotic pointy-head while the other makes meth in the barn or practices tire-iron road rage while Seeking The Absent Father.  Throw in some depth psychology and pages of pointless and unbelievable STRIFE, and you eventually get to the end of the exercise.        The pasted-on New Orleans Good Ending is OK only because we can hope that Hurricane Katrina has wiped out Haven's fictional Pool Hall Heaven paid for by deus ex machina.  By the way, Cassie, the lumpy heroine whose outlawry consists of having uninteresting pot-smoking friends and never paying income tax, supposedly inherits a $300G stock and insurance settlement and the lawyer hands it over in cash and takes out no taxes?       Haven needs to have people who aren't in awe of her to read the drafts of her future novels. She is way too talented to wing it just because she had a great first novel. She needs better advisors/editors 
 For the second time, I tried to read a Sallis book and for the second time gave up half way through.  He does have a nice turn of phrase, and that's what brought me back for another try.   Unfortunately, style is clearly his primary focus, leaving the balance of his writing in the two books in this series to shallow story line and characterization.  As a result, while the reader may be entertained by the author's style, there's no depth of story or characters to hold his curiosity. At least this time around Sallis didn't serve up another gooey helping of his syrupy-sweet (and Walt Disney phony) view of the Deep South, as he did in "Cypress Grove" 
 This has been rewritten to dumb it down.  The beautiful language originally used by him has been replaced with dumber versions, and entire paragraphs have been removed.  As someone who read and loved the original story as a child, I was very disappointed to see this when I began reading it to my 7 year old son 
 I don't even know where to start.   If she wasn't so (as we are constantly reminded) well-educated and well travelled I would assume that the author just didn't know how to be a gracious guest. Instead of relishing this rare hospitality (Amish families very rarely invite Englisch guests to stay with them) she repeatedly criticizes her first host family (the wife isn't fit enough, the food isn't healthy enough, her room isn't big enough.) Then when a second family allows her to stay with them she thinks that being their guest for two weeks means she has a right to belittle their plans to expand their homestead to included a much needed birthing center for the community. And to top it all off, when she gets home, she's too special to share her experiences with regular people, and now thinks the people who were previously her social peers are like "sharks."  This book is not worth your time. There are several excellent books that include far more insight into the lives of the Amish and far less over-intellectualized, self-centered, whining and condescension. See "Driving the Amish" by Jim Butterfield 
 This must be one of the latest entries in the Dan Brown school of writing. Name an expert, assign an audience, lecture on historical points and expect applause at the end. Well, Kathy Reichs can wait for a long time. There will be no applause for this book. I would like my money back. I'm almost finished and still can't really figure out what the plot actually is. I guess she will just pop the final lecture and the conclusion will name the murderer. What about motive, character development (sex + history), etc... This is my first novel by this author and it will be my last 
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 I bought this cookbook expecting it to have a few fun, easy recipes for wraps that I could toss together with stuff I had around the kitchen.  Although the recipes and certainly the pictures look delicious, fun and easy they're not.  It's not uncommon for recipes to have over a dozen  ingredients.  When I want to toss together a little lunch, I don't have  time to track down 1/4 cup chopped pickled ginger or 2 cups cooked jasmine  rice or 1/4 teaspoon orange oil.  I have yet to make a single recipe from  this book, despite having owned it for over nine months 
 I could not finish this because it was written from such a negative and downbeat perspective 
 Was expecting something dynamic and subtle - the theme presented a great opportunity, apparently not up to the writer's capabiliities at all.  This book is silly and just not worth the read time 
 Shugart's 'Price Guide' has received some flack in Amazon's past reviews. However flawed, it's still the gold standard for valuing timepieces. I found Judy's book both disjointed in its organization, and naive in its assessment of watch pricing. Bottom line; if you're looking for a coffee table book with some pretty pictures, '100 Years of Vintage Watches' will fit the bill. If you buy, sell, or collect watches, stick with Shugart 
 I bought this based on the reviews here on Amazon - and I'm sorry that I did. It doesn't contain any valuable information and the organization is odd for a guidebook. I just don't see the point of this guidebook 
 I liked this machine while it worked, but I started having problems finalizing discs a bit ago.  I got busy and suddenly the warranty was up, and then the other day, it just wouldn't turn on at all.  I had it for 15 months 
 As others have commented, very poor workmanship. The first pitter I had lost the pin on its third pitting round. Hammered it back in but didn't last. The next season I needed one quickly but couldn't find a different one, so bought it again. The pin was lost during the first use. I have no idea why all local stores seem to carry just this pitter 
 Not for the entrepreneur or small business owner.  What this book tries to do is make it seem possible to start up a tour business without much capital.  It glosses over crucial parts in starting a business, especially financing.  Misleading and not up to par with what you would expect from a Small Business magazine 
 I visited Ireland from the U.S. and my hair dryer sparked when I used the adapter and fried both of them. Also I had a convertor for my iPod, but was unable then to use the adapter. The USB charger never worked. Oh well, live and learn. 
 Not sure about this one. Really enjoyed the Woman in White. I found this one a little tedious and slow quite despite the  very high esteem in which it is held by Wilkie fans.   
 Books ignores many places in Arizona. Nothing on Lake Havasu, Kingman, Oatman, Yuma, ShowLow, Pinetop, Payson, Mogollon Rim and nothing on cover of book, front or back, indicates it selectively covers state 
 I agree with the previous reviewer - there is a lot of static and interference with these things.  We actually hardly ever use them for that reason - our house is small enough that we can hear the music from the other room through walls and doorways, and at least it doesn't sound like an AM radio on a stormy day. Also, they do have huge "wall warts" - the big converters (?) on the cords.  Finding an inconspicuous place to plug them in is impossible, since all the inconspicuous places are behind furniture, which can't be put close to the wall anymore for the size of the things on the plugs.  I guess you get what you pay for - I would have paid more if I had known how bad these would be 
 VNV Nation is a terrible example of the music i love. Their compostition is weak, repetitive and slow. The pentamiter of the lyrics does not match with rythym or bass. The vocals are slow sloppy and untalented. Listening to this vocalist is like listening to the jaw bone of a donkey being scraped along a chalk board in a wide hallway. 
 The film deserves 5 stars but the DVD only gets 1.  Why:  no letterbox format.  After waiting years for this fabulous film to come out on DVD, why would they give us full screen / pan & scan?  Yes, the quality and color are great but oh, what we're missing on the sidelines 
 Honestly I'm surprised by most of the reviews I see here giving this book 5 stars. Most of the people in the book, I personally don't hold in the highest regard. They all seem "past their prime" and many sound like they are remeniscing on how it used to be. In terms of the books title "Insider reveal their creative secrets." .. I find this laughable. I've read through the entire book, and there are very few concrete, CLEAR ideas on how to improve your musical craft. If you're a person that likes to learn through explicit instruction, then this book is definitely not for you. If you simply want to read interviews from some semi-relevant people that were in the music biz at one time, then this book may be for you. I would highly recommend going to your local bookstore and scanning through a few pages before spending your money 
 As a strong proponent of attachment parenting and a rather radical unschooler, this book was a BIG disappointment!!! I bought this book after reading the reviews and wish I hadn't paid more than $1 for it. While the title "The Unprocessed Child" accurately describes Laurie's upbringing, this book shouldn't be grouped with other unschooling literature. The author, while cherishing the close bond she has with her daughter, reminds me of the mother in "Love You Forever" who sneaks across town and climbs into her grown son's room at night to spend time with him--sweet but a bit creepy. The fact that she admits that she even went to college at the same time as her daughter so she could spend more time with Laurie pretty much says it all. The mother clearly has her own issues that I hope she allows herself to work through and heal from now that she's not spending 24/7 with her only child. We have been unschooling each of our four children since birth --challenging temperments and all--and I feel very privileged to spend so much time with them as they discover how exciting it is to decode and discover the world around them. If you want to read a GOOD book about unschooling without unsupported platitudes and preaching in almost every chapter, I would recommend "Homeschooling our Children, Unschooling Ourselves". Those authors offer more balance and eloquence than Ms. Fitzenreiter. 
 I got a copy of Sundown Towns, after a guy that I occasionally walk with in the early morning told me about the book.  When I went to check the book out, I discussed it in part with the library clerk and another woman. The clerk stated our small town was mentioned in Sundown Towns, and thought the book had been incorrectly researched. Since I'm one of those people that still believe non-fiction should be told as correctly (and truthfully) as possible, I immediately started reading. First page, Chapter One, had me wondering right off the bat.  Having read Professor Loewen's credentials, I must say I was a bit disappointed.  And if he relied only on information he obtained from a convenience store clerk, then he and I haven't gotten off on the right foot. In order not to confuse anyone that might happen to read this review, let me quote Loewen's conversation with the clerk:  	Is it true that `ANNA' stands for `Ain't No Niggers Allowed?" I asked at the  	convenience store in Anna, Illinois, where I had stopped to buy coffee. 		"Yes," the clerk replied.  "That's sad, isn't it," she added, distancing 	herself from the policy.  And she went on to assure me, "That all happened 	a long time ago." 		"I understand [racial exclusion] is still going on?" I asked. 		"Yes," she replied.  "That's sad."  NOW, from the HISTORY of ALEXANDER, UNION AND PULASKI COUNTIES, ILLINOIS on page 371-72 of Part II, Chapter XIV, clearly states how Anna, Illinois came to be named ANNA, which reads:  	During the year of 1853, Winstead Davie, who then owned the most of the land which is now the site of the city of Anna, and Col. Lewis W. Ashley, Division Engineer, who had come into possession of a portion of the same tract, determined to lay out a town at this point.  The proper surveys were made by Francis H. Brown, the County Surveyor, and lots were laid out on both sides of Main Street and the railroad.  Mr. Davie decided to name the town in honor of his beloved wife, ANNA, and under this name, the plat was entered upon the county records on March 3, 1854. 	 To include such a statement that Loewen used to begin his non-fiction book, I would have definitely sought a more reliable source of information than a convenience store clerk, who may or may not have known the correct answer to his question in the first place, but didn't want to appear stupid, especially if he had bothered to introduce himself.  And that's enough said about this part of Sundown Towns. I then went to the book's index and looked up the small town where I live.  I turned to page 187 and there it was, in black and white.  Loewen writes that "according to Robyn Williams, a nearby teacher, Eldorado sported a sundown sign until the 1980s. (Unfamiliar with the term `nearby teacher', I assume a NEARBY teacher is one that does not teach in Eldorado, but in a NEARBY town).  Again, I discussed this statement with other life-long residents, and to the best of everyone's recollection, no such `sundown town' sign existed in the 50s, 60s, 70s, or 80s.  I was, however, told by my mother (another life-long resident) that once upon a time, such a sign was displayed on the edge of Eldorado. When it was removed, I cannot say for sure. But certainly, it was not sported until the 1980s, as Loewen has written, or a nearby teacher stated. Eldorado is a small, close knit town, where very little happens that goes unnoticed.  I won't dispute Loewen's next statement about a white couple adopting a biracial child, and then had raw sewage thrown on their lawn, and other problems that caused them to leave town shortly thereafter.  BUT, I've never heard that story before either. There is a couple that adopted two African American children a long time ago. They still live in Eldorado, the children attended the local schools for twelve years, and to my knowledge they were never mistreated. If Loewen is intent on writing about how the white man has, over the years, mistreated those of a different color and ethnicity, then perhaps he should rely more on the history books that have already been written, instead of consulting convenience store clerks and nearby teachers, who are probably either too young to know, too far removed, or else too ignorant of the facts to comment one way or the other. But no matter what he writes, and God knows he must have spent a great deal of time putting this book together, he should be more certain of the facts. There's enough racial dissension in the world today without authors like Loewen writing books that could possibly create more. 	     	      This type of writing makes southern Illinois look bad enough, but for someone who has never lived here and isn't familiar with the area, to write incorrectly about it, then I guess that really bothers me.  No doubt, my sentiments show in this review. History has painted a very unfavorable picture of the white man's treatment of African Americans and other minority groups, and it is quite sad.  But what, if anything, can we hope to gain if we continue to "pour salt in the wounds", expressing that this very situation still exists today.  Then again, there was a Hurricane Katrina. 	 
 I too was required to read this book in the 6th grade.  I couldn't understand how this book could be an award then or now.  I'm a huge Eckert fan, but this story just doesn't cut the mustard.  For a better Eckert book, check out Johnny Logan 
 I got this CD player because I thought sony was a good company, plus I liked the look of it. But after just 5 months after purchase, and not even using it that often, it has already broken. I paid about 40 dollars for this CD player, so I am very disappointed. If I were you, I would buy a different CD player

As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 I had this one figured out by the second chapter. Too predictable and shallow. Hopefully, the next Stone book will actually be worth reading 
 The noise problem with this camera is horrendous.  DO NOT BUY IT!  If you take a close-up picture of an eye you will not be able to see the eyelashes clearly... NEVER.  NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY.  My 3-year old 5MPX Sony is much better than this Panasonic camera.  I am sorry I bought it. I would return this product if I could and buy a good camera instead.  The Lumix DMC-LX2 camera cannot focus one bit, many pictures are out of focus and made worse by the noise problem.  Even with the motion smother function turned on many pictures come out blurred.  Noise is very noticeable with graininess appearing very readily.  You can tweak the quality enhancing features for sharpness, noise reduction, contrast and saturation all you want but these are worthless to reduce the noice and sharpness problem.  The Amazon website says you can use standard SD memory which is untrue(perhaps this has been corrected now).  The camera only accepts more expensive SDHC (high capacity) cards.  These SDHC cards cannot be read by standard memory stick readers so I have to use the USB port which takes forever to download even a handful of pictures to my computer. 
 I've read (or tried to read) this book three times over the course of several months.  I am displeased on several levels.  I want to let people know other books are far better.    Lousy formatting and lack of grammar lead me to determine this book has been published by novices.  I would not be so upset, except the content is questionable too, not just the format.  At best, this book is NOT a reference work (because it is SO hard to follow a train of thought).  I wonder about the other publications of Two Plus Two Publishing?     Advanced poker advice given here is for folks NOT interested in statistics or numbers.  I feel obligated to inform readers that Sklansky's "Hand Groupings" are arbitrary--they have nothing to do with statistical chances of winning.   The most irritating aspect of this book is the constant advertisement for other Sklansky books.  Comments like, "For those of you who are interested in the rationale behind these rankings, see HOLD EM POKER by David Sklansky" (Sklansky 2005:17) reinforce my money was NOT well-spent in buying this book 
 I made sure I did my research and read all the reviews on various cameras before deciding to go with this one.  I was highly disappointed when I got my camera home and put in the batteries, turned it on and immediately  the lens got stuck in the "out" position with an error reading that said:  lens error, restart camera.  I tried to restart it a zillion times, only for it to say the same thing.  I went on line and found that this is a problem with some canon cameras and now, instead of being excited about having this particular camera, I am completely disappointed.    I'm glad others have had such good luck with their cameras.  Please research the error because, in some cases, it didn't happen until a year later 
 I'm not sure which versions other reviewers are seeing, but mine from Blue Underground is "Unrated".  I guess this is because they really didn't want people to know it should have been rated PG-13.  If women in panties and fuzzy breast shots are your thing, then get this movie.  Half the fun of campy women in prison movies is naked women.  The other half is following along with a silly plot.  This movie was boring on both accounts 
 The name Sylvia Brown sounded vaguely familiar to me when a friend of mine told me about this book and borrowed it to me so that I could read it.  She grew up in a non-religious household and seemed eager for something to believe, and so she enthusiastically recommended it to me.  I suppose I fit comfortably into that category of people that "believers" classify as "skeptics," and I am amazed by some of the reviews for this book that recommend it to all skeptics, saying that it will make a believer out of them.  It will not.  If anything, it just strengthened my skepticism of this type of...belief system, if that's what one could call it.  My biggest gripe about Sylvia's "religion" is that it tells gullible, grief-stricken people who have lost friends or relatives exactly what they want to hear.  I don't think I could have come up with a more appealing, happy-ending scenario for life and death if I tried.  But believing that you got a new car for Christmas just because that's what you really really wanted doesn't make it true.  Other gripes: I got the impression that Sylvia is somewhat (if not very) self-important.  If she can't go and pick winning lottery numbers because you can't use your "gift" for selfish reasons, why not donate the money to charity?  How can the surface of the "other side" be three feet above our own (that's why ghosts appear to float, of course) and infinite, whereas earth is of finite size?  And what is with this whole New Age vibrational frequency thing anyway?  What exactly is supposed to be vibrating?  If this is the best that the New Age religious/spiritual movement has to offer, I think I'll look elsewhere 
 "Waiting For Your Cat To Bark" wins this year's "The book I couldn't wait to put down" award.  Honestly, the only reason I bought the book was because I absolutely adore the writing of Roy Williams, and he recommend it for about six-months pre-publish -- the Eisenberg boys are his prize students. (Turns out, Roy's brilliance as a writer is equaled by the rose of his glasses.)  My experience with "Cat," however, did confirm several things:  1. Robert B. Cialdini's theory that people generally remain consistent with previous choices despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. (I can't imagine any other reason so many people are giving this book 5 stars.) In truth, I was so pre-sold by Williams that even as I found myself falling asleep reading Cat, I was telling others how great it was. (Then somewhere around page 50 I realized what an idiot I was being and shut up about it.)  2. Great marketing can get people to buy anything, and Roy Williams is one of the best there is. The fact that Cat hit the bestseller list is more a testimony to his marketing genius than to Cat authors' writing ability.   3. My theory that it's the quality of one's sales pitch that gets a book professionally published, not the quality of one's writing. (Anyone else noticed how many crappy books are getting published these days? When are publishers going to go back to reading a full manuscript before committing to putting a book on the shelves?)  4. That the Eisenberg brothers over-learned and over-applied William's advice to invent your own words and jargon. Thank God other reviewers quoted all their superfluff terms -- it saved me from having to retrieve them from the depths of my purposeful forgetfulness.  This book is a marketing brochure for two guys who, seemingly, do understand internet marketing. It's just a shame they don't know how to, or didn't want to, write about it so others could actually learn from their experiences 
 Ann's books are amusing, informative, thought provoking, and full of sarcasm to be sure, but at least she backs up her thoughts with logic, explanation, and evidence. Using facts and evidence to make arguments is rare for liberals, which is why they tend not to address issues, and use personal attacks to make their points.  Ann's comments about the 9/11 widows wasn't really against the widow's per se, it was a comment about the inability of anyone to question the political statements made by victims because they are victims. Ann does a good job explaining that being a victim does not automatically instill knowledge of international politics, or knowledge of Islam, or of much else, yet she sees (as we all do) the media fail to question a victim's political statements because they are victims, regardless of the merits of the arguments themselves.  Thus, as Ann points out, liberals trot out victims to make anti-Bush statements, or anti-American statements, and assume that the "victim" has an inherent (and they believe earned) "shield" from questions and analysis, dare we offend the victims or seem heartless. Unfortunately, not all the statements made by victims translate into well reasoned arguments, which was the point Ann was trying to make, and she made it clearly to everyone who grasped it, except for those who got stunned by the comments and stopped listening or reading (aka Liberals).  
 We were forced to read this book in philosophy class some years back and everyone was appauled by her hatred of men and  inability of see the beauty and wonder of intercourse.Her view of women isn't much better in that they are supposedly the poor helpless vessels men prey upon to oh my have such a  distasteful act as intercourse.The male in her book is the  aggressor and the female is the passive unwilling but willing  victim to only get children and love in return.If she can't see the pleasure of the sex act then it's no one's fault but hers. Every page of the book was hard to read.I don't know why some people bother to read such books because it's a waste of  trees,paper and time! Another problem is she makes it sound as though women who  like intercourse aren't up to her intellectual level,as though she has some perfect world where women hate men and intercourse. She tries to make very subjective material sound like it's  supposed to be the objective norm for every woman.Not!!! Very dangerous book 
 This book is appalling. It is disempowering to women, providing false and very negative information about out of hospital births (with no reference to back it up), and generally gives a "don't worry your pretty little head and do what the doctor tells you" attitude--even if what the doctor tells you will endanger you and your baby.   In spite of what this book says, there are things you can do to minimize tearing (and episiotomies don't heal better than tears, in spite of what the book says), things you can do to improve your chances of a healthy baby without a cesarean or other medical interventions, and so on. Of course there are times these things are needed, but not nearly so often as the book suggests, and it's not nearly so random. It continually cites opinions as facts, without any evidence base.  There are much, much better books out there than this one. Don't subject yourself to the needless anxiety of this book 
 Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist .The author is a anthropologist in real life and I feel she gave to much detail as to body parts & conditions ,& locations in the book , and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about "Gabby " including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of Gabbys place & How Gabby and Tempe were friends from GRad to man parts in life . Book was not for me I dropped it at the 3rd chapter . 
 Schaeffer's work, Escape From Reason, leaves much to be desired in the way of 'penetrating' thought. Quite honestly, he doesn't leave room for thought of any kind.  This book reads like the Christian version of "Final Exit," reeking of the nihilistic determinism of death, though in the first half of the book, he blames everybody and everything for the "theological shift," he claims, that has occurred. Countless times, (I gave up trying to count them all), he parlays that knowledge is by revelation ONLY, that reason is the cause for all of man's problems and difficulties; a conclusion which is patently false, because as the Bible states, sin is the cause of all of man's problems.  He engages in a fallacial logical argument, where he negates at predicate twice to call it identity. For instance, instead of A is A as identity... He says that A is NOT Non-A. The statement A-> ~(~A) is false when using quantitative reasoning, something to which Schaeffer objects.  As a Christian, I was outright offended by the statement he makes, that unless you have the content of the meaning of the name of Christ that the people of the Reformation had, then Christ's name is meaningless, or so says Schaeffer. I also found that many questions I had while reading this were not answered, and some altogether avoided:   If knowledge (wisdom, intelligence) is only gained by revelation, and only the select few are entitled to that revelation, should the rest of us remain ignorant? Schaeffer would say yes.   If reason is so bad for man, why is anti-reason not the answer either?   He goes through the line, Nature is bad, the principle of mechanics is bad, humanism is bad, freedom is bad, which would lead to the conclusion that intelligence is bad.   He asks the question, "How can unity exist when differences in thinking exist," to which I initially and facetiously replied "Marriage."  In his analysis of the Renaissance, he faults Thomas Aquinas for what he believes is the introduction of "humanism" into the doctrines of the church. Then he faults Leonardo da Vinci for Neo-platonist tendencies in Leo's works. "Curse those inventions of Leo's mind," Schaeffer seems to say. The list could go on and on, but it occurs to me that the only theophilologer to which Schaeffer completely defends is Immanuel Kant, whose whole premise was that reason should be completely abandoned for man to survive, and then so what if he doesn't.   So what Schaeffer really believes is that we should abdicate our minds, that things like this review have to be knowledge anomalies; that Christians are designed to be dumb and solfidious, (Justification by Faith Alone). Even when he clings to the existentialism of Karl Barth, Jean-Paul Sartre, (and Camus), he is forced to admit that his theory needs help from humanism, or else mankind has no redeeming value to himself or to God, (determinism, or in Christian circles, nihilistic pre-destination). It reminded me of the song, "Gloom, Despair, and Agony on Me."  Perhaps he should have read James 2:18, "I have faith and you have works; show me your faith, and I will show you my faith by my works."  Unfortunately for Schaeffer, works would require that man know how to do things, a concept called intelligence and learning.   This is ultimately a terrible book, offering no new thoughts or solutions, (how could he? the solutions have to be THOUGHT out.) to the continuing predicament in Christianity 
 I have several issues with the Pearls theologically, and this book is more of that bad theology.  Yes, there are nuggets of truth in this book (need to show respect toward your husband, be joyful), but you have to wade through a ton of bad stuff to get to the few nuggets of good.  Here is the book in a nutshell: (1) Everything that is wrong with your marriage (abuse, infidelity, porn addition, substance abuse) is YOUR fault (2) All you need to do is smile, wink and give your spouse regular rolls in the sack (3) Once you know your "place" you will be fine (4) Welcome back the spouse who sexually abuses your children (5) Be prepared to "[allow] some abuse" according to Michael Pearl (p. 263) in order to keep the chain of authority intact.  This book is full of contradictions and at times draws wild conclusions without offering one iota of scientific evidence.  The acknowledgement page states that Michael Pearl "rewrote [Debi's] half-hearted second tries" -- meaning that women are receiving marriage advice from a man, rather than from a Titus 2 woman.  Better and healthier books to read include Families Where Grace is in Place by Jeff VanVonderen and the upcoming Grace Based Living by Pastor Crystal Lutton. 
 I was so eager to read this book. But I was so disappointed when I finally did read it. I couuldnt even make it to the end of it. its so boring. and she keeps jumping from a story to another without knowing what is the real point of telling that story. its like you'are sitting with some talkative chatterbox who keeps on talking and talking till you lose it..  
 The Rise of the Network Society was on my reading list for school -- and I was looking forward to reading it, not only in the context of my class, but because the subject is an important one, especially regarding the  distribution of information and knowledge in our society.  Unfortunately, I  was soon disappointed to find that Castells, with all his remarkable  insight into the arts of communication, has not been able to go beyond the  oh-so cumbersome turns of phrase typical of academic writing. I find myself  turned off by the lingo, where I am truly interested in the subject; I  resent having to plow my way through his phraseology, while I certainly do  appreciate the research and energy he has invested in his work.  There  seems to be an ideal to academic writing that somewhat opposes the general  trend of having knowledge and information made accessible to everyone. Or  is it that Castells really means to restrict his writing (and being read)  to the groves of Academe? If proving himself versed in the field is more  important than getting the information out there, what does he have to  teach us about the implications of a network society? That we should better  cling to our own in-group, to only those who speak our language, whatever  that is? If that is so, what change can we expect from being related  through networks?  If Castells intends to put into practice his belief that  *observing, analyzing, and theorizing is a way of helping to build a  different, better world* (p. 4), then he might as well start with  generously offering his insights to the world he wants to see changed 
 This contains all of her "pop" hits from the nineties.  And I hate them! 
 I'm sure once you wade through all of his unsupported statistics, you'll find some useful advice from Mr. Lawhon, but I'm completely turned off by his assertions of 75% of this and 25% of that, for which he has no documentation.  If only I still owned the book (I was reimbursed for it by my employer), I would go back through it with a pen and redline all the useless crap.  After reading Book One, I feel discouraged, which is perhaps what the author wanted--to discourage anyone who wasn't wholeheartedly committed to selling.  (I started to write "110% committed," but then I would be guilty of misusing percentages in much the same manner as Mr. Lawhon. 
 I'm rather upset with the technical quality of this DVD.  Grindhouse rereleased this disc exactly as it was in 2000, without so much as a 16x9 animorphic upgrade.  This is certainly not worth the $20+ dollar price tag Amazon.com has right now 
 You may find this to your liking, but I wish I hadn't wasted my money. I tried for a couple of hours to get into this, but I simply could not read it.   Not that it's hard to understand. Quite the contrary. But I found it precious, affected, and silly.  Not to mention self-indulgent. Other than that, though . . .  Sartwell defines beauty as "the object of longing." He tells us he is "less concerned to defend that as a definition than to use it as a basis for trying to find something common to certain kinds of human experiences and relations to things." Since we long for many things that are not beautiful, and commonalities between experiences and objects of longing may therefore have little to do with beauty, I find this approach less than promising.   And indeed, Sartwell stretches the idea of beauty beyond any normal meaning, and he makes it useless as a category of discernment. For instance, Picasso's Guernica is not-and is not supposed to be-beautiful. It's a horror, and in its horror lies its grandeur-it's supposed to horrify us. To call it beautiful because it illustrates the satisfaction of the longing for power is to corrupt the term "beauty" and miss the point of the artwork.  As for the self-indulgence, Sartwell has merely collected snippets of his reflections. He says this is "a book of moments, and can be dipped into rather than read straight through, though I also hope that the accumulation of moments displays a kind of structure that could yield a coherent set of experiences." Well, if you invite someone to dip into your moments, you'd better be a genius, if they are to find such visits worthwhile. Sartwell isn't. One wonders whether he didn't bother to use his many moments to generate a coherent set of thoughts because that task was beyond him, or because he just couldn't be bothered. Either way, Sartwell's belief that his fragments of reflection are worth our while betrays a self-confidence that the twenty-five pages or so I pondered do not justify.  And frankly, you have to puzzle over the perceptiveness of anyone anyone who refers to "the beauty of Jennifer Lopez" as "the skinniest common denominator of nubile beauty."  
  As with most other kids I thought this book was not worth writing. While reading the description it sounded fantasticly exciting. In the beginning it actually sounded like an interesting piece of history. By the end it was one of the most boring books I've ever read. Now I have come to realize that just because a book wins the Newbery Medal does not mean that it is a good book. With 1,000 good books one book can be published because it is pollitically correct or is spewed out by a good author. I have no doubts about Elizabeth Yates but I think that Amos Fortune is a book about a man that had a good life, but one that was not nessicarily worth writing about 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 How anyone could rate this movie 4-5 stars is beyond belief. This was such a contrived movie that had a simple plot that went nowhere. As I watched this movie I could not figure out if it was meant to be a comedy or a drama. It was never very funny and both lead actors, playing one white and one adopted black brother, had scenes in the movie that were terrible. Romany Malco has a scene where he is running around in his underwear for no apparent reason accept to show off his body. He jumps out of bed when his cell phone rings, runs down the stairs and then outside and back in just to gather everyone in the house and scold them, in his drawers? He is talentless and idiotic as a "brother" in France that no one can relate to. Paul Rudd is likable but his shining scene is when he comes back to the chateau drunk and "grossly" tells off everyone - people he has known for less than a week! The servants are the best actors in the movie and play their parts well...but can't make up for the dismal rest. Ludicrous - a bad movie that probably could have been funny if they had went for laughs instead of drama. This is another example of a rental that you think is going to be good but then disappoints 
 I found this book a disappointment because the author allowed his personal issues and problems (e.g. family problems, illness, drug use) to interfere with the picture he was trying to paint. Henry Beston's THE OUTERMOST HOUSE, A YEAR OF LIFE ON THE GREAT BEACH OF CAPE COD, is much more to my liking, because of the beautiful prose and the full concentration of Mr. Beston on the topic at hand (i.e. the Cape, its history, its beauty, its wildness).  I find it incongruous for this author, David Gessner, to make the effort to get in touch with nature by living out in the wilds by the ocean, and then to take the unnatural step of using drugs while doing so.  It offends my senses almost as much as do the actions of people who play boomboxes at the beach while supposedly enjoying nature.  I guess I like my nature natural and without the distractions of these other modern day intrusions.  And I like my information and insights gleaned from my readings to be based on reality not drug induced fantasy.  These personal issues (which in another context, might have been appropriately raised and interesting) seemed only to be undesired distractions in this context 
 Hugely disappointed with the over-design of this book, and consider it a magnificent book criminally ruined by overly decorative backdrops to the pages of original EC stories.  The biographies and text here by Geissman is simply terrific; providing a cogent, articulate, evocative context for these iconic 1950s artists - from Wally Wood, Joe Orlando, Graham "Ghastly" Ingels, to the incredibly talented cover-art genius of Johnny Craig - not to mention the epochal Krigstein and the whole range of science fiction art in this justly remembered EC period.  BUT... the clutter of coloured backgrounds placed behind the reproduced pages of stories by these artists made me want to immediately consign this book to an Ingels watery grave in the bayou!  It is a travesty.  Unbelievably congested, busy, "wriggling amoebae" multi-coloured backgrounds to the reproduced 1950s art visually compete with it throughout.  It provides the WORST "visual noise" that totally distracts and competes with the well-reproduced art; the backgrounds COMPETE for attention like trying to read a comic-book in a vast tub of spaghetti, or enlarged coloured slides of dissected innards under a microscope.  It becomes visually unbearable, and TOTALLY UNDERMINES the EC art.  It is one of the very worst examples of appallingly over-designed books I can think of, where some faddish photo-shop graphics moron has been allowed to run their rampantly stupid techno-boots ALL OVER the crisp, stark integrity of the original artists.  Wally Wood will be rolling in his grave.  Geissman should be shot for having this desecrating, congested muddle of coloured vomit over-design and compromise the VISUAL CLARITY of these great artists.  A TRULY APPALLING DESIGN/BOOK LAYOUT DECISION.  ALL THE EDITORS ON THIS PROJECT SHOULD ALSO BE LINED UP FOR THESE TECHNI-COLOUR CRIMES AND GIVEN A BLOODY HIDING.  A great book by Grant Geissman that has become a grievous, unredeemable INSULT to the original 1950s artists it is supposed to be honouring.     
 I started this book because I love the quote about writing being but a different word for conversation.  Yes, there are moments of great wit.  However, they are lost within a mass of verbiage so dense that it makes your mortgage agreement look like a Little Golden Book.  It's not the sublime non-linearity of Joyce's writing or Ornette Coleman's playing.  It's the amplification of the self to an unbearable degree.  Certainly a unique achievement, I guess.  But so is Lou Reed's "Metal Machine Music.&quot 
 It's a good album to listen to while cleaning your apartment. Save your money. Assuming your time is valuable don't bother listening to it. It would be a complete and total waste of time. Sarah proves again that she has some powerful pipes but so what? At least "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy" has "Possession" and a couple of other songs which have hooks. You get the picture that Sarah was under pressure from the record company and just cranked out some songs with no hit potential and nothing really for the concentrating listener 
 This is just a way for Urban Dictionary to milk what their site stands for.  If you want to keep up with slang, an offline dictionary is not the way to go.  New slang is created and added every day on urbandictionary.com; most of it varies in importance, origin, use and documentation.  All together, this is not an appropriate dictionary.  Don't waste your money 
 We had a really cheap monitor before we bought this one because it was just so noisy.. so we bought this one thinking it was going to be quieter.  Well, it is ALOT quieter than our monitor, but like others said, it makes this awful beeping noise!  It has gone off twice in the middle of the night before!  We also have another digital phone, so it is constantly switching channels as well trying to find an available channel.  I would look elsewhere for another monitor.. The beeping is what gets to me - I dont like being woke up by a very loud beep in the middle of the night!  
 I've enjoyed several other Aczel works: Fermat's Last Theorem, God's Equation, Mystery of the Aleph, and I struggled mightily to get through this one, but it's just too dull. Blah, blah, blah, then this clown wrote to that one and said meaningless things; blah, blah, blah, these phrases from this ancient manuscript appeared in this person's letters, proving he was influenced by it. Blech 
 This is the required text for my course. I've read it thoroughly and it seems great, but it definitely is not getting me the grade I want.  I'm buying a different textbook to supplement 
 The reason many of us fail to succeed is that we buy into common sense.  This book does just that by reinforcing bad practices.  It suggests that one should save and invest wisely.  There is little way in which a person could achieve significant wealth by this method though perhaps a good retirement.  The most successful people do not follow this method.  I am pretty well off myself and I can say I did not follow this method and had I, I would not be doing so well.  Unfortunately there is not a solid path to wealth (not that I know of).  Compare the wealth of Richard Branson versus Donald Trump - two very different approaches without few similarities.  My mother followed this approach and ended with just a small savings.  The story sounds appealing until you realize that it is fiction - there was no such man and that should speak for itself.  
 I want to love this book (I love the title) But - it's about the goofiest thing I've ever read. I read a lot and I realize that I may be considered not "deep" enough to understand what she is saying, but almost every sentence seems to consist of a lot "I am you, you are me, we are invisible, we are nothing, we are everything so we are nothing." Perhaps it would be better if I were familiar with her earlier works and I will probably read them because so many people LOVE this book. But it almost feels like a sham, like the Emperor has no clothes. So on the whole, I admit that I don't get about half of what she's saying - I think a little more background or examples might help. I dunno. I'm not sure if I had a stroke in the desert that I would be comforted by her simply staring at me "in love". (from one of the chapters). I wish I could love it, but I don't - still reading it though 
 I bought this CD after thoroughly liking Moon Safari and Talkie Walkie. This CD would probably make a really good soundtrack as background music for the movie, but it wasn't a good CD. Most of the songs are boring and repetitive, with just different variations on the same theme 
 Hilts is a journalist so perhaps he can be forgiven for writing such a biased book, although to give him credit, he does not seem to even try to hide his bias, which makes the book a kind of comedy. A much better (and thinner) book on the FDA is written by a former FDA regulator and a M.D., To America's Health, by Henery Miller 
 I was really disappointed with this book.  The two characters are not aware of each other until almost the end of the book.  Then the lead male character professes love for her without even really knowing her.  This will go into my resell pile 
 It seems to be a thinly veiled attempt to capitalize on the success of the Da Vinci Code. And just in case you missed it, there are several references too! The plot is wafer thin....who on earth would expend money and effort to simply chase a 4000-year old dream? All situations seemed to be too easily contrived and coincidental. Traps built several thousand years ago continue to work with the efficiency of a Swiss watch. Reilly thinks he's writing to a bunch of school kids.....exclamations, sound effects and hyphenated actions abound! Too obviously, the protagonists (Lily and West) have genius-level IQs and crack codes like you and I would crack our knuckles. The heroes have unfettered access to almost everything. Save yourself money and time .... stay away from this book 
 I was very much looking forward to this release. As big fan starting back with "Tea for the Tillerman" loving all of the 1st 4 albums, having really enjoyed "A is for Allah", and even the little clips I heard of this new album sounded good. But,"An Other Cup" is unlistenable.  Lacking the simple pure devotional, genuine presence of "A is for Allah" and without the clever lyrics and heartfelt angst of Cat's early work.  His voice is good, surprising solid, but these lyrics are so awful, so droll, boring, I will not be listening to this album for a long time, not until i forget how much of a waste it is 
 I was MISLEAD by the title of this listing, since there is no picture I thought it was an actual textbook, only softcover.  When it arrived it turns out to be a study guide to the textbook!?  I am a struggling college student and I lost $45 shipped on this one.  (you dont need the study guide unless you have money to burn and and dont know how to take notes in class;p) I had to buy the hardcover textbook of course, another hefty $120 at the time...good going amazon, next time put a picture, or dont offer it for sale 
 I saw Jon Stewart interview Kristol last night on the daily show.  As best I can remember, Jon said:   "Bill, you people were way ahead of the curve!  This book proves that you were wrong about Iraq _way_ before everyone else was wrong about Iraq!"  That sums it up pretty nicely.  I think history will show that Kristol & Co were also wrong about Bush being a conservative (as that word is currently understood) but it'll take a few more years to be sure.

 Jim Leher's novel was a great disappointment to me.  An individual so accomplished, articulate and engaging left all that behind when he sat down to write this novel.  The story line could have been interesting but I was greatly distracted by the simplistic character development and somewhat implausable series of events.  If Lehrer chooses to pursue this avocation I urge he seek ways to enliven his characters and develop a more pictureque manner of writing.  Frankly, this novel was less gripping than a poorly cast and directed high school drama.  
 These recipes often call for ingrediates I've never heard of and have no idea where I would find them.  Contrary to the borring cover the inside design is very pleasing but it becomes frusterating to not be able to make half the recipes 
 AN AIR FORCE PILOT [ICE-T] FAKES HIS OWN DEATH ONLY TO RESURFACE AS THE PARTNER OF A DEADLY LATIN AMERICAN ARMS DEALER [ANDREW DIVOFF]. WHEN A STEALTH GETS STOLEN AND IT'S USED TO TARGET THE MILITARY, IT'S UP TO ONE MAN [COSTAS MANDYLOR] TO STOP HIM BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. ONE THING THAT CAN'T BE DENIED IS THAT THIS MOVIE IS BORING. THE ACTION IS NOT WORTH WATCHING, THE SCRIPT IS DUMB, AND THE STORY JUST GETS TIRING AFTER A WHILE. ERNIE HUDSON'S ACTING TALENTS ARE ONCE AGAIN WASTED IN ANOTHER LOW-RENT DIRECT-TO-VIDEO FILM. IF YOU LIKE ICE-T AND WANNA SEE ONE OF HIS MORE RECENT FILMS, SAVE YOUR MONEY AND RENT OR BUY ''OUT KOLD''. 
 This is a case where the book is wonderful and the movie is just pathetic.  I hadn't read the book before seeing the movie.  The film stunk.  A few years later, I read the book and was enchanted.  I did not make the connection that this was the same story until I saw the film again on late night tv.  I was all excited to see one of my favorite books on the screen.  Then, I realized what movie it was.  I tried to sit through it.  I just couldn't.  The monster should have eaten the film 
 This volume would have carried a lot more weight if the proofreaders had done their jobs correctly. The many typos detracted from the sometimes useful text. The TV show Bewitched became Bewitch and near the end of the book a page just ended in the middle of a sentence. The next page started a new sentence and thought. Overall I liked what he had to say but I couldn't get past the errors. It just lost its authority with all the sloppiness. 
 Was a bit let down and even angry at times while tryng to assemble and play the game with our 8 year old.  This game is not user friendly and vague at times as far as direction goes.   We enjoyed the game in spite of it...do to our own shear determination to do so.   Very leary to recommend. 
 Although the book has some good tips I had trouble getting started and once I did well lets put it this way i did not stick with it for long. The only reason I am keeping the book is because it list alot of foods and how much protein, carb, fat information is in them. They hype the book up and I fell in hook line and sinker. I guess that old saying applies right about know " If it sounds to good to be true Etc...." 40 carb 30 protien 30 fat dont cut it. But I did figure out how to loose weight and keep it off; Its simple I got off my lazy butt started to excersise ate better and walla 10lbs lighter and working for more AND HERES THE CATCH ITS FREE walking 30min and common sense tells you wich foods in your fridge are good and bad for you 
 This is a very informative book and I will probably use it as a strong reference in years to come.  It is not, however, a very easily read textbook.  Some areas are repetative and make for very slow reading.  Many times the author backs up her explanations citing studies. This is excellent in a reference book, however, as an introduction to an area of OT, it makes learning the subject matter laborious 
 Much of the book has little to actually do with building a robot. Or even interfacing a controller into a system. Much of the book takes you through using a LCD. Little is done with inputs from sensors or controlling motors. Although it is a good tool to learn C for the PIC. It's not the best for using with robotics. 
 I tried to make some snack on this book and follow the instruction, but turn out not what I expected and not look like the result on the picture 
 Joanna Weaver, the author of "Having a Mary Spirit", also wrote "Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World."  She has a unique way of reaching out to women with total clarity.  She reveals her own struggles and we all can identify with what she has experienced. There is also a touch of humor throughout.        We all want to improve our lives, to grow closer to God.  This book is a great little manual for doing so.  I highly recommend it, as it will surely change your life.   
 This CD while full of nice music, is to me rather pointless.  It's listed as a sound track but all it has is background music instrumentals.  Does anyone know the titles of the actual songs used in the movie?  Aside from Crazy train 
 Freedom of speech.  Ya gotta love it.  It gives any two bit hack the right to get up on a podium and spout his pop psychology to draw in however many supporters he can muster, a God unto himself, without peer review.  And in this case, the pride of this power has led the author into a descent into true evil.  It may help some to hear the perspective of a lifelong atheist.  I was never indoctrinated into a religion.  This does not mean I was not exposed to other misguided notions, but I suspect this is an important area to be spared because nowhere else is one expected to and practically required to accept and wholeheartedly swallow broadly unsubstantiated material.  I found Peck's arguments to be well thought-out up to a point, which as other reviewers have noted is about halfway through the book.  He argues quite convincingly that people who desire mental health must be dedicated to the truth, and that means not accepting religious dogma.  Further, I agree completely with him that people should not settle for hand-me-down religions but should pursue a personal path to spiritual growth.  Recognizing that the subconscious is the largely hidden reserve of wisdom and the seat of what religions take for God, I expected him to proceed down the objective course he had set out.  I'm sure you will not be surprised that I was very dismayed to hear that did not free him from unsubstantiated dogma after all.    Before going further into the book, let me point out that I am a tolerant but "hard core" atheist.  An atheist forms his ideas from his observations, not from his imagination.  Since gods are suppositions without evidence, they have no place in rational thinking about the world as we know it.  Note that an atheist doesn't "believe" that there is no god; an atheist doesn't exactly "believe" anything.  "Certain" knowledge includes only that which is defined to be true or follows from such definitions, e.g. mathematics.  Everthing else is based on scientfic hypotheses, which are neither true nor false but apply with a certain degree of accuracy to the known world.  Note that the term agnostic, meant to mean an atheist who holds that it can't be be known whether gods exist or not, is rather pointless, as nothing about the real world can be known to be true or false - everything, as I mentioned, is merely hypothetical.  Now we get to the hard core part.  Many atheists are unconcerned with what beliefs religious people occupy themselves with.  I, on the other hand, agree with Peck that religion is a psychopathology and should be treated.  (It is rather blatantly ironic and pitiful on the face of it that after proving this rather eloquently Peck reveals that he himself has been swept up by religious delusions).  The belief in dogmatic phenomena like gods and further, the belief that said belief must be held without question as a point of faith, is potentially quite a dangerous state of mind that can lead to harmful life decisions.  While we can't prove the truth of scientific hypotheses, we can disprove them.  It is an historical fact both of the literature and from every experience of our daily lives that there is no known example of a supernatural phenomena, i.e. one that has disproven natural laws.  It is only at the point where a reason arises to doubt our understanding of the natural world that the reason arises to suppose supernatural causes.  I am a tolerant atheist in that, while I believe religion should be treated, I recognize that no effective treatment exists and so I reluctantly tolerate it even among my closest associates.  This is because I recognize that religion is an attempt, albeit usually based on flighty principles, to get in touch with our true, deeper selves, our "spiritual" side, the vast unconscious swath of human existence that science has not yet touched on but still remains the greater part of our real existence, since our brains are the only reality we really know; our knowledge of the world around us is second hand through our brains.  Without going into great detail, let me just say that Peck descends into a morass of dogmatic views about God, propped up by such bizarre items as unlikely coincidences and how evolution goes against entropy.  Serendipity is a chance happening and not proof of God's existence.  That said, if belief in an unseen helper is the only way you can maintain a positive attitude toward life, then it is a psychopathology that may prove more helpful than harmful.  Still, you would better off seeing the world for what it is and still keeping the positive attitude.  It is true, though, that science and objectivity themselves have not offered up any reason for people to maintain a positive attitude; in fact on the surface it does just the opposite.  For atheists to compete with religions for adherents we must come up with a better way of explaining to people why one can be more exuberant getting closer to the truth than one can to imaginary friends.  Peck's explanation of entropy provides a good example of what kind of bad life decisions a belief in unsubstantiated dogma can lead to.  Apparently a preexisting belief in God (which I hesitate to point out is a term which none of the religions can or could define, which leaves it meaningless) led Peck to misunderstand entropy as something that must increase locally as well as globally, leading him to the conclusion that evolution goes against nature.  It can be easily demonstrated by any first year chemistry student that the injection of energy into a system can do a lot to decrease entropy locally.  This demonstrates that Peck's religious delusions compromised his whole understanding of science.  Having an unsound worldview while you are being educated is dangerous because it can lead to your missing large chunks of your education, leading you to go on to publish falsehoods and spread your misinformation to a wide audience.  I had to award some negative stars for this lack of responsibility.  His analysis of "evil" may make a preacher proud, but from a scientific standpoint it is not only wildly speculative but just plain wrong for a psychoanalyst to adopt.  Evil implies full conscious volition, and the truth, as he is more or less willing to admit, is that evil people have gone down a path where they have surrendered adequate conscious controls, so it is really just pathetic that he uses the word at all.  Sadly, I can't report that Peck came to his senses; he descended deeper into this untenable topic of evil in his book "People of the Lie".  Groan.  The truth is, as any kindergartner knows, that evil is not a kind of laziness as Peck affirms, but willful misdirection through sophistry.  He doesn't just do it with the definition of evil, he does it whenever he redefines a common term.  Love is *not* as love does, as he states.  "Falling in love" is not a biological trap, with true love being the follow through of actions that comes later.  This misdirection, while useful as a platform for sermonizing about commitment and discipline, is patently untrue as anyone who has ever felt feelings of love knows.  The feeling of love is often and even usually not accompanied by appropriate follow through.  Sure, those who wish to be happy and mentally healthy should follow through, but often people in love hurt each other through neglect or even direct abuse.  The actual love is always the "in love" sensation which Peck wishes to misdirect us away from.  Without that, no amount of follow through will do any good.  Is "falling in love" a biological trick?  Dr. Peck, I would hope you would have the grace to recognize it for the ultimate gift of nature that it is and not disparage it.  Satan himself could not have drawn us off the mark more skillfully.  Doctor, heal thyself.  I must say, if ever a person showed the promise, the capacity and the inclination to get past a misguided worldview, this is the person.  Sadly, I say this tongue-in-cheek.  It is well known that those in the grip of religious pathology can rarely break free, even if they can talk about it.  I liken it to an extreme Stockholm Syndrome effect.  If you take a child hostage, what chance does he have?    Adopting a "personal" religion won't serve you better than a second-hand religion so long as it is based on unsupported suppostions as well.  Those who would really take Peck's advice to heart will truly dispense with all religious notions they have heard from others and base their worldview on what they themselves have observed.  My parents were kind enough to leave me to my own devices and it has worked very well for me.  "Grace" is not coming to an accommodation with "God", it is coming to an accommodation with yourself.  It is the sense of peace and enlightenment that washes over you as you get in touch with your larger subconscious mind in various ways.  If you want a book that puts this beautifully, practically and without overt religious overtones, read "Gift of the Sea" by Anne Morrow Lindbergh. 
 Could commendations of excellence from two U.S. Presidents be wrong?  Well, I just couldn't wade through the muck.  Heavy metaphor rotation and dewy-eyed spiritual platitudes are to be expected- after all, it's a self-help book- but the book could easily be 100 pages thinner without such reliance on them.  The writing style is condescending and overly soothing, with such gems as "Now let's take a look at how creating a clear commitment separates your voice from that of Jiminy Lizard", and "Wait a minute now, I'm not going to let these Yeahbuts shoot down my dream".  And I know they are hardly the point, but the illustrations are so bizarre they reminded me of religious tracts.  I still can't shake the drawing of the Eskimo, and found the comparison of an "Inuit (Eskimo)" building an igloo to my building a satisfying career not only decidedly un-PC (odd for the generation the book is probably meant to appeal to- I get a heavy Boomer vibe), but a stretch, too.  Preening quotes are sprinkled throughout the book, from Joseph Campbell, Ghandi, Kierkegaard, and Yoda.  Sub-sections of chapters, called "Inquiries", have titles such as "Designing Your Workplace Ecosystem" and "What Game Will I Play?".  But worst of all, the book consistently gave me the sense that the motherlode of critical information was just about to be revealed, but, wait, not yet; please read some more star-shine and cloud-glow first, and your dedication will be rewarded, we promise!  This book left me itchy and bored.  Filling a notebook with my innate talents and figuring out the difference between a mission and a purpose?... honestly, I didn't feel the love 
 Richard Haass attempts to distinguish himself from the neocons. Aside from form, however, the substance really isn't any different. Both begin with the assumption that American Imperium is a requirement for peace and prosperity and any real deviation means *global* catastrophe. Any suggestion that American Imperium itself is the problem is simply beyond the pale, and is dismissed by all sides of american foreign policy elite (neocons and neorealists) as "unserious" or worse. Neocons and neorealists are 2 sides of the same coin. The "argument" between them is kabuki theater. A pointless handwringing melodrama, signifying little and meaning even less. At their core, both are motivated by a proconsul's view of the world where the only future of humanity worth living is one where america's elite, and the children of america's elite, are the one's calling the shots.   It's not a view shared by the rest of the world 
 The Kite Runner gets off to such a good start, with its blend of history, observations about daily life in Kaboul, and a compelling story of two boys growing up together. The second half goes badly astray, as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental. By the end of the book, the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation. I wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up, stay focused, and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand 
 I am lawyer from Brazil, and wanted to get real information about the green card application process (without having to go through the dry explanation in the INS website) and was completely disapointed and upset when I received this book.  It does not cover anything in depth, and wastes a lot of time talking about temporary visas, fiance visas (I thougt it was supposed to explain about greencards!), special greencards for amerasians (which is not a very common situation)...     As for what I was really interested in, which was the green card application process for work-related reasons, there is a small, incomplete paragraph and a suggestion that I find an attorney!!!! Waste of money, useless -- if you want to get a green card, either find another book, check the INS website, or hire a lawyer, this book will not help at all.  
 If I could have given this book a "0", I would.  I have spent a considerable amount of time in Iran, as an American woman and as a mother accompanied by my children. I have never experienced anything but warmth, hospitality, and respect from any Iranians I encountered while living there.  Although, I was not married to an Iranian man, bad, abusive marriages happen anywhere. Why is a bad marriage in Iran--if this was indeed the case--considered so "newsworthy?" It is troubling that one woman's overly-dramatized, traumatic account is seen in the US as the prototype for all of Iranian culture.  For example, I have eaten in the homes of many Iranians, of all social classes, in cities and in villages, and never once did I encounter bugs in the food.  Doesn't anyone find it suspicious that the ghost writer, William Hoffer, also was the author of "Midnight Express"--a book about an American in a Turkish prison?  What is his agenda? What is Ms. Mahmoody's agenda? Why is this book so popular in the US?  Could it be that we want to read/see things that confirm our stereotypes of the Middle East and Islamic cultures as "evil."  The reader should try to disengage him/herself from Mahmoudy's traumatic story and try to read between the lines.  Think critically, for crying out loud, about how books such as these demonize another culture, so that we can have the opportunity to see another people as less than human, and thereby feel no remorse when they're under attack. This is one of the worst--and most damaging--pieces of propaganda I've ever seen. Shame on Sally Field for taking part in the film!  Even the cover is misleading: Iranian women do not cover their faces with their veils like this.  This is a custom found more in Saudi Arabia 
 I bought this book thinking that it would give me a good idea of what to do and where to go. After reading this book, I almost don't want to go to the big island! It's not only is hard to use, but almost every section I  read told about how you couldn't get to some place it was talking about or  that the place was to dangerous because of tide or locals. I suggest  looking for another guide 
 It will not work on this drive.   Period.  I switched to Maxell and Fujifilm disks, and now I'm a happy camper 
 In my standards of reading I think this book was not a page-turner even though it won a Michael L. Printz Award. I would not recommend this book to others. The reasons why I would not recommend this is that the problem isn't really that believable, because I really don't believe someone would be that crazy enough to get rid of their own son. In my point of view I thought the book was very morbid and morose. My experience reading this book I thought the plot moved too slowly. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate this book a 2.  
 This was not the life-changing book it was touted to be. I have no major complaints, but the book was not helpful 
 I looked forward to reading this book because it was presented to me as definitive in its field.  Much to my chagrin, what I read sounded as calm and reflective as something that might have been issued from the Union war office in 1863.  Cash has nothing good to say for the South, which is why this piece of cheap propaganda is a "classic."  After reading about two hundred pages, I looked at the paragraph or two about the author, which stated what I had already suspected.  Cash was a Southerner who wrote this book and then hanged himself.  If you want to experience page after chapter after page of a man with complete self-loathing, then I recommend The Mind of the South, a book in which we learn much about Mr. Cash's mind in Cloud-Cuckooland, though next to nothing about the real South.  That this book is often foisted on unsuspecting students fills me with loathing 
 Though the recipies in this book sound delicious this book is far from written for dummies as it claims. Being a beginning cook I find it hard to follow what would seem to be the basic instruction for each recipe. I get lost figuring out just how to cut an onion "coursely" as I've never done it before. There is even a figure missing from chapter 5 that is supposed to show a key ingredient for Braise Endive (what the heck is endive?) This book is obviously written for someone who has basic knowledge of cooking and its very frustrating to read. The instructions are too vague for beginners and the descriptions of techniques leave me wondering what the author is talking about. Not to mention each recipe expects that you have an entire kitchen full of gadgets at your disposal to prepare these fancy dishes. I think I'm going to have to find a different book to teach me to cook before I can dive into "Cooking for Dummies" and understand whats going on. Look for a different book! 
 I was not really impressed with this CD.  The previous 2 CDs(Mission to Please, Eternal) were so much better.  R Kelly is a great producer, but did not write the best songs for the Isleys for this.  2 Bad !!! :(  Isleys were better off with Jam and Lewis from the Eternal CD.  Listen and Buy at your own risk 
 The characters are all over the top dysfunctional.  The main character is boring and self destructive.  When the characters are not likeable who cares what has or will happen to them??  This book reads like a 1970's Movie of the Week starring Lindsay Wagner.  
 The reference to craft "superstars" should have warned me off. The lowly T-shirt shows up as a placemat, a lampshade, a car-lot hanging banner, café curtains, and a rug - oh yeah, and a couple of overworked wearables, too. Tricky projects show off the wit of their too-cool creators rather than enrich the lives of DIY readers.Who needs it? 
 I thought this book would provide information (it does, but very little) about the lazy scholarship and outright denial that many leftist, particularly, in academia have about communism.  The book ends up being a whole lot of name calling, and very little presenting of actual facts.    I recognize the schizophrenic love affair the left has with communism and am always looking for more and more (as if it was needed) facts to show how evil and devestating communism is.  Instead, this book belongs on the bookshelf next to Al Franken and Ann Coulter and more ideological shrieking.   Don't waste your time, this book is so much fluff.  I only gave this book two stars because, it rightly points out the state of denial someone must still be in to think communism is a good government system 
 ....for several reasons.  Apparently, the other online reviewers are extremely over-analytical in their critiques of this film.  The DVD's jacket has a quote from Rolling Stone..."Think 'Sex and the City' with men!"  Well, I say, "Think again."   As an avid watcher of "Sex and the City", this film has little if any comparison to SATC.  Firstly, this film is not a comedy.  There were very small instances when I kind of chuckled, but could barely muster a real laugh.  Actually, towards the end of the film there is so much constant screaming and fighting that I kept hitting FAST FORWARD on the remote (those of you who regularly depend on reviews for movie choices know exactly what I mean here!).  The characters are presented in a confusing fashion with only snippets and glimpses into each person's life.  These disjointed glimpses don't give the viewer time or depth to care what happens to any of the spoiled rotten characters.  Yes, they are all bored whether they are in their 30's or their 50's.  Yes, they all want to break away from the mundane by running away or having affairs.  I usually enjoy movies with this breaking-away-from-boredom type of plot for example...Pane e Tulipani (Bread and Tulips), Facing Windows (also starring Giovanna Mezzogiorno and a MUCH better film), Under the Tuscan Sun, Shirley Valentine, A Month by the Lake, etc. The Last Kiss does not deliver anything near what these other films do, however.  The viewer is left with no warm feelings about life's decisions, only a twist ending that will make you furious and sick for having spent two hours watching this film 
 it's surprising that so many people gave this book a favorable rating - did we read the same book? i found "purple hibiscus" a little to simplistic and childish for any accolades - there was no particular insight on any of the issues e.g. physical abuse, first love, teenage angst/rebellion - to speak of, and the political ranting towards the end is laughable. apparently, everyone that can write a few words is now styling themselves as political activists, i wonder where ms. adichie was during those tumultous times - enjoying the breeze well away from the conflict in london - and now she's spewing out all the stuff she probably heard from her parents. i doubt that any self-respecting nigerian - unless you're the type that thinks "mills and boons" are literary masterpieces - will find anything remarkable about this book. as for people who don't know anything about nigeria, or africa, i suggest you read chinua achebe, buchi emecheta, or wole soyinka (for the cerebral) to get a real flavor 
 I ordered this book through a bookclub and returned it.  It was terrible!  Tanya Holland is a beautiful Black woman, but I feel has gone too far out of the way to create "innovative and different" recipes so much that they are not appealing and certainly should not be categorized as soul food.  The price is outrageous for the handful of recipes that were chosen for this cookbook.  I collect african american/soul food cookbooks among others.  If you are really into soul food cookbooks and what they really represent, your money would be better spent on "Essence Brings you Great Cooking" by Jonell Nash, "The Ebony Cookbook" by Freida DeKnight or "The Black Family Reunion Cookbook" by the The National Council of Negro Women.  If you are interested in healthier soul food try, "The New Ebony Cookbook" by Charlotte Lyons or "The Family Dinner Quilt Cookbook" by The National Council of Negro Women.  If you are interested in diverse, cultural flavors, I would recommend Vertamae Grosvenor's cookbooks or "Iron Pots and Wooden Spoons" by Jessica B. Harris.  I have collected over 50 african american soul food cookbooks.  They cover the gamut.  That is why I can give an honest opinion on Tanya Holland's book.  I just wish that she would publish an african american cookbook that the average African American can relate to.  One that would be useful to families in their everyday cooking.  
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 Last month our bookclub discuss this book, and it was very boring.It most was about other sports not  baskekball which was the story. Bruce Brooks write a book that is  exciting . 
 This thing doesn't hold a charge for very long and anything with weight gets left behind. They need to do more work on this idea 
 Rabbit Proof Fence was a slow going book; you had to really have the will to continue reading. The first 50 pages consisted of Doris Pilkington describing the history of Western Australia in the late 1800's/early 1900's. It was slightly confusing since she skipped between different tribes and places, all of which are in a completely different language- sometimes full sentences would be in an aboriginal dialect. She then followed a couple of young girls. It finally started to get interesting and worthwhile. But then, instead of the book reaching the climax and enthralling you, it loses it. I got completely bored for the last 75 pages; it seemed as though it was the same thing happening over and over. The ending also seemed quite rushed, as though she had to fit it in a certain number of pages. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you are obsessed with Australian history or know how to read many confusing aboriginal languages. 
 This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.  Symbiopsychotaxiplasm is an independent mockumentary by William Greaves  filmed mostly in Central Park in New York City.  It is about a film crew working on scenes for a film. I did not find it to be very interesting and much of it was repetitive. It also had a large amount of profanity also.  The set also has a second disk with a sequel to the film. "Symbiopsychotaxiplasm Take 2 1/2"  The special features on disc one are a theatrical trailer and and a documentary "Discovering William Greaves"  Disc two contains the sequel and an interview with Steve Buscem 
 WE THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT UNTIL WE STARTED NOTICING WHITE DUST ON EVERYTHING.  WE CHANGED THE FILTER, BUT THAT DIDN'T HELP, AND WE'VE BEEN USING SOFT DISTILLED WATER.  WE'VE GOT TO GET A DIFFERENT ONE!  I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS HUMIDIFIER UNLESS YOU WANT TO DUST OFF WHITE DUST OFF EVERYTHING EVERYDAY - NO FUN 
 Possibly the worst book I have ever read.  The "style" could be bested by a not-too-bright fifth grader.  The plot is an imbecilic rehash of the Divinci Code.  Don't bother keeping track of any details, because everything turns out to be irrelevant.  If you want to entertain yourself and your friends, however, check this out of your local library and get mildly drunk.  Now open the book at random and read aloud.  This should cause hysterical I-can't-believe-this-got-published laughter.  
 I am shocked at the number of readers who have given this such high marks. This is really a piece of ****. That plot is paper-thin, the characters are shallow, stereotypical losers, and the book if full of that isn't-writing-a-gay-novel-such-a-lark attitude.  I mean, I don't expect everything to be great literature and I enjoy fluff as much as the next person, but the preliferation of this type of novel scares me.  By "this type" I mean bad imitations of already fluffy fiction. Anyone who has ever watched a bad sitcom and soap opera could write a book just like this.  Please notice:  I did not say that writing ability was required 
 Although the poems are beautiful... and I certainly don't mean to bash Whitman with this 2-star rating... it's the wrong book. NOT AS ADVERTISED. This was supposed to be the original 1855 edition. That's what I expected, and therefore (in my mind) what I was paying for. The original 1855 edition, according to modern literary analysis, was the "strongest/purest" version. It was the true starting point of Whitman's own (and consequently America's) poetic awakening. Consisting of just 12 "perfect" poems, it was THAT edition which Emerson praised so highly.  Whitman never put out another book... just revision after revision, addition after addition, and edition after edition of Leaves Of Grass... until you wind up with "the deathbed edition" which is a severely bloated and different work from the original.   I was very much looking forward to a slender volume of the original edition. Which is what the item description says this is. It's not. Be forewarned... it's the Deathbed Edition of 1892... nearly 500 pages. And frankly, there are MUCH better versions of the deathbed edition. Sturdier versions with nicer pages exist (this is a pretty weak paperback, printed on pulp pages), with better footnotes and more authoritive introductions. Shop around.   To sum up... the 2 star rating is because lying about which edition this is, is a terrible way to sell the book. Whitman was fantastic and the poetry contained in the book itself is first rate. It just would have been nice to get what I paid for. The "true" editon, written by a YOUNG Whitman at the height of his powers.. 
 This has a nicely varied assortment of projects, not just wearables, but it is nothing too fantastic-- car lot pennants? Placemats? They may be celebrities, but they arent doing any mind-blowing design.  Another problem with this book is that some of the projects require a wide-spread crafting knowledge (screenprinting and crochet) and the supplies for those things (screen and ink, squeegee, etc) which could get a little spendy.  the wearables are not that cute or inspired (applying rows of snaps, embroidering on the shoulder? children could have come up with this stuff.   check it out at the library first.  This wasnt at all what I was looking for, but it might inspire you.  It did have great photos 
 ...essentially you get what you pay for. This book is certanly NOT representative of what I have come to expect from National Geographic.   I had eagerly anticipated the arrival of my book, but was dissappointed to find within the first few pages that it is uninspiring at best. Most of the pictures are poorly executed and at times seem amateurish. In the past I've found photographs by professionals like Steve McCurry ('Portraits')visually arresting. Not so here.  At least it only cost me $20 oredering from Amazon. If I had been able to preview it beforehand, I would not have thought it worth even the discounted price 
 No thank you, I won't be having seconds. I already own the original Ebony cookbook so I picked this one up with high expectations. What a let down! The New Ebony cookbook is full of bland recipes that I will never try. Considering that the orignal book is a treasury of Americas finest Black cooking there is no excuse for this new version to be so poor. Stick with the original 
 This book is only masquerading as a textbook -- it is a propaganda tool for those who want to stick their heads in the sand and not talk honestly about contraception.  Check the index for yourself -- "birth control" and "contraception" are NOT EVEN LISTED.  The section on AIDS does NOT MENTION condom use.  It is appalling that in this day and age a textbook to be used in health class can leave out science, truth, and a well-rounded discussion of responsible use of contraceptives.  This book deserves far less than 1 star.  
 Prior to purchasing this item, I read a review that one should instead look towards a product that pulls up from the base of the foot and not the toe.  I wish I heeded this advice because, on top of fasciitis, I developed severe toe pain by using this product.  I then had to by a second product anyway that, thankfully, eliminated the toe pain.  Even though this is less expensive than other night splints, it may do more harm than good.  Go with a firm, non-toe injurying splint instead 
 i ALWAYS give rave reviews to books, but not this one.  i am a happily married romantic at heart, and this is the only book i have never in my life been able to finish.  (i average 35 books a year).  it was just bland and boring and oh so.......boring.  do not recommend, though, i would have liked to with such a romantic title : 
 Psychology Today purports to deliver the latest trends in psychological studies to the layman, but what it really delivers is pop psychology and a whole lot of advertisements.  I give the magazine one star for a very snazzy layout, and a second star for hiring writers that don't insult the reader's intelligence by abusing alliteration (unlike another magazine supposedly aimed at intelligent adults).  However, the content is consistently concerned more with pop culture than with the lives of real people.  I have also noticed a bias against introverts in article after article that attacks shyness as a serious character defect, rather than simply a personality trait (so, introverts, if you want to avoid yet another lecture on how your way of relating to the world is intrinsically wrong, avoid this rag) 
 Am I the *ONLY* person who thinks Thoreau was an arrogant snob who did nothing but whine? Maybe it's because I'm an Englishman in America but all I hear is American educational institutions praising Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience". I don't deny that he has made some points worth considering in his book but many people have made the same points without whining and railing at humanity.  I would dearly like to say I had the patience to read this book all the way through but it is perhaps the only book I've ever read that I couldn't finish. I found it hard to separate Thoreau's genuine, honest observations from his juvenile complaining.   The phrase that most ran through my head (shortly before I deleted the book) was "o'erweening arrogance". The man's arrogance is astounding. He supposes himself so far superior to his peers in EVERY way.  I found his writing to be confused and self-serving. He could barely hold a topic for one page at a time before veering off on to another, entirely unrelated one. He skips from subject to subject and often contradicts himself within the same chapter.  I got the electronic version of this book and, to date, it is the only book I have actually deleted. So, I'd love to pepper my "critique" with quotes that I found completely offensive and juvenile but that would mean getting the book again and I *really* don't want to do that 
 The radio for the boom box worked.  The CD player did not work.  I had to return it to be repaired or replaced. I do not have it back yet 
 It's too bad Mr. Ridley doesn't put as much effort into examining the effects of the social environment as he does into genetics. Obviously genes have an important effect on behavior...DUH...what else is new? Mr Ridley need to enroll in graduate school and spend several yrs. researching the effects of social structure on behavior before he writes another book. He grossly over simplifies research methodologies while displaying his biased opinions based on anecdotal information. This book is not a balanced discussion of research but a vehicle for his poorly-informed views 
 The book sells for astronomical price because SOA chooses it. It's simple and standard material and there's about half a million people in this country who qualifies to write. Unless somebody else pays for you, go for another book, or a simple study notes will do 
 I really wanted to like this book. The premise seemed interesting and the art had a certain style that appealed to me. With that in mind... It just felt like the only reason that the main character, Matty Roth, was a photographer was so he could be dragged all over Manhattan to show readers what has become of famous NYC landmarks. The main character seemed so two dimensional, I was actually wishing he would die becausse he is a civilian meant to be nothing more than the readers eyes. Readers are givin next to no background on either Matty, or why there's a DMZ in New York City. Having events occur virtually without context, I didn't care what happened next in the story at all. Even though this book is supposed to show New Yorkers' strength of how they try to continue their lives fairly normally, it just ends up feeling like they had no problems accomplishing any of it, like a pre established garden of Eden in the middle of a war zone. Mostly I tried to enjoy the art. It'll probably sit on my shelf, never to be touched again, so no one else will have to read it either 
 While I agree with reviews indicating that the author has a beautiful style, I was tremendously disappointed at the lack of payoff in this book.  Yes, there are interesting situations, compelling descriptions... but the entire last third or so of the book fails to deliver anything worthy of the set-up prior to that. Did the author just get tired out?  Too committed to just tying up loose ends from the previous book?  This was quite a bummer as I wanted to like the book and had invested time and emotion up to that point 
 Our book club read this last month and not a single member had anything good to say about this book.  As the facilitator, I was surprise by the consensus since we usually have at least one or two members who love the monthly selection.  The writing is disjointed to the point that Ms. Krauss loses her reader.  Then when she introduces the potential that many of the chapters might just be imaginary interactions between the characters, the reader is left extremely frustrated.  I really cannot imagine how Ms. Krauss' novel has garnered so many stellar reviews 
 I think coffee taste is more of a personal preference, but I was not fond of this decaf coffee.  I always drink my coffee black and I didn't get the rich coffee taste that I like with the Don Francisco brand.  Illy has a great reputation so I am guessing their non-decaf coffee is outstanding, they just need a little work with the decaf 
 This book contains 203 pages of text including 6 full pages of maps. There is plenty of blank space for ends of chapters and large chapter titles.  Additionally provided: table of contents - 2 pages, acknowledgments - half page, end notes - 35 pages,and index - 8 pages.  By describing anti-Israel influences, the author inadvertently guides me to them and gives me encouragement that there may be a meaningful opposition in the world to Zionism.  For years I have noted a decided favoritism toward Israel in this country, particularly in our news and entertainment industry and in the actions of our politicians.  I have feared that I might be part a small minority that questions this favoritism.  The author's arguments are unconvincing.  He suggests that "realities on the ground" require that Israel retain settlement territories that have been heavily developed by Israelis.  The true reality is that these territories were stolen by Israel.  Indeed the very founding of Israel was enabled by stealing land from the native Arab population and running off a sufficient number of Arabs to give Israel a large Jewish majority.  That is hardly democracy in action, and the author fails to present any argument to justify it.  He presents as a basic axiom the requirement to maintain this large Jewish majority.  It is Zionism at it's essence, that somehow the world owes the Jews their own country regardless of how it is obtained.  Surprisingly, the author speaks of the asymmetry of criticism against Israel and Palestinians, saying that it is the intellectuals and elites that are critical of Israel, while critics of the Palestinians come from lower ranks.  To me, this says that the people who are educated and think with any depth are the ones critical of Israel.  The author complains bitterly that Israel is being singled out for criticism while atrocities by other nations are being ignored.  This is weak.  First, atrocities by other nations are certainly under criticism, and the offenses of other nations do not diminish the offenses by Israel.   Second, Israel's actions in the Middle East are of critical importance to the world energy supply and peace.  If there is any singling out of Israel, it is the pro-Israel influence in the U.S. where the news media gives endless coverage to Israel, where we are frequently bombarded with Holocaust images, and where our government provides Israel with more foreign aid than to any other country.  There are other illogical arguments made by the author, but addressing all of them goes well beyond this relatively brief book review.  On the whole, I was impressed with the manipulative presentation offered by the author.  It is amazing to what extent people will go to justify their illogical proposals 
 It got to me and upon my sons birthday and opening it (a month or so later) it worked for about an hour and since has not registered speed correctly. A huge disappointment and waste of my money 
 i must say, when i set out to read this book i was looking for a quick book of short stories. This book has two majorly poor qualities: the majority of it is not understandalbe and the other parts are boring 
 I support the other comment made by a poster: Editor, where were you when this book was written? The writing is so terrible. Maybe .37 is too much for this book actually 
 I have had my MSCE+I and CCNA certifications since 1999, and I am an experienced Windows network administrator.  I purchased this book when I decided to round out my resume with an A+ certification.  I just want to voice my agreement with those who have given a similar rating, especially with respect to the O/S Technologies Exam and networking in general.  This text is full of errors and emphasizes legacy technology.  Regardless of whatever potential value it might have as an aid to pass the certification examinations, this text could very well do more harm than good as a general training tool for a novice technician working in a real-world production environment due to its many errors and a novice's inability to tell a good text from a bad.  In my humble opinion, one should simply not buy this book 
 This has not aged well. The scripts are silly, the acting is of the "chewing up the scenery" variety. Gale Storm no longer seems cute; she comes across as annoyingly perky. Spend your money on something else 
 Not as well written as I'd like, with kind of dull descriptions.  It's a chronicle of a girl's experience in foster homes, after her mother murders a boyfriend for a bad breakup.  Other reviewers have mentioned that the narrative voice is not convincing as coming from a teenaged girl.  I have to agree.  Also, the ending was forced and saccharine.  I thought, after all that, that there would be some lingering damage, but no, the perky heroine lifts herself up and is apparently fine.  Or maybe Oprah just likes a happy ending?  (The movie ending is a little different, not much better. 
 I honestly tried to read this book.  But the author suffers from Diarrhea of the Mouth. Andy is a wiz with his Macs, but don't expect him to offer up concise advise. I have thrown the book across the room on several occasions, only to pick it up later and AGAIN try to glean some information from his CONSTANT diatriabes about, well, everything not related to useful information.  I'm sure Andy is a blast at parties, and cleans up at Trivial Pursuit...  But, If you want a good, solid, easy to read OSX book...  This is not the book for you.     I can't imagine the pre-edited version...  I shudder at the thought 
 I own a strategy guide for every Final Fantasy game, and this one was sorely disappointing.  I think the only guide that has been worse than this is the FF9 'PlayOnline' joke (that no longer exists online).  The strategy guide leaves out several key elements of the game (such as how to find Aeris' limit break BEFORE disc 2), how you can reach certain areas, where to find items, who to have in your party in certain areas, etc.  The information was blatantly inaccurate or extremely confusing.  Some of the maps are mislabeled and look more like a random assortment of screenshots than a coherent guide.  All in all, don't waste your money on this guide.  You're better off buying the Brady version instead 
 This magazine used to be THICK, fun to read, full of information. But that was about 5 years ago. Now it's just a flimsy looking mag filled with vulgarities and non-sense. The editorial is almost always filled with political opinions. I won't renew my subscription 
 I've given this book two tries---- once with my eyes and once with my ears (iPod). I just can't get through it. Sometimes the starred reviews in SLJ and Booklist completely mystify me-- this is a book that needs some filling in. The characters have the complexity of line drawings. I bet there's a good book here; it just needs a few more drafts.   For example, the protaganist's new friend--- I'm sure there are less believable characters in literature, but I can't think of any at the moment. And the little goofy bits of description--- the father remarks that the boy's school smells like every other school, like chalk. Ok, who here can dredge up the odor of chalk? Have I just missed the odor of chalk all these years working in a school? It all reminds me of narrators who refer dramatically to the smell of blood-- when really that's a remark that only a vampire character is justified in making. Have I been missing the well-known smell of blood all these years, too? Good lord, the smell of chalk. Granted, the father character also says the school smelled of gym socks, and that smell would apply to the locker room. Quibbles, yes. But when the characters are so dull, my mind drifts to the little annoying flaws of language. Whose doesn't?   When I saw Chicken Boy was up for a 2008 Grand Canyon Reader Award, I thought I would just chime in here. Different strokes, I guess--but kids will be bored by this book. Librarians, be ready to contend with the smell of boredom 
 Given that Professor Dahl has written numerous books on democracy and is considered an expert in the field, "On Democracy" is surprisingly uninteresting. The book covers various aspects of democracy (history, preconditions, systems of government, elections, and its relationship to capitalism) superficially. With the exception of a few (very occasional) facts, the book provides little beyond what an educated person with an interest in democracy (e.g., college and reads the newspaper) already knows.  Part of the problem is the writing: it is meandering, thus the book's 200 pages are not enough to go into any issue in depth. Part of the problem is a lack of focus, for example, Dahl spends several pages trying to show that assembly based democracy is not practical for large populations (which should be obvious), while not a single page on how democracies in practice assess the opinions of large populations (e.g., polling, districting, etc.).  A deeper problem may simply be that Dahl is a political "scientist". Law and economics seem to have long since stripped polisci of logic and empiricism, both of which are missing here.  Why two stars (instead of one)? The book is well organized and does provide a framework for thinking about democracy; Dahl just never develops it 
 I have the same rice cooker (except with induction heating) and wanted to purchase this item as a wedding gift.  Well, when I get this item, I notice the box seems a little less than new.  I notice that the rice measuring cup is missing, the manual is worn and there is the scent of rice in the machine.  IT WAS A USED ITEM.  Note that the item is not sealed but Amazon should have known.  Very disappointed, especially for an item this expensive 
 I am a fan of Eggleston's photos but I feel that the reproduction of these photos kept me from liking them more. A couple of the images seemed slightly out of focus (the grandmother and child as an example) and on more than a few the color seemed flat or washed out. I'm not sure if it's because of the paper or the printing, but compared to the recent reissue of the Eggleston "Guide" book, "2 1/4" did not measure up. And given that this was published by Twin Palms I was very surprised and disappointed since I liked many of the images. I recently picked up the Stephen Shore "Uncommon Places" book of color photographs and thought that had excellent paper/color reproduction (highly recommended). In the end I've decided to return this book, but I'll keep on enjoying William Eggleston's Guide 
 I recommend you not buy this book or cd.  I listened to the CD and it was too elementary 
 If you want to know the God who is crazy about you...loves you so much He sent His Son to die for you...order "TrueFaced" instead.  This is NewAge fluff, none of it jives with the Bible 
 This book is not so very good. I bought it and I'm not very happy about it. I thought that I found a good book but it's only a book for novice. Absolutely novice. A lot of things in one place but nothing good to find 
 ...and was left putting the book down every two seconds because I was annoyed by it. It is not marvelously written; in fact, I found myself correcting his sentence structure and grammar in at least every other paragraph, if not more (editor, please?). It's an interesting enough plot, but the way it's put forth is mindnumbing. The non-fiction information he put in there could have been ten times more interesting in two ways. First, if the information had been summarized in about two pages. And second, if he hadn't pretended like everyone reading this book was in the second grade and had minimal comprehension abilities.   I'm usually a fast reader, but this book (a quick 415-page paperback read) took me more than a month, just because I had to keep putting it down. If you simply want something to "frighten" you, or are unusually interested with autopsies (there are about five million in the book), and don't care about poor writing, pick this book up 
 Dean Koontz delivers a rocky build-up to the closing scenes in Sole Survivor, but it ultimately stumbles badly on the hocus-pocus of evil government with good science & stock chase scenes pulled from only the worst of B-movies.  The main character, Joe Carpenter, is lost in a world without his wife and daughters, who were killed in a mysterious plane crash. But a chance meeting with a woman photographing the gravesite, who briefly tells Carpenter about the crash, leads to a shoot-em-up with the woman nearly being killed by her pursuers.  The reader then enters a realm of mediocre sci-fi as Carpenter, a former crime reporter for a major daily newspaper, begins to piece together snippets of clues to find out for himself what happened during the crash and if any of his family actually survived.  Family members with loved ones killed in the crash are visited by the mystery woman. Many of the people then become victims, killing themselves in violent ways, but are seemingly at peace while acting on the whim. As Carpenter closes in on revealing the secret, the good versus evil falls into the lap of big government, a big corporation and the mystery woman who knows everything.  If Koontz wanted the book to read like a draft for a possible X-Files episode, then he was successful. But even the producers of that once highly successful program would have needed several pens to edit a story that had so much potential, only to fail due to Koontz ultimately plummeting into the world of cliches.   
 This book is an okay book for those just beginning to talk with their kids about their adoption stories.  In simple language it tells about the day they met.  In my experience as an adoption professional, though, most adoption stories--at least domestic--include some contact with the birth mom and/or dad and perhaps their families.  This book would be richer if it were revised to include that contact 
 Most of the frugal tips in this book are really quite obvious to anyone with any financial sense.  There is nothing new or revolutionary about what the author is saying and most of her suggestions fall into the basic financial planning category.  She also repeats herself constantly.  The book could have been about half as long if she didn't rehash the same points over and over.  This is not a good book if you are serious about finding ways to save money.  The religious overtones throughout the book are a bit offensive, as well. 
 this book is retared...i would never let no one else read this it really that bad...i cry it was so bad...every time i look at it makes me sneeze...now that bad...i just sneeze i look at it...it give laTisha ga 
 Wow was that ever awful! I'd write more but Im busy cleansing my DVD player after loading that steaming pile!! 
 Not good at all clearly a step down for Chely Wright from her first album 
 I struggled with the forced rhyme. I struggled with the story itself. I think the rhyme scheme got in the way for me. I was so lost and uninterested so frequently.  I will put it away, and I will pick it up later some time.  Maybe I'm not "there" yet 
 If you must see a cannibal film stick to Cannibal Holocaust. the grindhouse release is well worth the money. However the grindhouse release of ferox is just awful. The picture quality is horrendous. The movie is lacking any redeemable quality. There are a few violent moments, but just a few. One of the absolute worst italian horror/exploitation films made. If Cannibal Holocaust is the citizen kane of cannibal films, then ferox is the plan 9. 
 This band has had some interesting moments over the years, particularly their seminal release, "Up In It", which featured alt.punk classics like, "retarded."  THey made an MTV worthy breakthrough with "Gentleman" but after that their legacy just sort of trailed off... This album yearns to be a come back album, along the lines of "Gentleman" but it comes up short in every way.   The main plus to this album is the funky, groovy drum beats and guitar hooks, but they sound dry and uninspired compared to earlier whigs efforts. Also, the lyrics are grating and monotonous.... you'd think he'd find something else to sing about after all these years, right!? If you are a die hard fan, then of course you'll want this album for your colleciton, but if you're new to the whigs, start with Gentleman 
 "A Facsimile of the original edition" ? My mother has an original copy (7th edition) which was handed down to her & it is now held together with tape & love. Borrowing that book from my mom made me a bit nervous so I wanted to get one for myself. I did a lot of reading of reviews & finally decided on this one. Yes it does have all recipes that the original had but without ANY cooking temperature (electric, gas or internal temps). Even the time tables on page 32 & 33 with cooking times didn't have the temperatures that they needed to be cooked at. My mother's does except the charts are in a different area of her book. I am sorry but I am not going to sit down with a brand new cook book & take my mother's book & write down what temperature every single recipe needs to be cooked at. There was one recipe that state "cook for 20 mins. at a very high temp" & my mothers book said " cook for 20 mins. at 450 F". It almost looks like the temperatures were purposely left out because everything else appeared to be the same. Copyrights problems?  I am returning this book because it didn't meet my expectations & felt it was misrepresented 
 I read the back cover of this book and immediately knew most of what would happen.  As soon as I met the character who would turn out to be the driver, I knew the rest of the story.  It was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing.  The story's decent.  The text flows nicely, and the suspension of disbelief is strong, but where did Nick's originality go?  Where's the sweet and innocent charm of The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Nights in Rodanthe?  It seems like he's run out of steam, or didn't care too much about this one.  A decent book to read, but don't expect anything spectacular as you would with his earlier work 
 god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, "then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after."  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.            
 Nice looking toaster, makes good toast, but one MAJOR problem that I've had.  When making toast, especially when only making one slice, the slice pops right out of the toaster. If I'm not there to catch it, (like that old "I Love Lucy" episode where Lucy always catches the toast from the toaster, when making Ricky breakfast), I end up picking my toast up from the counter, or sometimes the floor.  Unfortunately there's no way to correct this without having to go through the hassle of having it repaired, so I guess I'm stuck with this "projectile toaster".  By the way President Bush, I think I might have found one of those "weapons of mass destruction" 
  Although there may be some good information in this book, it is difficult to extract due to the numerous fictional anectodotes.  A concept cannot even be expanded upon before some character such as Suzy Shrink or Caitlin Caterer (the alliteration is very annoying) is used in some senario in an attempt to highlight a tax concept. These little stories pop up 2 -3 times a page.  It makes for very frustrating reading if you are really trying to get answers.  And honestly, the alliteration just kills me.    
 I am glad I read this book before I saw Johnny Damon in a Yankee uniform, because the book is boring and could have been written by a tenth grader. Damon is in love with himself, talks trash about his ex-wife and the whole book sounds like a bad tv interview. I can happily look at Johnny Damon in Yankee gear and know it's no loss to the Red Sox 
 Jim Leher's novel was a great disappointment to me.  An individual so accomplished, articulate and engaging left all that behind when he sat down to write this novel.  The story line could have been interesting but I was greatly distracted by the simplistic character development and somewhat implausable series of events.  If Lehrer chooses to pursue this avocation I urge he seek ways to enliven his characters and develop a more pictureque manner of writing.  Frankly, this novel was less gripping than a poorly cast and directed high school drama.  
 We actually paid money to see this movie in a theater. We sat through the entire thing waiting for it to have some socially redeeming value. We left not only disappointed, but angry. Outraged.   Yes, I know what it was about. Of course, I didn't know that going in, that would have been nice. And I couldn't believe the arrogance and the audacity of celebrating a culture of elitism that thrives upon decadence and depravity. Why are we watching this? And WHY ARE WE PAYING FOR IT?  It is even more obvious, a handful of years later, that Tom Cruise is "not OK." That Nicole Kidman has her own brand of dark drama going on, a drama that is not that far removed from Britney Spears and Anna Nicole Smith. It's larger than life and darker than insanity. We should do something about it. I wish I knew what. But I don't want it with my popcorn 
 That one day 4 year olds will be able to actually read this book. This book is not meant for kids aged 4-8. It is well beyond what they understand. Frankly , i don't even think a 4 year old can even read this. Nice pictures. But unfortunately , i don't enjoy buying a book for pictures. I can get pictures anywhere. I didn't need to purchase this book to get them. Anyway , don't buy this book unless you enjoy paying a high price for pictures. With regards to the age group. Unless you have a gifted 4 year old this book is a waste of time for him/her 
 Jenny does not have to use God's name in vain to show her nonbelief in a Deity and love DOES mean having to say you're sorry, and meaning it.    Watch "Charly" (it is a wonderful film even if you're not LDS).  Even though the girl dies at the end, just like this one, the film is not utterly depressing, like this one.  There is still light and life and hope and faith for the ones left behind to live on.  Perhaps that is what believing in God does for people--it does not necessarily make you a good person (just as not believing does not necessarily make you a bad person), neither does it guarantee salvation in the next life or a heavenly life on Earth, but it does give us hope--hope that we will see our loved ones again, a hope which Oliver does not have.  Once is enough 
 Buy one of the other versions with special features. This is the older, first-generation DVD with NO features. Nothing. Plus, this is a flipper disc!  A great movie worth owning.. just not this edition 
 This book has some practical tips, but mostly it's very shallow and I don't think it addresses the real problems that come up with raising families and children 
 Glam rock died for a reason. All these revivalist compilations need to stop being produced. - Thus says the Pellingto 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  It had a few basic steps, but they were limited and the designs offered were not ones I would ever make for me or friends.  The best part of the book was the first chapter on materials and tools.  There are better beginning books (Bead on a wire) with more tips and design ideas than this.  I sent mine back 
 A generation before there was a Left Behind, there was The Late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey and C. C. Carlson. This is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of America. A phemomenal best seller, it was a watershed event in the growing Christian publishing industry. For many Christians, their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future. A generation later, many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of Holy Scripture, sensationalistic attempts to correspond Biblical prophecies to current events, and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated.  So why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism? Well, while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events, it still resounds for much of the Church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by Lindsey and other "prophecy pundits." While it is certainly true that Tim LaHaye has replaced Lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism, it cannot be denied that Left Behind was made possible by this book.  Part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form. For LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, it was the pulp novel. Back in 1970, Lindsay and C. C. Carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic expose. Like most books of this type (e.g., The Bermuda Triangle, Chariots of the Gods?, The Philadelphia Experiment, The Population Bomb), it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts. Like most of these books, it was a peculiar period piece of American life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams. Like most of these books, it is laughable in retrospect.  If the book were out of circulation and I were reviewing this for historical purposes, I would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp. The original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong. After all, it was the 1970's when wild conspiracy theories, distrust of any traditional authority, and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage. When viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age, a UFO invasion, a famine around the corner, and California falling into the Pacific Ocean, the authors' claims of the coming Armageddon look downright trendy.  However, in the intervening years, the revisions of this book just kept piling up. Make a bad prediction? No problem, edit the book with the old gaffes removed, add a few trendier predictions, and release it as a new book. Lindsey, now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years, still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis (Carleton's contribution is more stylistic) despite his failed scenarios. Lindsey's original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s (he even wrote a book The 1980's: Countdown to Armageddon trumpeting this belief). Well that didn't pan out, so he then jumped on the Y2K bandwagon (another of his books was Planet Earth 2000 A.D.: Will Mankind Survive?). Oops, wrong again. First communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is Islam (a more recent book is The Everlasting Hatred: The Roots of Jihad). When one bogeyman falls, he is quick to insert a new one in its place.  Between the failed predictions, the hilarious misreadings of the original languages, the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology, and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the Biblical prophecies "right before our eyes", it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things. This trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs - notably the Left Behind series of novels.  If you can find a copy of the original version from 1970, it can be interesting in much the same way as a Brady Bunch episode - not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time. Just as many Catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the Baltimore Catechism, fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie A Thief in the Night.  However, for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy, it is best to pass. For all its success as a cultural marker, its usefulness in properly understanding Biblical prophecy is basically nil. For this, its original purpose, The Late Great Planet Earth is completely worthless.  
 I happen to be a voracious reader and especially like books with an air of history about them.   I was very keen on reading this book, I liked its reviews and liked its name - found it quite intriguing. But reading it, was quite unlike my expectations. I found it utterly dry and uninteresting. The book seemed drier than the deserts it talks about. I did manage to finish it, though.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 I have had this cabinet for about six months. The doors when filled with CD's sag and cannot be realigned.  This problem must be common as one other reviewer had the same problem 
 Creating a DVD, using iMovie to iDVD EVEN on a PowerMac G5 Quad (superfast, supergreat!) is a 4-5 hour process. A 10-15% FAILURE rate, due to POOR media quality is UNACCEPTABLE! The 'quality control' at MEMOREX sucks!   It is NOT so much the cost of the bad DVDs, but, there are superficial scratches on the recording surface of 5-8 out of every 50 I have used, causing a failure to burn, after a VERY lengthy set up process.   I will be using VERBATIM blank media  . .FROM NOW ON! 
 I can't believe I was forced to buy this book from my school for an Oral Communications class. The book has almost no bearing on communication in an office or business setting. It's overrun with ethics, empathy, and bull about feedback. Even the glossary dosent give straight deffinitions. Instead of a deffinition it gives examples. I HATED THIS BOOK. I can say without exageration that I will use this book for kindling in my fireplace 
 I wanted to like this book, I really did.  I read it cover to cover, expecting to find some insight, as the title states, about what kinds of foods are best for my family, what is good to eat, what to stay away from.  I commend the author for her thorough research, but in the end, this book should have been titled:  "What Not To Eat - Which is Just About Everything - Since It's all been contaminated by pollutants, pesticides, chemicals and big business."  I learned nothing new - any educated consumer knows about how big business controls what we eat, how chemicals and pesticides are poisoning everything - but this book depressed me.  It did not tell me what I could eat safely.  I came away with the impression that nothing is safe to eat or drink anymore.  It rather reminded me of when we were all supposed to run out and get duct tape and plastic to protect ourselves - what is the point of this information? - the truth is that none of us as consumers can really do anything about what is happening with our food supply, even "organic" food is not what you think it is.  This book really gave no suggestions at all about what to eat - just that nothing is safe to eat.  It is true you will not look at eating or food shopping the same way after reading this book - you will not want to eat ever again 
 Technically this was an exercise in tautology, and albeit the author admits that they are events not presented chronologically/linerally, the whole thing came off as a repetitive scrapbook of free associative ramblings. Cultural allusions were off and revealed just a shallow dip into areas of interest; just deep enough to create a character for a sexual fantasy. Every D/s relationship defines it's own perimeters, but this is the most silly top from the bottom (with a side of kink) i've ever read. Any girl who needs to prover her worth and devotion by degrading any and all around her isn't creating a deeper bond of submission, but pathetically wallowing in a misplaced sense of value (with a heaping side of self-image issues).

 This series may be good for a laugh. Some of the writing is engaging.   But the premise is absurd.   WHY, in this day and age, should anyone accept the world-view of the Bible? A book that tells us to buy and sell slaves, stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe's beliefs, and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of Mt. Sinai?   In a sense, Bible believers have been "left behind" since the 1700s Enlightenment. Tom Paine's "The Age of Reason" showed the God of the Bible to be a cruel, vindictive monster. And what did Thomas Jefferson call the book of Revelations? "The ravings of a madman."   Read this series, if you like. Enjoy parts of it. But make no mistake: to take any of this seriously, you have to regress to a prehistoric world-view, before men learned to think, to ask questions; before logic or science -- a time when dazed, superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth, if they didn't grovel humbly enough to their supposed god.   Do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one? When the "sheep" are raptured up to heaven, their clothes are left behind. So heaven is a nudist colony?   The basic contradiction, of course, lies in using worldly action (some of it exciting) to proselytize for the unworldly, the supernatural.   But why should we care whether any of the "good" guys gets killed? And why should THEY mind -- won't they go straight up to heaven? That's what they WANT, isn't it? Why even lift a finger against the "bad" guys -- didn't Christ say, "Resist not evil"?   Worried about who will win? "God" is infinitely powerful. So Jesus (who is 1/3 of God -- or something like that) is sure to win when Armageddon rolls around, in book 12 of the series. And the "sheep" -- the believers -- will happily worship him, looking just like the pictures of dim-witted, bovine people you see in the tracts Jehovah's Witnesses leave at your door.   The going price for a used copy of "Tribulation Force" is one cent. Does that tell you something?   Actually, the story-telling is worth more. The basic premise is worth less. Perhaps it averages out 
 I evidently don't have the patience of the other readers who posted here.  I have rarely read anything so dull, with characters so wooden and impossible to be interested in.  Not since "And Ladies of the Club" have I encountered a novel so absolutely a waste of precious hours of my life that I can never get back.  Needless to say, I can't finish it--could hardly even begin it.  I'm giving up 
 I don't mind using bisquick or jiffy mixes but packaged soup mixes and canned soup have so much sodium.  I'd have preferred to see use of fresh ingredients, they don't take long to prepare 
 My primary complaint with this book was its predictability.  Less than halfway through, I knew exactly what was going to happen, and I wasn't wrong.  So it was just a matter of slogging through the rest to get to the end.  I also wasn't overly amused by most of the so-called witticisms and amusing one-liners of several characters.  It wasn't endearing, only annoying.    All in all, pretty disappointing 
 The book can be used as a repository of useful anecdotes. However, it doesn't bring much new. If you're a beginner in the SCM field then it will definitely open your eyes to some operational challenges companies face all the time. But for the experienced professional, this book is of no great value (some of the anecdotes are interesting though)... We, as supply chain professionals, need to upgrade our thinking and admit that our role is not to eliminate uncertainty but rather mitigate it... and that's the best we can do... as such, one cannot possibly come up with a bullet proof model but rather an approach to handle risk... the key attribute to all of this thinking is how much risk we can live with? that's it... truly, that's all that's needed to be told! My reaction to the example of Apple reducing its inventory and then getting a major supply disruption because of some disaster in Asia is So? What can you do? The only thing you can is to define your tolerance for risk and conduct some tradeoff analysis: what matters more? keeping low level of inventory and therefore reducing likelihood and scope of obsolescence (tangible)? or is it minimizing potential for lost sales (intangible)? That's the basic question 
 There have been a dozen or more "boy's books" lately, most notably the exceptional Raising Cain, by Kindlon and Thompson.  Most of them are not worth the bother, and this compendium is at the top of that list 
 I would have given this film 0 stars if possible.  This film was long, boring, and painful to watch.  If you like Jane Austen films or other BBC period films, do not be deceived by this one; it is nothing like those types of films 
 This book had some really wonderful authors in it and yet I found it lacking.   I have to say that whoever wrote the back cover description made these stories sound more interesting than they really were. ~The first story is set in Hamilton's Antia Blake series inbetween "Blue Moon" and "Obsidian Butterfly". There was a plot and a halfway decent one, but it really went no where. It seemed it all was resolved while Anita was messing around with Jean-Claude. That's really what this story was centered around, sexual tension between Anita and Jean-Claude. ~The second story was set in Harris's Sookie Stockhouse series. I've never read any books from this series, so that might be why I couldn't get into this story. It really wasn't all that interesting. The characters sat around in a circle and had a chat and it all was just kinda boring. These first two stories, seemed like the authors just plopped them out, so the book could have thier names on it and be sure that die hard fans of the two popular series would buy it. ~The third story was set in Davidson's Undead series and I have to say that I actually enjoyed this one. Like all of Davidson's works it was a light and fun read. You don't have to of read any of her Undead series to follow it. ~The fourth story was one of Knight's and it was set in the same world as her story in the "Hot Blooded" anthology. I actually liked this story, but several people who I talked to didn't like it. They had trouble adjusting to the setting. I have to admit that the story in "Hot Blooded" was much better and was one of my favorites in that book. Because I read that story I could easily slip into this story. It's set with Arthurian characters as vampires and sounds utterly stupid, but I got into it. ~The last story was by Taylor who is an author I had never heard of. This story was alright. Nothing too thrilling and wasn't horrible to read and didn't leave you with a "well that was pointless" feeling at the end. The plot was interesting and acutally went somewhere. The characters were well developed. I think this was probably one of the better written stories in the book 
 The series started off so well, it's sad to see it end so badly. This book is just a collection of random events, there really isn't a plot. None of the questions raised throughout the series are answered.  The first book was great, I wish I had stopped there. 
 This book was easy enough to read, it just wasn't what I expected from Quindlen.  I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.  The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.  Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.  The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young "sew-your-wild-oats" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the "perfect" father. I just did not find such an occurrence likely.  And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm. Anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me, and a disappointment especially since I have been a Quindlen fan for many, many years 
 Since the total carbs are what is important for diabetics, this should not be recommended. It has 42 grams of carbs and only 4 grams of fiber per 1/2 cup of cooked pasta. This is almost the total amount of carbs allowed diabetics for a complete meal. Only 1/2 cup is the maximum of carbs for a meal. Who  can eat just one cup of pasta? It is very misleading to diabetics as "digestible carbs" has no meaning to them. Total carbs less fiber is what counts to a diabetic. Thus diabetics beware. If you want to eat it remember, 1/2 cup is a complete meal of carbs 
 I really enjoy the Ministry of Sound series, one of my favorites being the MoS High NRG Anthems cd, this cd although left me very dissapointed.  It has an incredible lack of energy, there is no trancy sound, no euro sound, no nothing sound. This is generally the problem with American music anyways.  If you like mellow music, while this is still danceable it just isnt like gushing with energy. It is a weaker dance cd. Anywho, just be careful if you like more of the high energy pumping trancy stuff, this cd isn't for you 
  Come on --- let's have some sanity.  I thought American's were smarter than this.  If most American's believe this, worry 
 If you are considering this book to find ways to save money with homeschooling you would do better to avoid this purchase.  I was so excited to open this book and learn some new ideas.  What I found were a many educational/informational websites listed that were no longer valid.    In fact, the vast majority were no longer usable.   The rest of the information included was already known.  Don't waste your money or time 
 way to small of a cushion. had to purchase another one from a local store 
 Psychology Today is just another Glamour/Cosmo/People disguised as a magazine discussing issues in psychology. This magazine used to be well-written and had more scientific data.  However, since the appointment of the new editor, headlines became similar to that of tabloid magazines all over. If you are interested in scientific data and research, this is NOT the magazine for you. I used to subscibe to Psychology Today but stopped renewing since I took more psychology classes becuase I found out that the magazine had no new insights to offer in the field of psychology at all 
 I place this book on the same level as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  Yes, this is a book of fiction, but its entire portrayal of the goddess Kali--widely worshipped today in India, and elsewhere around the world--and Her worshippers is not only slanderous but dishonest.  I don't for a moment believe that the author actually thinks those who worship Kali are all child-murderers, sadists, and psychopaths...but those he fictionally portrays are.    Worse, he portrays Kali as a demon.  This is comparable to writing a fiction book portraying Mohammed as a child molester or Jehovah as a sadistic voyeur.  Kali is the obvious choice, the easy one, as She combines the famous Western combination of Occidental prurience and horror at Oriental depravity.  Kali superbly fills this bill, as She is naked, black, and rules the dimension of death.    Kali is unknown to the TV-watching West save through movies like "Gunga Din" and "Indiana Jones" (the one that has the hidden temple in it).  Both of these films are based on the myth of thuggee--the Thugs--a creation of the British colonial racist imagination.  Sleeman (the Brit responsible for this bit of slander) cobbled up "evidence" with no basis other than his own hearsay and considerable store of contempt for the "wogs," and presto--you have Kali the goddess of murder.   Simmons's book is simply another thuggee story, albeit set in a modern context.  I will not dignify this trash by writing more about it 
 I paid too much from Amazon.  The subscription would be significantly less expensive straight from the magazine.  I learned my lesson 
 It sounded like a remix sung by someone else, not at all like the original.  My husband and I were very disappointed and because of it I haven't even opened the other CDs by KC & the Sunshine Band that I ordered.  Don't order this product 
 If you have someone in your life who is abusing their power, you don't stay silent: you leave, yell, report them, get away. To suggest that God has put madmen in your life to work out some issue with you is simply making excuses for an uncreative God who cannot teach important lessons unless abuse is on hand.  This is the travesty of Christianity and keeps too many people in situations that are harmful and destructive 
 Hum, the GOP and and the killing of innocents in the middle east is the party of death. The GOP and its destruction of the wilderness and wildlife is the party of death.  The GOP and its tax breaks for the obscenely rich is the party of death.  The GOP and it disregard for the constiution is the party of death.  The GOP and its push for faith-based policy instead of science or fact-based policy is the party of death.  The GOP and its hatred of women's sexuality is the party of death.. 
 My real rating is 1.5 stars. The book won't put you to sleep, but it's not going to teach you anything you won't have known glancing through newspaper articles for a few years. Readers will learn nothing about golf if they have any acquaintence with the sport: though the closest I've ever gotten to golf in my 47 years is frequently passing by a club shop in my neighborhood, I learned almost nothing about the sport from this book save uninteresting gossip about golfers who are now no longer prominent. Feinstein makes no attempt at analysis and no attempt to fit any of what he writes into any context: what the reader gets here is a sketch of an insular world with no acknoledgment of that insularity. Hence, for any but the big golf fan who wishes cereal-box writing to pass time, the book will be useless. Bad points: besides that mentioned, the prose is (as mentioned in my title) in large measure cliches and reads, as other reviewers have pointed out, like a newspaper article knocked out under deadline and length pressure. For newspaper articles, such is no great handicap, but for a book is makes for tediousness. Next is a quibble, perhaps, but in the trade paperback edition I picked up the four photos on the cover are far better than the bubblegum snaps in the interior of the book. The book photos do nothing to enhance the content and waste paper. If you're looking for extremely light reading that will tax you none (as I was when I selected this book to read in a period of extreme exhaustion), "A good walk spoiled" will suffice. If you're looking for a good book, look elsewhere 
 I have all of the Ultra Chilled series and while I usually enjoy 80% of the music on those collections, with about half of that entering my permanent rotation, there were only three songs in this version that I could even sit through.   Those were the tracks done by Jon Hopkins, Bent, and Federico Aubele. The rest were not strictly chill, dreadful as music and some were depressing (a few tracks regarding death, including one where the singer is "waiting for suicide" or some such angst).  There is a bit of jazz, electronica, blues, dance and alternative music in Ultra Chilled 05, but little chill and nothing exemplary 
 I tried to like this book, but by page 61, I had to put it down. The main charachter, Helen, is a self-absorbed tramp and an unfit mother. She kisses people on a whim. She flirts and sleeps with anyone in town. She talks about how much she misses her daughter, who is away at camp, but I don't believe that she thinks of anyone by herself. She drops the F-bomb casually, as if that were speech becoming of a lady...which she is not. The plot is absurd. That she could be as callous and crude as she is represented to be and as popular as she is also purported to be, is impossible. This character is lewd, obstinant, selfish, childish, and impetuous. Do not pick this book up unless you admire loose women who are horrible mothers. Disgusting, and not a very funny book, either 
 Over half of this movie consists of scenes taken  from the original 1939 classic film directed by Zoltan Korda. Even those scenes can't disguise the remake's network TV-movie quality. Beau Bridges is generally a good actor,  but he is terribly miscast on this film. Go rent both versions of The Four  Feathers and see it for yourself 
 Even though I am compulsive about finishing books that I start, I just cannot bring myself to waste more time with this one. It is boring.  The material is not new. The ideas are not new.  This is just a rehash of material that is regularly published in The Nation, and has been debated for decades.  I do give Ms Pollitt credit for being a very talented and brave writer. However, I did not look to this book for style, this is a book on politics, and in that area, it is very weak.  Ms Pollitt is one of the bright lights of contemporary feminism, which shows what a weak state the political field is in. Feminism is floundering, the left is lost, the right has gone off the deep end, the center is adrift. American politics is a mess.  When one of our most talented political writers can only bore me, what can we look forward to this political season 
 In the past, I used to distance myself from certain rock genres because of a bad first experience. I'd be introduced to band, not like it, and claim the entire genre as being 'not for me'. The Forecast, however, has changed how I feel. I, personally, love a heartfelt emo record just as much as the next guy, but only because I was introduced to Jimmy Eat World and Spitalfield a couple of years back. Those bands allowed me to embrace the entire genre as a whole, and expand my emo knowledge. Imagine though, if you will, that I was new to emo. You, in theory, hand me a copy of "late night conversations" and tell me to listen. Of course, I hate it, and lose any interest I may have had in the genre. To make a long story short, the only good that came out of 'late night conversations' (an underproduced, generic, stale piece of s**t) was the revelation that came post-listen. Never judge an entire genre by the first or second band you're introduced to (from said entire genre). Not every metal band is Iron Maden. Not every punk-pop band is blink 182. Not every nu-metal band is linkin park. Not every 'emo' band is jimmy eat world. Every aspect of music has it's ups and downs, and the forecast is clearly one of the downs.  Now that I've bored you with an entire rant about nothing, I'd like you to PASS on 'late night conversations'. With your help, the forecast won't sell another record, and, in turn, leave the scene forever. Not recommended, duh 
 I truly disliked this biography, I thought it was poorly written & researched, melodramatic and frankly dull, given its subject matter.  I struggled to finish it.  Better books for insight into Alexandra are:  "Purple Secret" by John Rohl, et al. for its chapter on Alexandra's complex medical history; Robert Massie's "Nicholas & Alexandra" for its sympathetic understanding of Alix's traumatic childhood loss of her mother, and what it's like to be the parent of a hemophaelic (& despite Massie's inaccuracies, such as stating that Queen Victoria was strongly in favor of the marriage of Nicky & Alix & that she tried to talk Alix into it, when in fact she dreaded it), and, oddly enough, a biography of Alix's mother, "Princess Alice" by Gerard Noel, which gives excellent insight into Alix's parents and German background.  Also, "Advice to My Granddaughter" a collection of letters between Queen Victoria and Alix's oldest sister, Princess Victoria of Battenberg.  There is also "A Lifelong Passion", a collection of letters & diaries of Nicholas & Alexandra and the people around them. Any one of these has more value than Erickson's book.  I have not read Greg King's biography of Alexandra so cannot comment on it.  I've enjoyed Erickson's Tudor biographies, so I'm trying to be fair, but this one didn't cut it 
 There is so much scientific nonsense in the book that it is appalling! Working in the field of self-organized behavior in insects colonies, I can tell you that the presentation of that subject in the book is awful!  The number of wrong statement is so outrageously large that they are impossible to list below 10 pages of text!! It is a pity because such a book completely discredits a real scientific field that is confronted enough with new-age babble, scientific unfounded or wrong statements, pseudo-philosophical stupidities and so on. If you want to learn something real about "emergence" please stay away from this book. The rating of 1 star is just for the paper on which the book is written.. 
 I liked the idea of this, the concept, so much more than the book itself. The life story of a famous villain sounds intriguing, but this falls short in Maguire's hands. He is good with language and turns of phrase; almost Byzantine at times, his writing is appropriately other-worldy, but it becomes distracting and too obvious for the most part.  He is not good at telling an absorbing story, even given some wonderful stuff that is already established. This book is slow going, and not at all similiar in whimsy or wildness to its original material by L. Frank Baum.   This could have been such a fun and fascinating story, but it is not. It is about prejudice and politics, and it paints an Oz that I wouldn't want to visit. Baum's Oz was colorful and dangerous and strange.  Maguire has taken a children's classic and made a very adult prequel/parallel novel, and he twists the Baum work and the 1939 film to fit into his vision. It reminded me at times of fan fiction.  The Witch I know could not have been a sympathetic and misunderstood person; she wasn't a crusader for animal rights. I like my villains bad, not in some gray area.   And now the sequels will keep churning out. Son of a Witch, The Cowardly Wars, and so on. I can just imagine future titles like The Quadling Child, The Fall of the Monkey Kingdom, blah blah blah...     I'll pass 
 My tape cassette reads, "Updated for the 90's." Well, on this tape you will learn tired, worn closing lines that were old far before the 90's. My advice, get your hands on a book called THE ACCIDENTAL SALESMAN by Chris Lyttle. He also has a audio sales training products on this website 
 Before you get your hopes about the intellectual adventure Sokal & Bricmont have pretended to engage in, you should know what constitutes "scholarship" to these showmen by digging into their prior work a little.  Sokal, of course, wrote an article with many silly assertions, which he attributed, falsely, to French philosophers like Jacques Derrida (hence the "hoax") -- and he later tried to claim, with a straight face, that this pure fiction somehow "exposes" writers like Jacques Derrida.  His fans find this method of argument and analysis to be perfectly rigorous and logical.  Most real scholars who don't traffic in fictionalized hoaxes disagree.  Later, Sokal was forced to admit that he can't actually demonstrate anything wrong with any of Derrida's arguments.  It is fitting that Sokal chose Jean Bricmont, of all people, to co-author this book.  He needed somebody with a history of stretching the truth.  In his essay, "Postmodernism and its Problems with Science," Bricmont pretends to "argue" against the philosopher Gilles Deleuze with the following strategy: Deleuze at some point had made a historical reference to Hegel, and Bricmont writes:  "Of course, the reference to Hegel itself is amusing. Throughout his 'Greater Logic' [a work of Hegel's], one finds quite nonsensical remarks about limits, derivatives, and mathematics in general."  The logic is clear: anybody referring to Hegel in any discussion of mathematics is necessarily making a "nonsensical remark" because Hegel himself (according to Bricmont) has been known to make nonsensical remarks about mathematics.   Bricmont goes on to say that "the English translation [of Deleuze's book] inadvertently" mis-transcribes the mathematical formula he had originally written, an "error that thoroughly mangles the logic of the argument." In other words, Deleuze has written nonsense because his English translators had written nonsense.  But it gets even better.  In the very next sentence, Bricmont brings up the philosopher Michel Foucault to demonstrate the foolishness of that writer's work as well:  "And, in a comment on two previous books by Deleuze alone, where similar confusions about mathematics can be found, Michel Foucault wrote: 'I must speak about two books that are great among the great ones: _Difference and Repetition_ and _Logique du sens_ . . . But, maybe, some day, the century will be Deleuzian.'  Thus ends a major section of Bricmont's article. Bricmont has asserted that Foucault is clearly a charlatan because he approves of the "confusions about mathematics" that can reportedly be found in two *other* books by Deleuze, books which neither Sokal nor Bricmont have ever discussed. You might wonder why they never discuss Deleuze's well-known _Difference and Repetition_ to demonstrate the mathematical confusion that permeates the book. The answer: Because there is not a single mathematical formula or discussion of mathematics in _Difference and Repetition_. (And I am almost positive there is no such material in _Logique du sens_ either, but I haven't read that one in a while and don't have a copy.)  The reason Bricmont produced this lie is obvious: With Sokal, he is always desperate to draw the "big names" into his ring to give the impression he has "proven" something about them. But he can't do his normal operation of cutting and pasting some random excerpt -- carefully eliding all explanatory context -- because he knows too many people have read Foucault and will easily be able to call him out if he performs that maneuver. So he creates a ridiculous ad hominem argument by pointing to Foucault's praise of a couple of Deleuze's *other* books. And yet he knows that this is not good enough.  He knows it doesn't mean a thing if Foucault praises a couple of books that neither Sokal nor Bricmont can find anything wrong with; So he caves into that common undergraduate temptation to simply make up a lie to forge the necessary link: He invents the "fact" that these other books treat mathematical subjects, hoping to God that nobody in his audience has ever read those books -- just as he himself has never read them.  This is the Sokal affair in a nutshell. Aside from the "cut and paste" theater that makes no logical argument of any kind, it is entirely a matter of "scientists" making up stories about authors they have never read.  Let us remind ourselves about the only "positive" operation that Sokal and Bricmont have performed throughout this entire debate: That is, the operation of their "cut and paste" routine that supposedly demonstrates the meaninglessness of all these "prominent French intellectuals." Let us apply this operation to a random writer who penned the following statement:  "The elementary proposition consists of names. Since we cannot give the number of names with different meanings, we cannot give the composition of the elementary proposition. Our fundamental principle is that every question which can be decided at all by logic can be decided off-hand."  This excerpt -- which any man in the street will tell you is just as nonsensical as any of the excerpts Sokal cuts and pastes from other authors -- was written by Ludwig Wittgenstein in the _Tracticus Logico-Philosophicus_. According to the Sokal/Dawkins argument, this proves that the _Tracticus_ it complete and total nonsense, and that anybody who claims Wittgenstein writes anything more than meaningless gibberish is simply lying.  It is astonishing to me how quickly the ability to think logically falls away from ideologues like Sokal and Bricmont. It is understandable, however, if you recall that their project all along in this "affair" was to arrive at "truths" that they had already determined before they ever began their "investigations" -- truths about a whole range of authors they continually name, but have never actually read.  It seems fairly obvious to me who exactly are the charlatans and snake-oil salesmen in this entire "affair. 
 i usually dont add my two cents to highly reviewed music but in this fickle world you are only as good as your last album,and since we usually have to wait half a decade for you to spit out another this makes it worse. Ive seen Sade often in concerts and she has always had a great sound. this album is more pop. If it ain't broke don't fix it 
 As one of the reviewers noted in his review, I too have given many postive marks to those who have given five-star reviews for this novel; because some reviewers have made very good arguments in defense of this novel. [I never give negative marks on anything, even if I don't like a review, but I do give plenty of positives] Therefore, before you begin to throw the bricks and sling your arrows at me, please let me try and explain why I gave this book such low marks. First of all, I have tried to read--or at least decipher "Finnegans Wake" on four different occasions. I see from some of the reviews that anyone who attempts to disagree with this novels merits gets pelted with negative marks. For those of you who enjoy this novel, good for you! I do not profess to be as knowledgeable as some of you may be on this books merits. But I DO KNOW WHAT I LIKE! And I did not like this novel.  I first tried reading "Finnegans Wake" when I was in High School [it was not required reading] because I heard so much about it that I wanted to read something challenging. And challenging was an understatement. Realizing I was young, I attempted it much later while in the military. As if military life were not frustrating enough. It was not until I entered college, where I was reguired to read the novel, that I did so with true earnest: Due to the fact that I had to write an essay on the novel. I did receive an A minus on the paper. However, to be honest, this was after profusely littering the paper with as much b***s***, that to me Joyce littered his novel with. My professor must have seen some great merit in this essay---at least I felt so at the time.  However, wanting to truly understand the novel, I decided to REALLY try and capture what Joyce was trying to write. This too led to my dislike of the novel. Not so much with the books difficulty [although that was a problem], but with the simple question: Is it really worth reading? My answer? No! For me a novel has to give me that quality of enjoyment that makes the journey a delightful one. It has to capture my soul! This novel never did capture my soul. Give me unabridged editions [the only ones I read] of "The Count of Monte Cristo" by Dumas, "Les Miserables" by Hugo, "War and Peace" by Tolstoy [once is enough please] and more importantly, my favorite author, Dostoevsky, "Notes From the Underground," "Crime and Punishment,"  and "The Brothers Karamazov." These novels have given me something back in my life for the efforts that I put into reading them. They were profound and affected me deeply. They ALL gave me something in my life.   In conclusion, to those who find this novel worth the high praise it has garnered, I respectfully disagree. There are many great novels from which to choose to spend and evening, afternoon, or morning perusing. And while I do not look negatively on your opinions; if this book gives you enjoyment, then great for you. For me, however, the book gave me nothing. Nor do I wish to spend what little time we are alloted in our short life to spend it on this type of reading. That is my honest opinion. I am sure a 5 star review will give me many positive marks, but that is not why this review exists, or what I am about. This is just my honest opinion.   Today I am going to start reading two novels that I have been wanting to read for some time, but have put off until recently. "Growth of the Soil", by Knut Hamsun, and "The Master and Margarita," by Mikhail Bulgakov. I hear they are good novels; and after laboring over "Finnegans Wake" for too many hours in my life, I will begin to start on that reading list of mine. I'll let you know how these two novels work out. One thing I am pretty sure of, however, is that they will probably not frustrate me as much as "Finnegans Wake" did; and in fact, no other novel has been more of a disappointment to me than Joyce's so-called masterpiece 
 I don't know what the editor's at Aspen were thinking when they let this one fly.  Every other Aspen book I read was excellent.  This book is horrible.  It does not explain the black letter law well at all.  It offers vague examples to back up concepts that are never fleshed out in a way to make any sense.  Often the Examples questions are too vague to figure exactly what they are trying to test you on and the explanations will refer to ideas you have never discussed or to opinions in cases that as a beginner you would never have read.  There were some questions that the author assumes you will figure out from reading the actual cases but HE NEVER TELLS YOU TO READ THE ACTUAL CASES and since you dont have the cases you don't know to look into their opinions anyway.  Regardless, a beginner's book like this is supposed to help you understand the letter of the law in a straightforward way, not force you into wrangling with old American (and sometimes English) common law cases to divine what a rule is that you don't know yet.  Also, and this is what really burns me, the authors, of all the people in America who could probably write this book, have the most unclear, obstruse, and indirect writing style.  Anyone who knows how to edit would have noticed this from the start, but Aspen didn't and let it fly.  I have read 5 chapters and I can't recall anything I have learned so far (unlike all the other E&Es I have read.  Aspen, what is wrong with you people?  I am so disgusted right now I can't see myself ever paying for anything from you again.  $40 is bad enough of a rip off for poor students as it is 
 I wouldn't say that the book is wholly without merit, but it left me with an eerie feeling, and a suspicion that it was an advertisement for a certain lifestyle, a cocktail, or god forbid khakis.  It's a shameless embrace of impulsive living, embodied in the stylized way this book is written, and which was eventually Kerouac's undoing.  Is he fleecing the lowlifes he socializes with by writing down their stories?  Is he glorifying, and capitalizing on, disfunction?  It's difficult to answer those questions, but a more meaningful or entertaining book would preclude their asking.  Capote said of Jack Kerouac that he was "typing, not writing."  That may have been unfair, but reading the Subterraneans, I felt I knew where he was coming from.  That said, I kinda liked the ending.  Gosh, I'm a sucker.  
 Castro et al. are to Cuban history what Comrade Stalin and company were to Russian history and Joseph Goebbels and friends were to German history.  The title by itself is laughable.  Who, except for Castro cultists, really thinks that the U.S. military could not have beaten Castro's forces if it had been given the go ahead to do so?  As it was, the defeat of a force of less than 1500 Cuban exiles left stranded by the U.S. on Cuban soil is really a testament to President Kennedy's poor judgement rather than to Communist Cuba's military prowess.  For a truly balanced, historical account of the Bay of Pigs affair, read Peter Wyden's "Bay of Pigs: The Untold Story."  Then, for a study in propagandizing and myth-making, read this book 
 This series may be good for a laugh. Some of the writing is engaging.   But the premise is absurd.   WHY, in this day and age, should anyone accept the world-view of the Bible? A book that tells us to buy and sell slaves, stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe's beliefs, and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of Mt. Sinai?   In a sense, Bible believers have been "left behind" since the 1700s Enlightenment. Tom Paine's "The Age of Reason" showed the God of the Bible to be a cruel, vindictive monster. And what did Thomas Jefferson call the book of Revelations? "The ravings of a madman."   Read this series, if you like. Enjoy parts of it. But make no mistake: to take any of this seriously, you have to regress to a prehistoric world-view, before men learned to think, to ask questions; before logic or science -- a time when dazed, superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth, if they didn't grovel humbly enough to their supposed god.   Do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one? When the "sheep" are raptured up to heaven, their clothes are left behind. So heaven is a nudist colony?   The basic contradiction, of course, lies in using worldly action (some of it exciting) to proselytize for the unworldly, the supernatural.   But why should we care whether any of the "good" guys gets killed? And why should THEY mind -- won't they go straight up to heaven? That's what they WANT, isn't it? Why even lift a finger against the "bad" guys -- didn't Christ say, "Resist not evil"?   Worried about who will win? "God" is infinitely powerful. So Jesus (who is 1/3 of God -- or something like that) is sure to win when Armageddon rolls around, in book 12 of the series. And the "sheep" -- the believers -- will happily worship him, looking just like the pictures of dim-witted, bovine people you see in the tracts Jehovah's Witnesses leave at your door.   The going price for a used copy of "Tribulation Force" is one cent. Does that tell you something?   Actually, the story-telling is worth more. The basic premise is worth less. Perhaps it averages out 
 For those who have never read "new age" mystic like Deepak Chopra or L.Ron Hubbard, or views on the merging of the eastern mystics with christianity, this might seem like a new book. But to most SF (speculative fiction) fans, we've seen this done too many times.   It wouldn't turn a head at the Nebula Awards or even make it as a serial in Fantasy. It's been done so much better by people like Philip K. Dick, Isaac Asimov or Alfred Bester.  OK, what's wrong with it. Stop me if you've heard this one. Well the premise is from Fail Safe or maybe Dr. Strangelove. The out of control super-computer, with the mind of a maniacal would be world dictator. And the US military is out to blow it up before it can saturate the planet with nuclear explosions. But guess what? The computer is on to them...Oh My...Lions tigers and bears OH MY...we're not in Kansas any longer. (Where are the singing Munckins when you need them!)  Whose going to straighten all this out???? Well, Dr.Tennant, that's who...doh ti dah, dotid di dot ti dahhhhh...able to leap all religions in a single bound, more powerful that quantum mechanics...look up in the sky, it's SUPER DOC! or is it DOC the Christ, Jesus, this was ridiculous at some points.  There is a fine line between profound and unfounded, and Iles has done a great job of tripping over the line. I have read other Iles books, notably "24", and found them interesting and well written. But why do I think if this manuscript was submitted under a nom de plume, it would have been laughed at. Probably because it was past plausibility.  Characterization belongs in a cartoon...mean evil general who beats his daughter, daughter who grows up meaner than daddy, frightened Indian neurologist, stylish eccentric englishman, persevering psychiatrist (and jewish to boot), noble palestinians and mosad (israeli) agents. Our hero is more resolute than James Bond, tougher than Jackie Chan, a better shot than a trained sniper, able to survive on land, air and on the sea....oh and don't forget the crazy billionaire computer genius who wants to have himself downloaded into the mega-computer so that he can live for eternity.  One word, UGH. 
 I was looking for a book that was simple, easy, and to the point. This book has WAY too much information; which is often hard to comprehend. Also, the pictures are really out-dated. This book was not helpful for me to learn about sensual massage 
 I think this book is worse than the others written by Savage-Weiner, which is saying a lot. Unfortunately, most reviewers never bothered reading this book.  On page 2, I am reminded why I hate this guy. Observing "while I'm no military tactician," he forgets to point out he was dodging the draft picking flowers in Hawaii while I and others were serving in Vietnam. He then states, "we still had to fight the real war, a guerrilla war--something our nation does not have the stomach for." Oh, please dude, people like you and your followers don't have the guts to serve. Like on page 10, where he forgets that people like Ted Kennedy at least served in the Navy during WWII. You may disagree with his politics, but at least the Kennedys had the guts to serve.  Skip ahead to page 172 (you ain't missing much) for more of his idiocy on Vietnam. He states, about the Vietnamese, that "in the sixties, no one really knew who they were." Well, he didn't, but 3 million Americans who served in the Vietnam War did. That's what happens when you sit out the war of your generation. He also erroneously claims that Vietnam "was a civil war." At the time of the war it was considered communist aggression. Conservatives of the sixties, like me but not him, knew about the communist threat. This is also the same page where Savage-Weiner claims "Iraq was not a civil war." Where have you been lately?  The "Afterword" really says it all. On page 203 he claims, about liberals, "for far too long you have lived in a cage where liberal ideas--and only liberal ideas--are expressed." He is really talking about himself and his followers. At least liberals, by definition, read and review all points.   For all those who hate "liberals," I would like to remind them that our Founding Fathers were the liberals of their day. A real Patriot of our Revolution (one of my real ancestors in Virginia) would have burned his house down and sent him packing on his big honking yacht.   
 Pierre Bourdieu is a tremendous intellect, and has produced far superior  work to this book.  _Distinction_ is a fascinating book, particularly for  those interested in French society.  Yet its relevance cannot really extend  to America, which has a markedly different system of class.  The French  have deeply entrenched class consciousness, in both a pragmatic sense and a  Marxist sense, whereas 90% of Americans consider themselves "middle  class."   	Bourdieu shows that the French are at pains to  symbolically express their class differences, and he does so with aplomb.   He compiles statistics and data which show ways in which the French produce  their own class position through consumption, education, and taste.   	      But his observations are less applicable to the vast American  "middle class."  Class mobility, education, and stylistic  expression are much more democratically distributed in America.  So while  many French are content with their class position, vocation, and  traditions, most Americans see themselves as "middle class,"  striving for better, and free from tradition.   	    _Distinction_ is  an interesting and accesible book, but those looking for Bourdieu's  contributions to social theory will be better served by some of his other  works 
 When you "search inside" the book while still on Amazon before purchasing the PDF of Hegel's _Phenomenology_, you are provided with pages from Miller's translation in the viewer. When one has opened the PDF which one can download upon purchase, however, it is not the Miller translation, but rather an UNATTRIBUTED translation. My goal in purchasing the PDF of the Phenomenology was to use it as a word-search for the actual physical book, a way of finding passages I had read but couldn't remember the location of. It can be used that way, partially, but only indirectly, because it is a different translation--it will only help you find passages in the Miller if Miller happened to have chosen the exact same word(s) as the secret translator of the PDF-version! That's the problem. The translation provided in the PDF will furthermore be difficult to cite, given that NO TRANSLATOR is credited with having brought the 404 pages into English (in addition, no year for the translation is provided either--at any rate, if these attributions are provided in the PDF, they are not easy to find, because I have not found them yet). I also went to digireads.com, which is listed in the PDF as its source, but their listing for the book says nothing about the source of the translation. [After a quick search on the web, it appears the translation is the same as the one provided for free on line on marxists dot org -- click on "reference" and then "hegel" to get a listing of all his works. That translation is listed on that webpage as being the Harper Torchbooks' edition of the Phenomenology, from 1807. 
 We recieved two of these for my daughter's first birthday. She LOVES being in the pool but this float ALMOST changed EVERYTHING!!!! The inner tube sinks underneath the top tube no matter how you try and fix it or blow it up. My daughter FREAKED OUT!!!! She had never been afraid of the water until we put her in this. DO NOT waste your money 
 I was not a huge fan of the first book, but the concept was interesting and some times a series gets better with each book. This may not be the case here. While it is not as forehead smacking dimwitted as the first, it is has it's moments of unbeleiveablity. How can Dexter be so attractive that women throw themselves at him, and such a good pretender of being human that he can be oblivous when women like him? The only women who was not attracted to him has been his foster sister, and I kind of think it might be only a matter of time. I also dislike how every person who is his foe ends up dead or out of commission. Are they going to introduce a new character to be "on to him" every book? This is not only frustrating but it shows that the author is completely incapable of developing any character or relationship longer than a few pages. 
 This movie has some excellent acting, starting with the always wonderful Michael Caine, and some very funny moments, but it lacks one important ingredient: a script.  The story beings promisingly and then just slowly evaporates. Worth watching if you are an inveterate Caine fan or feel nostalgic about that Caribbean island you visited. 
 I believe this book is strictly for scholars and Hindus. It is somewhat dry and unless you have an overwhelming interest in the subject can become quite dull. It does have excellent detail and structure for those interested in the subject but alas I have discovered I am not 
 A first novel--and it shows. Has all the charm of Barbara Pym's best work (Excellent Women, No Fond Return of Love) but is marred by narrative clumsiness and (frankly) lousy technique: characters appear out of nowhere, conversations start one place and end in another, etc. Skip this and focus on her later, great work 
 Since the break up of our 6 year relationship I have purchased many books.  This one was not as helpful as the others because the information was very introductory and not deep enough.  It seemed like the book is saying that God is the answer to saving the marriage.  Maybe true, but I was hoping for  a book with more deep psychological analysis.  I recommend the books  "Letting Go" by Dr. Tracy Cabot, and "Make Up Don't Break  Up" by Dr. Bonnie Eaker Weil 
 First of all I want everyone to notice that this is only VOLUME 2.  Volume one is no longer available anywhere.  Thus, making this book fairly useless.  The only thing that it's really good at it showing different stiles between professional comic book inkers.  It nice to page through and I don't regret buyin it but it is not necessary for an artist's library 
 I agree with the reviewer who called it a "bogus treatise." I read this book after personally witnessing a remote viewing experiment (documented on my website). I did not read the whole book, only chapters 1-7 and 16 (I wasn't interested in debunking Uri Geller). Chapter 3 begins with a Robert Browning quote "...you'll find what you desire", I assume targeted at "believers" in the paranormal. But it equally applies to the authors. In their "replication" of Targ's remote viewing experiments the authors selected as the viewers a few students and a housewife who "believed themselves to be psychic to some degree." Of course, they did not believe in the existence of the phenomena they were testing -- otherwise they might have allowed themselves to make the assumption that it might require someone who practices. If you were testing "exceptional athletic abilities" would you select a subject who played softball once a year and "believed he was athletic to some degree" or would you select a professional athlete?  For remote viewing, you could select members of the Hawaii Remote Viewers' Guild, for example.  Their intent was not to study the phenomena using an open-minded scientific approach, but to "debunk" it - in the typical sarcastic style 
 These types of movies are becoming quite the trend in Hollywood. Fight Club started it (which was an awesome movie). Then the Sixth Sense (which was also pretty good). After that, it all went downhill. The Brown Bunny, The Machinist, The Others, Hide & Seek, etc. Surprise endings with a twist, characters that don't exist that are only in the main characters imagination, daed characters that don't know they are dead. These movies are all about surprising the audience with the already overused plot twists. I predicted that John Torturro's character was a figment of Depp's imagination within the first 20-25 mins of the film. Why would an actor of Depp's status take part in a movie of this substance 
 As a complete newbie to XML this was a good starter.  As I got deeper into XML I found several mistakes/deficiencies in the book, and sometimes the author just flat out seemed to not know what he was talking about.  For instance, the claim on page 86 that (#CDATA) is a valid DTD element content definition is flat out wrong.  His description of Schema element declarations (pp. 114-115) teaches that using globals/refs is the only way to define complex elements, and is inappropriate for his example.  He makes no mention of globals at all, leaving the reader confused.  I have ceased to trust this book as a valid source of XML information 
 Charles Laughton plays the rotund monarch in a role that was highly praised. But it's lumbering and creaky, with heavy-handed theatrics, typical of the early talky era. I found watching this picture very heavy going 
 ...this movie is at the top of my list...unfortunately, it's the 'worst movie of all-time' list...that's right, ladies and gentlemen, friends and supporters of this film...this movie is trash (and not just for cuba's horribly annoying acting)...it's also one of the reasons so many relationships end up miserable...come on...do you really think renee would have ended up with this guy if his career went in the other direction...it was pure desperation rather than inspiration that made him succumb to showing up with his hat in his hands...and if all you base a relationship on, is the end justifying the means, well, i wish you luck with your next soul mate.. 
 Too much verbiage on wandering through the woods; too little information on grizzlies -- although what's there is genuine.  The prose style is typical "American Public Simple," neither intellectually  challenging nor capable of holding the reader's attention.  Too many words  -- at a high school reading level -- and not enough content.  The Vietnam  War flashbacks are largely gratuitous, something to capture the target  audience.  The entire work strikes one as a manufactured product, with  reading level, content, style, and "insight" groomed by the  publisher's editor, not by the author.  A light read, at best, primarily  for urbanites who need to believe there's still a metaphysical 'Wilderness'  out there somewhere, where we can save our collective souls... 
 This is not the Spring-Heeled Jack that jumped really high and spat blue flames in England. Not the evil Spring-Heeled Jack that all of us paranormalists love. They just totally changed Jack's personality! How frustrating 
 In 1990 Bill Bryson set out to "do Europe". He says that his motivation was to relive his experiences from tours in Europe in 1972 and 1973 when he was a young student wandering around Europe with a backpack.  In reality it seems as if the primary reason for Bill Bryson to do this trip was so that he could then write a funny book about the trip.  "Neither Here Nor There" is, in fact, a very funny book, at least in the beginning. Bill Bryson can describe situations in a very humorous way, and he's willing to make fun of himself, as well as everything around him.  Unfortunately, after a while the humor wears thin. Then it wears very thin. Then you begin to dissect the humor, and realize that you've been had.  Bill Bryson's method of traveling is to emulate the kind of tourism we all like to ridicule. He typically arrives by train in a new city in the evening. He has no hotel reservation so he has to spend time finding a hotel that is not really what he wanted. He sees "the sights" that one is supposed to see in that city. He makes no effort to get in touch with the local people, to learn about their lives, or to understand their country and society. He spends typically 2-3 days in each city and then goes to work on figuring out how to get to the next city or country on his list, which often leads to further complications.  This is obviously not the way to travel if you're writing a travel book. Nobody in their right mind would want to read about this kind of traveling.   But Bill Bryson is not writing a travel book, he's writing a funny book, and he has a sure-fire recipe:  1. Do things in problematic ways, and then make fun of all the trials and tribulations that result.  2. Mix in lots of flashbacks to the trips of your youth, with much juvenile humor related to the drives that young men are so driven by.  3. Feign incomprehension about everything foreign and satirize everything that is unfamiliar.  4. Make funny remarks intended to reinforce national prejudices.  This last type of humor can be especially tiring. Here are a few examples to illustrate what I mean:  "Let's face it, the French Army couldn't beat a girls' hockey team." (pg 32)  "The (German) women still don't shave their armpits. ... They all look so beautiful and stylish, and then they lift up their arms and there's a Brillo pad hanging there." (pg 91)  "In Norway, three people and a bottle of beer is a party; in Sweden the national sport is suicide." (pg 97)  "But the most preposterous law of all, a law so pointless as to scamper along the outer reaches of the surreal, is the Swedish one that requires motorists to drive with their headlights on during the daytime." (pg 110)  "I love the way the Italians park. You turn any street corner in Rome and it looks as if you've just missed a parking competition for blind people." (pg 123)  In conclusion, if you're someone who "did Europe" in your youth and you want to relive fond memories in a humorous way, then you may well like this book. Most other readers will probably start out laughing, then smiling, then wondering why the jokes seem to have lost their appeal, and finally ending up wishing they'd picked a real travel book or a real humorous book.  Rennie Petersen  PS. Just for the record, here is a list of the places covered: Norway (Hammerfest, Oslo), France (Paris), Belgium (Brussels, Bruges, Spa, Durbuy), Germany (Aachen, Cologne, Hamburg), Holland (Amsterdam), Denmark (Copenhagen), Sweden (Gothenburg, Stockholm), Italy (Rome, Naples, Sorrento, Capri, Florence, Milan, Como), Switzerland (Brig, Geneva, Bern), Liechtenstein, Austria (Innsbruck, Salzburg, Vienna), Yugoslavia (Split, Sarajevo, Belgrade), Bulgaria (Sofia), Turkey (Istanbul) 
 I did not care for this work about the drarf although I imagine she like so many people who are different had a very difficult time in life the suibject matter was not my cup of tea as to reading material. It's a well written piece of work if you're into dwarfs' life stories 
 Our family bought this tank and we went through plenty of goldfish with it. We stopped buying when our 10 year old was using the scope to look at the fish. She was pulling it up and down and turning it and when she was finished, she put it down and saw that she had put it down on the actual fish. The fish was bleeding and died. The kids were not very happy. I guess this is an okay tank but not great. You might want to put only beta's in it. I would suggest getting something with a filter and heater if you want any other kind of fish 
 Please note that I'm doing a review for the whole series up to now.  The start of Megatokyo was fairly shaky and almost like a rip off of Penny Arcade but with a mixed in running story. It was funny and it was irrelevant. What truly impressed me with Megatokyo was how both creators Fred (the artist) and Rodney (the co writer) worlds/writing would blend together to form a very distinct parody/comedy/story telling style.   I love how contrast of the 2 main characters Piro (the serious and hopeless lover manga archetype) and Largo (the delusional gamer) are able to mix their worlds together so well. My favorite moments in the manga is when Piro talks seriously about his problems with relationships while in the background Largo levels Tokyo with a giant radioactive lizard.  Unfortunately, with the departure of Rodney, most of the magic is gone and the manga has turned into a story driven angst filled anime soap with only few interesting moments in between. The plot keeps going over and over again and it is mentally draining listening to all the angst spewed repeatedly by the main character Piro.   Another sad thing I have noticed in this series, for a NOW story focused comic, pacing is not only slow but there is virtually no character development. The characters stay static and when there are hints they will be use to make the story interesting, Fred drops the ball by using stale old anime story clichés.   I understand that Megatokyo tries to parody anime and manga, and I have no objection to that but how he uses this parodies as a story telling element is poorly done pretty obvious to where he copies most of his ideas (A.I. loves you, love hina etc).  I'm guessing that many of its fans are relative newbies to manga and anime so most of the elements Megatokyo copies from anime and manga are, to them, fresh, new and/or interesting - so I can't really blame them. Of course there is also that otaku fan boy fantasy of going to Tokyo and doing what the main characters have done. It seems Fred has found the jackpot by targeting the right demographic just like what how producers of boy bands target teenyboppers.  Maybe my standards are just a little too high for a webcomic like megatokyo but considering how great its fans make it out to be, you'd think it would be fantastic as sliced apple pie. If you are a veteran of manga and anime, I cannot recommend this series to you but if you are one of those new wide eye anime fans then Megatokyo might appeal to your sense of wonderment about whole new world of Japanese comics and japanimation 
 If you are a picky mom like me...i.e you DO NOT let your child watch "sponge bob" or "Scooby Doo" and you maybe even read Mothering Magazine, DO NOT get this book. I didn't feel the jokes were appropriate, I guess I am a bit of a nerd about these things. It isn't funny to have a headless man poor beer/ale down the "hole" in his neck. They discussed murdering Shrek (hey leap pad, not age appropriate!!!!), and I didn't like to see "human" Shrek in chains fighting to get free (nor did my son). They have "ugly" phrases that could have been more kid friendly, my son pointed out the ugly phrases, and snarled his nose at them saying "Mom, that was UGLY!". I was dissappointed with this book, and I am taking mine back to the store. I really like the leap frog system, even though I don't normally buy toys that require batteries...i.e the toys do something for the kid, instead I normally buy "old fashioned" natural toys where my son has to make the toys do stuff (blocks, leggos etc) BUT I REALLY love this system. It is a treat for my son to have an electronic toy so he really gets into Playing it and of course "accidently" learning. I also didn't like the Hop on Pop leap book for similar reasons, even though the Dr. Suess part was great, the leap pad people added unneeded "ugly" phrases again that were just NOT age appropriate. Although I did like the minimal writing on most of the Dr. Suess pages. I do like the regular "Leap" ones...moss lake etc, and the honey pot one with pooh bear. Sorry to be so picky, if you are not picky you will probly like this book.  
 Maxwell's concepts of what a leader is is quite accurate.  However, I don't think he needed to spend over 200 pages to define what a leader is.  That's what this book came to be: one long, repetitive, obvious definition for leadership.  I didn't see these as laws so much as nuances of what he'd already said.  As a woman, reading this book was made more difficult with his overwhelming use of sports and male leaders.  The few examples he uses of female leaders are the few and the cliched (ex., Mother Teresa and Princess Diana).  A nun and a princess.  How many women in business are either of those?  Where are the examples strong, successful, inspiring female business and sports leaders?  I also found his use of his religious roles and examples tiresome.  What I felt that this book lacked most was more suggestions to improve one's leadership skills?  He suggests training, but not what kind nor does he provide exercises for developing oneself as a leader.  Another failure of this book is how he rarely addresses how a strong leader should deal with situations that aren't going well.  A great leader's abilities are best exemplified and most apparent in times of conflict.  I also strongly disagree that a positional leader isn't necessarily a true leader.  A positional leader is in nature a leadership role.  What isn't inherent in a positional leader is her or his ability to lead *well*?  One of the elements of this book I did appreciate were the pictures and quotes and the fact that the book is a quick read.  Other than that, I don't feel any more prepared now than I did prior to reading this book 
 I liked this book at first, it had an interesting group of characters, a solid voice and good potential for conflict. Unfortunately, it took a terrible turn after the first one hundred pages and I ended up hating it.   At it's worst it's teeming with stereotypes and ridiculous dialogue. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes. The gay husband is ridiculous. The white deaf old lady and her black housekeeper who is her best friend? Ridiculous. You've seen it all before and, trust me, you probably didn't like it the first time.   It didn't feel like the author really understood her characters because they were constantly disregarding themselves. Frannie says in one breath that she hates Arthur and wouldn't call him until her fingers rotted and in the next breath is urging Anna to sleep with him. It made the characters seem inauthentic.  What conflict there was in the beginning falls into boring retelling. It should be a drinking game how many time Anna tells her gay ex-husband that she loves him and vice versa. It was just played out. Boring. Overdone in all the wrong places, underdone in all the rest. Very disappointing 
 When I first learned about this book I was so excited.  I had just started gripping on feature films and I thought I would be able to pick up some tips.  Sadly, while Mr. Uva has been Key Gripping for years, he fails to  provide true insight.   While this book is great for people who have never  worked with film equipment, at 30 clams, I regret the purchase. If you have  gripped before, I would pass on this one 
 I so do not understand all the rave reviews on this book. I read it recently for a book club selection, and let me tell you, If I didn't have to read it, I would have put it down after the first twenty pages, and never picked it up again. I found it to be dark, depraved, disgusting, and depressing! An examination of love in all it forms? Hardly! These characters were just plain goofy. I finally figured it out towards the end of the book, these characters were so miserable because they were lost spiritually. They were looking to other humans to provide them with true love, and that is just barking up the wrong tree. I am giving it one star only for the rich use of language 
 Badly written book 
      Stellar performances by all actors and actresses involved in this movie are ruined by the sheer ignorance of the topic. Not one single "fact" about guns contained in this movie was true and at the end of the film I had nothing but an overwhelming feeling that the bad guys had clearly won. What a crock 
 My daughter loves it.  You wants to practice more often now.  Thank 
 The History channel should be ashamed of this effort.  I have seen the PBS broadcasts and indeed the original broadcasts on NBC in the 50"s  All were quality B&W films.   This DVD has, aside from the audio problems mentioned in other reviews,  has muddy, low contrast, all gray images commensurate with 10th generation dubs. Viewing and listening are an unpleasant experience 
 As someone doing serious searching as to where to move in New England, I expected more from this book's title as it had promised.  Too often, I found the information too general and not specific.  For example, coming from "the highest car insurance rates in the country" NJ, I wanted to know how Maine's insurance costs ranked as a basic cost of living.  Insurance costs -- auto or health -- were not discussed. Duh! Real estate?  How about housing costs by county or community?  Not in this book. What are average utility costs? What are Maine winters really like?  In brief, you will not find the serious information in this book you need to make an informed decision about moving to Maine. Frankly, I'm having a hard time locating any definitive guidebook about living in Maine -- what about the subject of reliable heating -- what do residents do when power goes out? -- and will likely have to do my own laborous search through various sources -- to pull together all information I need.  I really tire of purchasing books that don't deliver on their titles.  This title -- does not deliver 
 The Decemberists are wonderful performance art, an exercise in demonstrating just how gullible the indie crowd really is. Will they swallow a precious, pretentious, pseudo-english, neo-prog, ren-faire-reject band that delivers lines like "Meet me on my vast veranda / my sweet untouched Miranda / And while the seagulls are crying / we fall but our souls are flying" with perfectly nasal ernestness?  Will they ever.  It's a 5 star practical joke, making up in success what it lacks in subtlety. But if you buy it, the joke's on you 
 Unfortunately, I am beginning to see the results of Miss Liedloff's views on raising children in my grandchildren. I feel sorry for them.  Miss Liedloff was ashamed to admit to the Indians in South America that where she comes from 'women do not feel capable of raising children until they read the instructions written in a book by a strange man.' She does, however, want you to accept the views of a strange woman who has never had children and whose only direct experience comes from 'parenting' an anteater(!) and allowing a small monkey to sleep with her. She assumes that her views derived from analyzing mentally disturbed patients can be applied to all mothers in this country.   Modestly, she lets us know that Dior wanted her to model - but she refused, although Vogue also managed to snag her for a short period. The idea of the 'jungle' fascinated her, and when she arrived in South America she observed a perfect, primitive society not as an anthropologist, but rather as an impressionable tourist. In this perfect society when things go wrong people laugh. The only people who cause problems are those who stupidly have left the tribe and have had contact with civilization. Unfortunately, they even learn a few words of Spanish. Children, even when they are old enough only to crawl, understand danger and do not need supervision.   Miss Liedloff knows why people take drugs, what causes homosexuality, and of course how to raise children.  Please look elsewhere on how to raise children 
 I bought this because I'm about 25 miles from the OTA HD stations.  Tried several different mounting positions and couldn't pick up more than one station at a time, none of which had a very strong signal.  After two days of working with the Terk, I picked up a $30 indoor antenna - set it up in the attic and picked up 4 channels with mid-level strength.  Returned the Terk the next day.  May work fine in some areas, but I would try the $30 solution first 
 I had to return this.  The poetry in the book was very nice, but the pictures were too abstract I think for a preschooler to grasp, and not particularly compelling for me as an adult who not only uses preschool nature books professionally but also collects them as a hobby.  
 I recently purchased this booster as well as the Britax Starriser booster seat (I have two cars/two toddlers and an infant).  My children argue over who gets to ride in the Starriser.  For some reason they are not as comfortable in the Parkway.  My theory is that it is too much like a car seat rather than a booster -- and they feel "too snug" in it.  They even look uncomfortable in it. The one advantage of the Parkway over the Starriser is the increase neck protection if they should fall asleep.  If I had to do it over, I would have purchased two of the Starrisers instead of the Parkway. BTW, I purchased the Britax Companion for my infant and I LOVE it 
 This movie is typical Hollywood anti-war, anti-military, anti-American trash.  The "show biz" liberals, aided and abetted by their ideological cousins, the left-wing TV news moguls, have always sought to portray American soldiers in Viet Nam as baby-killing, drug-crazed monsters.  This movie is typical of that ilk. If you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war, buy the DVD of "We Were Soldiers."--a much better, and far more honest, film 
 Vulgar, sloppy Donal Loge (last seen as complainer in Mel Gibson's film 'The Pa- triot', plays stoner and womanizing slouch,  who happens to be kindergarten teacher (!!),  who gets wake up call while trying to charm  the pants (literally) off John Goodman's real  life wife! He meets his match and learns a few  things along the way. All-American Steve's get looked up to in here; especially Steve McGar- rett! Horay for that, otherwise this sort of dull film would get two star rating from moi 
 They wouldn't let me give a review of 0 so a gave it one star. The film is broken up into five sections, for five different time periods, but none of them have any substance to them. There is a reason that this film was  smashed pretty hard when it was released. I'll watch pretty much anything,  but this remains the only movie that I've ever walked out of. I later  watched it again with a friend to prove that Williams really did a film  this bad, and it was worse the second time around. There is no reaseon to  see this film. If you looking for a good Williams picture, get "dead  poets. . " or "Good Will. . ." or even "What dreams[the  book is better though]."      This film is terrible, but not bad  enough to justify being watched to mock, such as "attack of the  killer..." or "THe Starfighters." There really is no reason  to see this film 
 Dr. Steven Greer is a well-known figure on the fringe of UFOlogy, and he claims to have "briefed" senior government figures on the UFO issue, but five minutes with this book reveals why few take the issue seriously.  It's an amateurish, sometimes incoherent clip job of unedited, free-flowing interviews with dozens of scientists, pilots and former government/military figures, most of whom say they experienced a highly strange UFO episode (though some of the "testimony" is second-hand).   The firsthand stories can be very interesting and provocative, especially when they purport to cover the government's secrecy, suppression and disinformation techniques. But any impact the content might have is pretty much overshadowed by the hard fact that "Disclosure" is a disorganized, misspelled, contradictory, somrtimes unintelligible, incoherent mess. It's not even "written" in the strict sense -- it appears to be a bunch of interview transcripts hurriedly set in type, not subjected to so much as a simple spell-checker. Names and geographic locations are mangled, punctuation is absent, and the speakers' weird allusions are left hanging. It's hundreds of pages long, but it feels like the world's biggest high school social studies project.   The one consistent stylistic point is that Dr. Greer's name or initials appear over and over and over again -- nobody ever accused him of missing self-promotion opportunities -- but the amateurish nature of the production is a net negative mark against him. It's a mess.  In a foreword Greer says the material was/is so urgent, because it deals with the future of the entire human race, etc., that it had to be rushed into publication. I would like to think the definitive word on the future of the entire human race will be spelled right and look like it came from grown-ups.  Tragically disorganized efforts like "Disclosure" warm the hearts of the disinformation masters, I'm sure, because the UFO movement hangs itself with this kind of stuff -- or at least consigns itself to eternal fringe status. It's a serious subject and it deserves serious coverage, but "Disclosure," for all the nuggets of interest it contains, helps guarantee that the subject won't be taken seriously for the foreseeable future.   
 I have read every one of Stephen King's books.  This was the only one that I have not read.  I have struggled to get to page 105 and I have no clue as to what is going one.  The style of Peter Straub stinks.  Don't waste your money, you will put this book back on the shelf an never have a clue as to what the story is about.  Stephen King has finally written a real clunker.  This may be the worst book that I have ever tried to read 
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 My beef with this book is that out of the 216 pages, only about 90 pages actually deal with integrating Access and Excel (or vice versa).  I'm not sure what the author was trying to do here, but most of the book focuses in on using Excel VBA to do various things such as link to SQL server data, automate Word, automate Outlook, and some other things. He spends a little time on the Access perspective, but nothing meaningful.  Frankly this book reads like a collection of code snippets that are vaguely related to data processing. This is a brave attempt at something that has never been done, but this short book falls short of the goal espoused in the title.    P.S.  For any O'Reilly reps reading this, $40 is alot to ask for when you're talking about a 200 page book; especially when you're talking about code that can be gathered on the net for free. tisk...tisk     
 I agree with the other review.  I love the tag-free feeling, but that was about all I liked about this bra.  The fabric seems really cheap.  After maybe 6 washings, my Barely There CC Tagfree was feeling flimsy, and the fabric on the outside of the cups started to pill.  For what they charge for even basic bras these days, I definitely expect them to stay in decent shape for longer than a couple months!  I would not buy another one of these unless they significantly improved the fabric. 
 This author was so full of himself that he had to write a book about it. Here it is.  "Nobel Prize Nominee" alone, is a real good look into the mind of this author. It's nothing more than words. Anyone can be nominated for anything with the Nobel recognitions. Looks good. Sounds Good. But does not require merit or depth to be nominated.  Just like the author. 
 The book is nothing more than a large ego trip from one of the most vile man in politics. Limbaugh has recycled his on air rant and raves into text.  There is nothing new here.  How a failed top forty DJ becomes the mouth piece for the republican party speaks a lot about conservatives.  Treat yourself to Viagra instead.  
 This is another wierd book by Shirley MacLaine: it is neither interesting nor a helpful guide book for pilgrims. The book is just a long rambling new age rant, published because the auther is "Shirley MacLaine".  Too bad really. Don't waste your money on this one. 
 The content of this book should have been the informercial for this book.  Although I understand the need for self promotion.....this book goes way overboard. Everything has been said before and at the end you feel like this book was geared for these two mens' fans and not people who are really looking for ways and means to get out of the rat race.  Hey Robert! We know about your other books and your game.  Donald, we know about your show.  Its great that those things made you rich but we want books with less fluff and less talk about your crap!!!! Honestly, if you havent been living under a rock for the last ten years, this book is a BIG waste of time and money!! 
 I had one of the originals...with the vaneer look.  --Ugly yes, but it was actually very sturdy & well made.  Unfortunately, it got lost in a move.  Then I purchased the newer one.  It just wasn't as good of quality & the latch section cracked on me on the fourth or fifth use!  Garbage!  Pay more $ on a Cuisenart or Delongi...you'll be happier.   
 Whenever Clint Willis finally gets around to compiling a book about hating Saddam Hussein and Osama bin-Laden, then Clint and his cronies might have some credibility. As it is, their blind hatred and knee-jerk reactionary attitudes against Conservatives have produced reams of commentary...loopy, mean-spirited, small-minded ideas that are fundamentally wrong about nearly everything in the world. These pundits' loathing of Conservatism has blinded them against the real enemies of America and freedom. Ironically, it's the Conservatives who provide the strength, vision, and courage to defend the rights of Liberals to spew their opinions. Hatred...that's what this book is. At least truth in advertising is in effect here. 
 Unfortunately this book reads like a sereis of incomplete notes for two or more books that was hastily joined up into one novel.   There are repeated jumps in time that are explained but are still so disorienting that they distract you from what is taking place as you read the book. Niven's usual detailed depiction of the alien or foreign is almost completely absent from this work, and the reader spends much of his or her time re-reading to try and figure out if they missed a page by accident.  The treatment of the primary personas in the book is almost offhandedly shabby.   Louis Wu, the longtime main hero of the series is swep along with the story rather than being the guide for the reader that he had been up until this book. He is constantly distracted by self doubt, lament over Teela Brown, and his desire to bone anyone he meets.  Chmee: Pretty much absent. His one appearance late in the book is exempt of flavor.  Hindmost: bleh. This one has been one-note since the first appearance. Typical Puppeteer "I'm scared! But I can be manipulated int doing scary stuff."  Chmee's son "Acolyte": starts out as an interesting persona in the first 1/3rd of the book, but becomes just a minor note lost in the confusion of the jumpled plotline.  Tunesmith (the Ghoul Protector): Banal. While he shows some potential to live up the the Brennan monster, the original sentient Protector from the novel "Protector", he ends up being not much more than a step ladder.  The new characters in this novel are:  Roxanny: An ARM agent, crashed on the surface of the ring. Dick-fodder for Wu, and other male characters. The dynamic between her and Wu has moments but they are never adequately explored.  Wembleth: A "native" of the ring. A plot-point involving this guy is one of the only interesting ones in the book, sadly it is explored and dropped in about two pages.  An actual Pak Protector: Who is so uninteresting that even though I finished the book last night I already forgot her name.   This book had so much potential, with the introduction of an original Pak I would have loved to learn more about them and the origins of the ring, but all of that is glossed over.  Fortunately the hardover was very cheap an I'm a Amazon Prime member so shipping was free.  Summary: Worth reading if you have read the previous three and can get it cheaply enough. Not a good intro to Niven, who is usually so much better than this 
 Let any man who understands know that this name "Maitreya" is the sum of 666. This being is none other that the Light Bearer-The Bright Morning Star-THE FALLEN ONE...LUCIFER. Woe unto the inhabitants of the earth, for the beast has come down to you as a Lion, seeking whomever he may devour--Revelations. There is only ONE Christ. He was the ONLY son of God Yehovah. For God so loved the world, that he gave his ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, so that who so ever shall believe in him shall not parish but have everlasting life--John 3:16 "Beware, for many will come saying here is the Christ, or I am the Christ...they will come as wolves in sheep's clothing"--Lucifer will claim to be the Christ!. Do not be deceived...For The one and only Christ-JESUS-said in Matthew "There shall rise false Christs, who shall show great signs and wonders...he shall deceive even the elect." Maitreya who promises us something that he cannot give, has only one agenda...to destroy the human race. Christ will indeed return to earth after 7 years of Maitreya's rule. This time will be known as the Tribulation. This Tribulation's beginning will be marked by Maitreya's 7 year agreement w/ Isreal. This agreement, like all promises made by the Father of Lies, will be broken. There is no "Godhood" for any of us. This same thing was promised to Eve in the Garden... "for you will know the difference between good and evil and be as Gods" The real reward for this trespass against God (as Lucifer knew it would be according to eternal law) was seperation from God and the beginning of suffering. "And take heed to yourselves, lest anytime your heart be overcharged [with the cares of this life ] so that the day will come upon you unawares" Luke 21-34   The time is soon now, very soon. God Speed in these last days. This life is nothing in the scheme of things. God Speed in these last days. 
 Very boring reading.  Chapters tend to repeat themselves.  The class I had for this book was one of the most boring classes I ever had.  Instructor lectured from power point slides.  I could have taken this class homestudy and done just fine, than to sit in class 
 Our hero,amoral in his love life, refusing to kick his unfaithful ex-wife to the curb, and making mystery solving boring, why continue? Parker can write like no one else, but his recent plots suggest the well may be dry 
 I loved Mortal Kombat,and I thought the sequel would carry on the great Kombat legacy.I was heartily dissapointed when I saw annihilation.Brian Johnson was cool as Khan,but some of the special effects were so fake I had to laugh.Robin Shou returns as Liu Kang,the savior of Earth.After killing Shang Tsung,the group heads on home when all of a sudden,the Emperor busts up the party and sends his minions down.There,Khan makes his first appearance,along with his abnormal,yet awesome soldiers.Johnny Cage is killed,and Rayden(now played by James Remar)fights Khan,winning but sacrificing Johnny Cage.Now,Earth has seven days before it's destroyed.What I didn't like about this movie was appearances by people who had died in the first film,like Scorpion and Sub-zero.Who heard of Sub-Zero having a brother.Another thing that got me was how Liu Kang's fighting got worse since the first film.He was losing every battle,except the end,and even then he wasl osing.Do not get this film if you want to avoid dissapointment 
 If you are looking for a good movie to buy for your child, pass on this one. This movie has so many drug references, i can't even begin to explain.(trust me, I just so happen to have taken acid before) This is a movie that NEVER should have been directed toward children.        If you want your child to be drug free when he/she grows up, do not buy this 
 This pair clearly knows what they are doing, but who in their right mind would spend millions to live in a bad derivative of Dorothy Draper and Sister Parrish? Their use of clashing patterns and brilliant color is one step away from a nervous breakdown. In a vigilent attempt to get press (and boy have they), they have masterminded an attention getting style that has kept them on the forefront of shelter magazines for two decades, yet they are clearly the laughing stock of thier peers. Pity they could not do something original AND liveable. Now that would have been brilliant 
 The book is a compilation of poorly-researched essays, really poorly done,  each belaboring bellyache ideas that we all, quite frankly, grew tired of back in high school. Example...the ridiculous diatribe into 'who is and who is not a native'. Haven't we all grown sick of that racist measuring stick yet?    Unfortunately, each essay follows the same tired format.  All are made up of stereotypes, promoting such yowlers as 'all Whites think this way,  vs. all indigenous people think that way...'; drawn-out complaints without substantiation, such as 'all non-native professors use gatekeeping to keep out indigenous scholars', and the like.    The book is for truly hateful, bigoted people who wish to foster an environment of fear in the academy and for those interested in engaging in senseless, time-wasting, essentialist arguments.    Save your money and time and work for justice 
 Unless you like laughing at other people's lack of intelligence and compassion, this book is not for you. It's absolutely ridiculous how these women act. I don't think they understand what elegance and decorum is about... Much like a person who follows a rule without understanding its purpose. 
 The publishers should be sued. Maybe we should get a class-action together.  Imagine taking an instruction manual for the very first Apple computer and putting a new title on it "How to use your new home computer" and selling it in bookstores today. This book is doing EXACTLY that!  Also, it is highly doubtful that the tactic ever worked in the first place. The author's website vanished years ago. In a thinly traded NYSE stock if you try to repeatedly front the specialist with 2000 share orders he will simply move the price 50 cents against you immediately following your next purchase. Game over.  [... 
 steer clear.  This movie suffers from terminal SCS... Shaky Camera Syndrome, the latest thing nowadays to make a movie look cool.  Not only does that leave you disturbed physically, but it distracts you from what could be crucial elements of the story, such as Giovanni Ribisi's family history, which they also manage to screw up, leaving you really not caring if he wins or loses in the end.  Pile on top of that the awful acting and the extremely poor casting choices of Ben Affleck and Vin Diesel, and you have a waste of time.  As for Giovanni Ribisi, he's ok in this movie, but go buy/rent Heaven with him and Cate Blanchett 
 It is always amusing for me to come across  yet another attempt at "Revisionist Koresh History". In this book the author tries to portray David Koresh as a misunderstood religious leader instead of being the evil sociopath that he truly was.The author attempts to give the reader the "Human side" of Koresh's followers.What he fails to describe that it was all a case of "David , please take my wife and daughter, kindly plunder my Bank Account and that way we won't have to think for ourselves anymore".The author glosses over the numerous Charges of Child Abuse while ignoring the fact that Koresh kept the children for 51 days in a hostile environment where there was no running water, electricy, heat or even decent food. As a negotiator with David Koresh the author failed miserably in respect to not getting the innocent children out of harm's way into the  care of the proper authorities where they could be given a hot meal, a warm bed and a safe place to live far away from conflict and gunfire.The author tries to show the real humanity of those involved and fails because there was no Humanity in that Compound only a thug who hide behind women and innocent hildren and interpreted the Bible through the barrel of a gun 
 First of all, everyone is entitled to their opinion.  While I respect everyones take on this album, I am amazed by how varied our tastes are and by how much we vary on this album.  Frankly, I didn't care for this album at all.  The songs do not match the singers - with few exceptions.  Angie Stone sounded great and Fantasia was good.  I will say that my favorite song and rendition on this album was Celine Dion's.  Yes, I am a fan of hers but I can be impartial.  Her voice and style blended perfectly with the emotion of the song.  Maybe because she lost her father and can show the emotional range required to be able to sing it.  No one can sing it like Luther but Celine came close.  Luther had a rare talent and the music industry will suffer for this loss.  Overall, you can skip the album and just preview the songs and buy your favorites individually. 
 The story itself is fairly benign, but when you have to start explaining the what, why, and wherefore of spin-the-bottle to your 4-year-old, things get a little sticky. Why would the author and publisher want to insert such content--which would resonate more with the 12-14 year-old crowd--into a book for 4-8 year olds? Also, it reduces a wonderful boy-girl friendship into the "standard" sexual attraction relationship. There's enough of that on TV geared toward young kids. Why not let them enjoy simple sincere friendships for another few blissful years 
 As part of a book club, I forced myself to read this book to the end.  It was so boring and drawn out.  I would speed read/skip to look for any interesting sections.  I personally found his descriptions of sex/romance practically repulsive.  I haven't read a male author in awhile.  It was a turn off 
 Lets starting boycotting TV series to DVD box set, from Universal/MCA, they are the only ones, that charges the highest price. The 1st season of McCloud, was originally televised, six -60 min. episodes, instead, Universal give three - 90 min. episodes, in which 30 min. is missing from each of those episodes. Also Universal/MCA, don't provide the original music in their box sets, so maybe if sales drop, they will start providing the episodes uncut, with the original music, instead of the cheap substitute music and cut episodes, they give us now!  1st Season 1970 (part of Four-in-One)    1- 1     183A    16 Sep 70   Man from Taos (1) (orig Who Says You Can't Make Friends in New York City?)

 Stephanie Coontz, "scholar" at prestigious Evergreen State College, has delivered yet one more broadside against reason and intellectual honesty. One need not spend time dismantling the arguments of those who find her work fair and balanced - propagandists have always had their supporters. Suffice it to say that this is characteristic of what passes for "scholarship" at today's college, which is to say, it is simply awful. Coontz relies entirely on whatever meager evidence she can muster supporting her premise, while totally ignoring any and all evidence to the contrary. In this case, that contrary evidence is massively overwhelming - but no matter - the end justifies the means. Tripe 
 Simple as that, it doesn't work. Well let's put it this way, it works as well as a pair of x-ray specs. I weep for the poor children whose dreams will be dashed by this 
 I was attracted to the Thermoskin product because it looked more comfortable than rigid splints for night wear, and because Thermoskin advertised that it could be worn while sitting during the day.  The product indeed has a clever-seeming design, and it is well manufactured.    But ultimately, this product seems to me to be too floppy and unstable to consistently stretch out the area of the foot that FEELS to me like it needs to be stretched. (I.e., the area along the sole of my foot that I can feel stretching out in the mornings when, before getting out of bed and while sitting up in it, I press my toes hard against a looped cord or towel; that stretch significantly diminishes my pain upon standing up out of bed.)  The velcro fastenings are indeed secure, but the product's sock-like sleeve and ankle cuff move around some even when the straps are cinched down as tight as they'll go; as a result, what feels like an appropriate stretch typically disappears in about five or ten minutes of normal movement and friction in bed while lying down.  Worse, the angle created by pulling the strap up through the buckle in front of the lower leg just doesn't create the proper stretch; instead it just makes my toes feel crampy.  I'm going to try a rigid split, which may be less comfortable.  But I believe that I need to be strapped into something that consistently maintains a proper angle, which the Thermoskin product doesn't.  And I'd rather incur some discomfort, if it will actually help me get well, than continue to use this not too uncomfortable (but ineffective) product from Thermoskin.    Perhaps others have had or will have better results with it than I have had; and I have no medical training nor deep insight into the anatomy or physiology beyond what I've read on the internet, so consider this to be very much a layman's review.  I've been suffering from plantar faciitis now for about four to five months with little improvement, and I can't compare this product to others that I hope might be more effective.    But I was very disappointed in this product, and regret having spent the money for it 
 Awful game. Nothing like the show. The only way we could try to make it work was to have both teams answer each round and just see who scored the most points. They must pay people to write some of those 5 star reviews. I doubt my family will ever play this game again. Boring 
 There is some info in this book I haven't seen elsewhere about the sources for these luxury fibers, their history and care, etc.  This part of the book reads like a travelog, with nice pictures of goats on the steppes and silkworms.  The author has strong opinions about what brands of yarn you should buy, and coindentally, they are all sold at her shop.  But people don't buy books like this for the history lesson.  They want good patterns.  These patterns are a joke.  At least, I think they are a joke: with this style of photography, you can see every eyelash on the model, but you can't see more than six inches of the garment.  For expensive yarns like this, you want either classic styles that flatter, or interesting knitting, or both.  Here you get neither.  Garter stitch pillows.  Yawn.  And do you really want to invest in 23 balls of Italian cashmere yarn to make a plain stockinette stitch poncho accented with MINK???  I like to splurge on luxury yarns from time to time, but I won't be making any of this stuff 
 Being a dog lover and a lover of literature I was thrilled when I found this book on the store shelf.  A quick look at the list of authors and the cover illustrations and I was thinking what a find.  This book boasts that it's "for lovers of good fiction - with a healthy side interest in dogs".  This sounded perfect for me.  I was very disappointed reading this book.  I found a number of the stories to be uninteresting and I felt a few were very poorly written.  While I will admit that a few (and I mean a very few) of the short stories were good the majority of them were appalling to any dog lover that I know and many of them had nothing but a brief mention of a dog in them.  It truly is not a book for dog lovers or even remote animal lovers.  If I had known what this book was really about, I wouldn't have spent my hard earned money on it and would urge others not to bother.  Borrow someone else's copy or see if the local library has a copy but don't spend your money in hopes of some good dog stories because you won't find them in this book.  As for the literary value of this book, it might be more highly respected if it wasn't so misrepresented and marketed to dog or animal lovers but I doubt it. 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 But at least it's entertaining. This is the story of a typically dull V.C. Andrews-type heroine who lives with her gorgeous mother, handsome, overprotective father, bitter aunt and evil cousin in a victorian mansion somewhere in the south. The aunt and mother drink tea all day, the father spends most of his time at his job, and Audrina plays with paper dolls while cousin Vera torments her and masturbates while reading romance novels. A long time ago, Audrina's perfect, beautiful sister was raped and killed. Since then, her parents have devoted thier lives to protecting Audrina from the outside world. One day, Audrina wanders outside and meets a boy named Arden and his mother, Billie, who live in a cabin behind her. They become friends, and Audrina starts sneaking outside to see him. Daminan, the father, soon catches her, and is angry at first, but after meeting the boy, lets the friendship continue. Audrina's life changes from there. Tragedy and romance ensue. As the title suggests, this is one of the worst books I've ever read. The story does not contain one shred of plausibility. It also suffers from dull, unlikeable charectors, just like Flowers in The Attic did. You know things are bad when your rooting for the evil cousin. Audrina is so beautiful, perfect and inncocent and most off all flat that you can't stand her. Arden came off as being just as annoyingly perfect. Things start off very slowly, with mainly descriptions of the charectors, "creepy" mansion and the tragedy of the death of the "first" Audrina and Damians obsession over it biding our time before something finally happens. Things start rolling once the mother dies, and I admit that I couldn't put it down after this heartbreaking development, even though I was able to predict nearly every twist it had to offer. The book jacket plays up on the whole idea of Damian wanting to turn Audrina into her dead sister, and generally makes it seem likes its going to be alot more creepy than it really is. This wanting-to-turn-Audrina-into-her-dead-sister horror story-type thing only takes up a short amount of the book in the beginning. The rest of the story is a rather average, though addictive family & romance drama. I reccomend it if you want a entertaining, trashy drama/romance novel tinged with mystery and horror and charectors you love to hate. 
 In the photo section there are few too many pictures of movie and tv actors supposed to represent italians. These are mixed in with photos of real Italians. This mix is a little uneven. Also, there are DNA tests now and can be found in books like Spencer Wells's fine Journey of Man book that demonstrate that all Europeans are somewhat neolithically syrian descended (even British Europeans). The author who recently wrote this book could have used these dna studies to illustrate the actual oneness of europeans in having mediteranean ancestry as opposed to the ratty bigotry between supposed southern and northern european groups back in the 18- and early 1900's. But he fails to do so. Some of the Italian history is familiar (like about Garibaldi) but even where it is there are lesser known twists provided. I'd give it two and a half stars if I could 
 I am a 76-year-old Jew who grew up in East Baltimore, surrounded by Eastern European Jewish immigrants.  Avalon depicted almost none of the typically Jewish experiences I recall from my youth:  the seder at my great grandfather's table, the after school lessons at the Baltimore Talmud Torah, Yum Kipur services at the synagogue just up Baltimore Street from by grandmother's house, my bar mitzvah, etc., etc.  Where was the Jewishness I expected to see?  Not in this noisy, confusing chazerai

 This woman's book is an embarassment and she is a self deluded human torturer.  Anyone who likes this book is an idiot and millions of humans are embarassed by her.  She has not treated humans with the respect they deserve.  She try to tell you how dangerous she is and then she proceeds to intrude on my space and humiliate me really -- treat me with massive insensitivity. I won't be surprises if she comes to grief.  I hope your carry your book in you pocket, and stingray stabs you right through your book, into your heart.  Overall I found the book poorly written, half baked, and non sensical 
 As a lifelong fan of this program, I was sorely disappointed to find that Sony did not actually "restore" the film as claimed. The film print used for the video transfer is scratched and filled with specs, "fuzz" etc. As many other reviewers have noted, the soundrack is nothing to write home about, either. Truly, you are better off getting an old used VHS version of the program, as the "bonus" features of this DVD re-release are insignificant (no "making of" features, interviews, or anything like that).  Surely a program this beloved deserves an actual restoration using the original source materials (if they exist) for both film and soundtrack 
 Firstly, I would warn self-publishers that this book is not intended for you. This book is a guide to working WITH a publicist. If you can afford such an expense then proceed to purchase, but most self-publishers are not in that boat (yacht).  Secondly, I took issue with the author's promotion of manipulating Amazon feedback through recruiting as many friends and family as possible to give 5 star reviews. It is because of this abuse of Amazon feedback that I gloss over the positive feed back and read the one and two star reviews to get to the ugly truth. Sometimes these low ratings are baseless; most times they are credible critiques.  Lastly, if you want to get an idea for the REAL value of a non-fiction book, take a gander at the number of USED copies available and the lowest asking price. If published within the last 5 years and still relevant to its topic, a truly valuable book tends to stay within $3 to $5 of the Amazon price and if recently published, won't have an excessive amount of used books available. A better alternative to this book (that would be valuable to self-published and traditionally published alike) is The Complete Guide to Book Marketing by David Cole 
 Full of completely illogical statements. The author seems to have just made up her diagnosis of the major diseases covered, as the diagnoses are highly unlikely and it seems that the author just made them up as she went along. Wow. Unfortunately the lowest score Amazon allowed me to set was 1. This book is not suitable for people of any age unless they are accustomed to chronic lies. Enjo 
 I am now on my second G5 gaming mouse.  It is not the Battlefield 2142 model with the graphics but still the same mouse.  The first one refused to work out of the box.  I spent hours online researching the problem.  I found another computer to test it on and also another mouse to verify my USB ports were working OK on my computer.  I finally took it back and got an exchange.  The second one worked for all of two weeks and then went dead.  It lights up like the first one but will not move the pointer.  I would not recommend this mouse to anyone unless they are willing to spend the time and hassle to buy then take it back for a full refund.  I am sure it must work for some but two in a row is a record for me.  It does feel and operate very well when it works although I did not get a chance to play with different configurations of weights.  The weights seem more like a gimmick to me but I could be convinced with experience and feedback from other users

 Writer trying to find a public When I bought Rome from the ground up I had no idea what to expect, thinking it was perhaps something along the line of Krautheimers Profile of a city (which by the way is mentioned in the bibliograpy of the book), showing the many layers of which Rome exists and the city's long and complicated history. Just to illustrate what I mean: if you are standing in the Forum and looking at the eight surviving columns of the temple of Saturn, it would be just as easy to write ten pages about what you are seeing, as ten pages about what you are not seeing. Doing both would be quite a job. Krautheimer describes the period from 312 till 1308, skipping republic and large part of imperial Rome, and has, in my first edition, 360 very large, double columned and small lettered pages.  But Rome from the ground up is not that sort of book. Thank God, some readers will say. You' ll find that out just by taking it in your hands. The book has 320 small pages with lots of margin, small pictures, and no maps. It is organised in 8 chronological chapters, beginning with Tiber Island and Forum Boarium, than the Forum, next the imperial part of the city and so on, ending in the 19th century really. The idea of the structure is that in this way you get an chronological overview of the city, of which different parts were indeed built in different and succeeding periods. Every chapter could be a walk, or part of it. A small problem is that you would, in each part of the city, be able to point out things which do'nt fit in, and that now and then you would have to cover quite some distance to find everything that does. In his chapter on the Baroque Mc Gregor passes from the Via del Quirinale, by way of the Palazzo Barberini to the Villa Borghese. I admit that there is a lot of Baroque to be seen, but I sincerely hope he took a bus to do so (number 10, if I am not mistaken). Mc Gregor knows Rome a lot better than I do, I presume, while behind the things he writes looms a lot more knowledge which he doesn't use. And of course, it always is a pleasure to read someone who obviously loves Rome very much. And yes, he writes well, and yes, it must have been fun to write the book too. Yet, Rome from the ground up is really nothing more than a travelguide, without the facilities that normally accompany such a book. I find the title a bit of a gimmick and also the only pretentious part of the book. What is meant, is that a chronological presentation of Rome is from the ground up.  I guess the problem with Rome from the ground up is who its reader is supposed to be. Although the author himself suggest that while "the book stands on its own as a portrait of the city, its format and organisation also makes Rome from the ground up a useful guide to travelers", I don 't think I agree, on both points that is. As a guide it is not of much use, and you would be better off buying a Blue Guide (still the best). As a book to read at home it is only of use if you know Rome well.  But then, if you know Rome well, this is no longer the sort of book you read. The long descriptions of streets, palazzi, museums etc. which you don't see, can be very fatiguing. As a travel guide it doesn't work. The author seems to have guessed the problems readers could have with his book. "Maps can be had free everywhere in Rome", he says, "and updating guides all the time has become useless in these modern internet-times." I find that rather silly. When you are walking through Rome, internet is not of much use. Having a map and a guide at the same time is in practice laborious. On the other hand I agree that you will always need a good map. But it is nice if text and maps are integrated in a sensible way, as long as you are walking, especially since Rome is not New York. I usually take several guides with me. At the same time Rome from the ground up, although well written, is also somewhat superficial, even while it has some nice personal touches. But if you for instance would really visit the musea which are described in the book, the texts there wouldn't be of much use. You might even have problems finding the entrance of the place you try to visit, or not find it at all. Ostia isn't there, the catacombs aren't, and 20th century EUR, the part of the city started under Mussolini, and finished after the second world war, gets no treatment, which I find a pity. And it wouldn't be fair to complain about that to the author. A guide doesn't have to deliver an ongoing story and can structure its text in an easier way. And still the Blue Guide needs more than 600 pages. In short, while using Rome from the ground up as a guide would not be comfortable, reading it at home is not much use too. Bit of a waste really.  
 I recieved these for a shower gift on a Saturday, by Monday 1 had already broke, and I mean shatered in the sink, I didn't drop it or anything, but they are very nice looking, just don't expect them to last 
 I haven't read many of her newer books but I saw this one in paperback and grabbed it.  So disappointing!! The plot was formulaic and the continual, random introduction of a new character without explaining fully their significance was extremely annoying and confusing.  I forced myself to read this book thinking that eventually it would hook me; it never did.  I usually inhale good books (read in a couple days, a week max) but this one took me three weeks to read. The ending "twist " seemed forcibly abrupt and unbelievable.  MHC is/was a great author, but I'd recommend sticking with her older books 
 I purchased two of this item, for a total of four space-bags. I used them according to the instructions, putting less into them than the commercials indicate. Within days, all four had leaked - not one kept the air out. 
 Irvine Welsh has been a lot of things to a lot of different people- some say he's the best thing to happen to British writing in a decade, some say he's just a flash-in-the-pan with uncouth sensibilities who writes thoughtless, violent stories about amoral scumbags. Say what you will about Welsh as a writer- be it that he's talented, sick, brilliant, strange or just plain nuts- but he is, and has never been, boring. Until now. "Marabou Stork Nightmares" is a colossal letdown after the one-two punch of "Trainspotting" and "The Acid House", a jumbled, convoluted tale about a repugnant [man] trawling his last moments away in a life that most closely resembles a bedridden hell. This is not the first first-person account of a psychopath that Welsh has written- see later, his aptly-titled "Filth"- but even at his worst, D.S. Bruce Robertson had a sort of perverse wit to him, while this story lacks anything short of coherence, wit, humor or even plot.  The protagonist of this brutish tale is Roy Strang, a bedridden criminal pissing the last moments of his sad life away in a bed, ready to die. As he slowly slips in and out of consciousness, Roy reflects on the family upbringing- that entailed rape, sexual molestation and the vicious abuse of his right-wing Uncle- that led him to this state. We see later in his life, as Roy attempts to straighten himself out, get a job and "choose life", as it were, but we continue to see that he cannot escape the sins of his past. All the while, he hunts the formidable African Predator the Marabou Stork- a personification of all the misery, evil, hatred, pain and badness in Roy himself- on a wild Safari in Africa, that ostensibly all takes place in Roy's morphine-and-depravity-addled brain.  The novel proves that Welsh can still pull plenty of tricks out of his proverbial hat when it comes to language- some of his bawdy, boy's-night-out Scottish dialogue still provokes a chuckle or two, while the disgusting gangrape scene towards the book's denouement is one of the more haunting I have read in recent memory. And yet, for all its mild pleasures, this book still sees Welsh falling majorly short of the mark, sinking into the endless mire of Roy Strang's egomaniacal fever dream. Consider this one a real "Nightmare" 
 I missed the book club meeting that discussed this book but thought I would read the book anyway because everyone seems so enamoured with Ms. Cleage.  I read the first 150 pages of this book and I am bored to tears.   All of the reviews call this book astonishing; did the reviewers read the 1st 150 pages--nothing, absolutely NOTHING interesting happens in these pages.  Even if the author made up for it in the last 150 pages, this book could not be an astonishing book.  I will not be reading anymore Cleage books.  I, however, will try to finish reading this one since I started it.  My hopes for some excitement in the book,however, has been shattered by the other reviewers who state that the book doesn't even have excitement at the end of the book 
 I agree with Mr. Oshell on almost every point. I find John Calvin, in this writing, and in many others, confused about what he really believes.  He speaks of 'justification', 'sanctification', regeneration', 'grace', even 'faith', but cannot seem to come to an agreement with himself as to what these important terms mean.  After reading a good amount of the Institutes, I think John Calvin thought they all meant the same thing.  But of course, according to Calvinism, knowing about these things was ever meant for most of the world anyway, and knowledge of them doesn't make any difference to anyone's eternal destiny, so really, what does it matter who does or doesn't understand these terms?  The reader might find his eyes spinning in his head after a short while.  Much philosophy indeed....  John Calvin, like Calvinist writers in general, must of necessity give opposite meanings to the words of the living God in Scripture in order to teach what it is they believe, "Calvinism".  But I think any true 'believer' should be horrified by Calvin's notion that salvation and damnation of individuals are utterly left to chance, a decision already made by God for each of us before the foundation of the world, and most importantly, arbitrary in regard to "faith". God merely made the decision without any regard to His foreknowledge of a person's faith or lack of faith in Christ.  Unbelievable.  But this teaching comes from Calvin's belief that there IS no condition for salvation, that faith in Christ is not necessary for those 'elected' by God to salvation in eternity past.  God, they say, simply "gives the gift of faith" to the ones He has already elected to salvation (making them meet the apparent condition for salvation (faith) in John 3:16-18).  To hell with the rest, literally.    Is it any wonder that Calvinism has never enjoyed any peace in Christian circles?  The 'goodwill' of Calvinism's gospel is simply not meant to be goodwill to 'all'.  As for spiritual deception, Mormonism and the Watchtower Organization can't hold a candle to the brilliant deceptions of Calvinism.  Let me emphasize "BRILLIANT".  Calvin's Institutes turns truth on its head.  Just do as the Bereans did and never fail to compare what Calvin says in his Institutes with the word of God to see if they are in agreement.  What I found in Mr. Calvin's writings was 'the word of men' we read about in 1 Thes 2:13.  It is difficult for me to accept the fact that otherwise intelligent men would even 'want' to believe Calvin's horrible teachings. But its true, one's faith is a thing of the heart, and we can all believe whomever and whatever we want (I made the free will choice to reject John Calvin's teachings).      
 I did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion.  While it was unique, it was too hard to get into.  I also really hated the story, it was also too confusing to follow, to strange to enjoy, and to boring to care.  I totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read.  The only reason that I read this was because it was for my book club.  The reivews, by the way, in the club were 50/50.  Some loved it, the rest of us hated it.  There was no in-between.  I would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to English majors, I'm not sure who else would like it 
 The two most slanted news organizations on our planet.  Don't forget CNN had their own Baghdad bureau before the war.  The only people recommending this book are al-Qaida supporters.  Sad, but true.  
 I've been a fan of this series for years, but this one was really disappointing. One almost gets the impression that Braun herself has lost interest in the series...(IF she even writes the books anymore!?) Of course, the books have always been slow, but they did have a certain charm to them, making them the perfect bedtime material...but, boy, did I sleep well,when I was reading THIS one.. 
 Has this been any other author, I would have stopped reading after the first few chapters.  But as is sometimes the case with her earlier works, I kept reading on in hopes that the book would get better - it didn't.  After I got through enough of the book (having only about 100 page left to read), I just had to skip to the end to get the experience over with.  As another reviewer worded, this was quite one-dimensional and the characters were a bit disturbing, but not in the good sense, and the story just dragged on for far too long.  I grew annoyed having put so much time into reading this and it was quite the let down.  Tyler's later works are much better and if you want to get of those books, you'd be better off.    I don't recommend this book at all 
 The first Butterfly Effect is one of my all-time favorite movies. With that in mind, I eagerly started watching BE2. Within the first 5 minutes it became clear that I was going to have to stretch the truth in order to claim this was a good movie. But after finishing it, it was clear that I would have to flat-out lie to do that.  There is one and only one redeeming factor in this movie: Erica Durance naked. But it's too softcore, short, and pointless to really be worth anything.  The writing is terrible. The story is lifted directly from the original, only without any semblance of personal feeling or emotion. It manages to be both predictable and borderline nonsensical, a feat unparelleled in modern film. The protagonist comes off as an idiotic, self-concerned, petty jerk that even jerks would have a hard time identifying with. The acting is...barely passable, for the most part, but the story's protagonist is just plain bad at expressing all the things this character needs to express.  The first one was great because you never knew exactly what to expect - how long would he be able to keep doing this? Would this one be the last? In the sequel, this is gone, but without any extra twists or added value to keep it interesting.  If you have any fond memories of the first one, avoid this turd 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 A very entertaining and well written history, but the passionate arguments against government taxation and regulation of smoking (hot political topics these days) are hard to take seriously.  Gately denies that second hand smoke poses any danger at all to non-smokers.  He is convinced that advertising restrictions, cigarette taxes, public smoking bans, and public service ads have no effect on how much people actually smoke.  (They merely infringe on the "rights of smokers.")  He ridicules the notion that cigarette smoke could be harmful to children.  His humor is usually enjoyable, but it is sometimes inappropriate (smoking-related deaths are actually a fairly serious matter), and it is sometimes hard to tell when he is joking.  For example, he cites UK government data that smokers die 16 years earlier than non-smokers and talks about all the money this saves the government in pensions, adding, "It follows that it would be financial madness for the British government to ban smoking, and unless a better argument than its official estimated death toll of 120,000 smokers per annum can be found, smoking is unlikely to be prohibited in the British Isles."  Is this funny?  Am I supposed to laugh or cry?  Gately frequently comes across as a loving mother who has discovered her son is a killer and has not quite come to terms with the fact.  She can't help wishing for him to succeed, even while acknowledging her sympathy is problematic and recognizing the irony of her situation.  Still, only a true tobacco believer could write in his concluding paragraph that "to the 1.2 billion smokers of the world, tobacco is not just a killer, but a pleasure, a comforter, and a friend...  Tobacco has recently been discovered to protect against some of the most devastating ailments of old age, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.  It has also been shown to guard against cancer of the womb....  Many great men and women have left elegant testimonies to their tobacco habits, which will be joined, I believe, with others made in centuries to come." 
 (First of all, this is coming from a huge [Christian] fan of the HP books.) While some of his points do make since, most are not sufficiently explained, and are therefore unbelieveable.  Killinger makes a lot of glaring mistakes; for example, he doesn't seem to understand the concept of a dementor other than the fact that it can (can being the main word) suck out one's soul.  He also gives quite a few incorrect discriptions of exact events in the books.  (An example:  He said that Hagrid had turned Vernon Dursley to a pig in Sorcerer's Stone, but he actually gave DUDLEY Dursley a pig's TAIL.)  The one crucial point that I think he has actually brought across is the role of good vs. evil in the series. Overall, if you are a person who is looking to see if the series is appropriote for you or your children, buy this book.  Otherwise, if you are a fan looking for a good defence of the books, don't waste your time 
 The item arrived promptly but I am unable to view it as it is for Region 1 and I need Region 4 but this was not stated in the ad 
 I purchased this projector to watch movies at home and have not been pleased with its performance.  Our DVD inventory includes both 4x3 and 16x9 formats.  As this is a dedicated 3x4 projector, DVDs that are 16x9 will have black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.  If you have a dedicated 16x9 screen, like I have, this will not work if you like a clean image at the edge of the screen.  If I mount the projector to fill the screen, then the 4x3 DVD image is projected above and below the screen.  Perhaps I don't have it setup correctly, but that was the best I could do.  Specs say this projector has component video inputs, which it does.  However, they are part of the monitor input jack and you have to spend another $20.00 for an adapter to connect to them.  Our family room is 12 X 23 and the fan is too loud when you have the bulb in high setting - you do get a great picture, though.  We could barely hear the fan in low setting but the room has to be VERY dark to get a decent picture.  Projector comes with a CD that has the manual and a neat screen size calculator that figures the distance from the screen the projector should be located 
 I have to agree with the last reviewer, that this book is a bit of a disappointment. Perhaps that is due more to my expectations of the book than the actual content. What I was looking for was concrete techniques to assist in raising children bilingually, with information backed up by research from the field. There is a large amount of research on the topic of bilingualism, and it would be nice to find it summarized in a single volume. However, this is a series of excerpts taken from various parents in bilingual situations together with reasonably obvious statements, with little relation to linguistic research. While the various opinions from parents were interesting, this could be found online at a bilingual forum. The rest, you will probably already know by instinct 
 This novel could not hold my interest.  I am an Anne Perry fan, but could not get into this book.  I couldn't really bond with any of the characters and the plot was uninteresting.   I'm really disappointed, because I was looking forward to a new series by her.  Joseph and Matthew lost their parents to murder and Joseph lost two close friends to murder, yet there didn't seem to be much emotion.  Maybe Ms. Perry tried to tell too many stories within one story.  In reviewing the book, it's hard to pin point exactly why I didn't like this book. I would skip this series and read the Pitt series.   
 This is not the version of Pirates shown on Great Performances. It is a video of the actual stage performance in Central Park. The video quality, sound, and stage settings do not compare to the Great Performances version, which was superb. Very disappointing 
 First I have to admit, I only read 150 pages of this book.  That was all I could possibly stand.  Life is just too short to waste on a book you don't enjoy reading.  Ballas, our main character, is a drunk and a scoundrel.  One is not sure whether they should root for or against him.  He is a vagrant, thief, and all around not so nice guy.  He steals a mysteriously beautiful gemstone, which sets into motion something........I got too bored to stick around and find out what.    The first 150 pages are filled with Ballas being beaten within an inch of his life, coming to, healing enough to move on, only to be beaten within an inch of his life again.   ok, we get it, let's get on with the story.  I just got too bored to stay with this one folks.  Maybe it got better, but to me, if an author can't write well enough to grab and maintain my attention, their book isn't worth my time.  There are too many great books out there.  Read this one at your own risk, if you can stay awake through it, that is 
 This so called "expert" wrote nothing more than a re-worded transcript from a witch trial. It's presented as narrow minded now as it was centuries ago. Mr. Russo you should be ashamed. You have taken a beautiful, accepting religion and bastardized it to fit your own clouded vision. You've completely misrepresented Wicca and all it stands for. 
 While this is a very high quality edition of the story of Pinocchio, I decided to return the book.  Why?  Because chapter 15 is entitled "Pinocchio is hanged" and includes an illustration of Pinocchio hanging by his neck from a tree with his hands tied behind his back.  Although this may be true to the story of Pinocchio, I didn't feel that a book containing an illustration such as this is suitable for young children 
 I have always used Norton antivirus, and had no problems with it at all. I have recently had to migrate to Outlook 2003 and Norton IS 2005 and have non-stop system crashes. I have now uninstalled it and resinstalled my old version of Norton Professional and hey presto everything is working again - and not talking two hours to load. 
 I am a 39 year old adoptee. What rubbish! Your parents are the people that raise you, period. My parents raised me to believe that my adoption was a 'non-issue', and I was always fine with that. Adoption is a truly wonderful thing, and I wish it were done more instead of abortion. I have never felt different from other kids who were not adopted. I just got my parents in a different way. If you are a 'progressive' parent that thinks you need to dwell on 'issues' and 'grieve', you will certainly create those issues.    Get a life people. Worry about something meaningful, please.   I've met my birth parents, found them when I was about 30. Nice people, but complete strangers. Not my parents. Not much in common. Grateful they put me up for adoption so I could have a good life that they would've been unable to give me.  Much more harm is being done today to children that their teenage and single moms keep them out of selfishness, and ruin the kids' life because they aren't ready to be a parent. If they really cared about their child, they would give them up for adoption. It takes courage, selflessness and maturity to make the decision to give a child up for adoption 
 Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."  I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives.  
 The author leads us to believe that prohibition of drugs in any form is a terrible idea and is the reason why so many people are getting rich off of the drug trade.  His theory has many holes and though I understand what he is trying to say, I didn't like  his Marxist-style commentary.  He rambles through the first 5 chapters like a lost tourist and has some very foolish ideas on how to treat the drug epidemic.  Not one of the better books on the subject of drug use and abuse 
 No matter how one feels about Peter Singer as an ethicist, this books shows he's thoroughly incompetent as an editor. I am rather surprised that Oxford University agreed to put its imprint on this volume as an "Oxford Reader." The selections from pivotal ethicists, e.g., Aristotle, Kant, Hume, Bentham, and Sidgwick are ridiculously lowly, inconsequential, or scattered, so "coherence" is lost. Their minor pericopes omit their critical and vital insights; all their important ideas are egregiously overlooked. E.g., Aristotle's doctrine of the mean, eudaimonia, Kant's doctrine of Kingdom of Ends, Categorical Imperative, are just some of the major omissions. Natural law theory doesn't mention the name of Aquinas. The selections that support an evolutionary orientation are a little bit better. The selection from Hume on benevolence is marginal. The essays by Ayer and Wittgenstein are great, but not enough to justify this book. I can't imagine what this book is good for. It certainly fails as an introduction to ethics. It also fails as a current controversy in ethics. It might be used as an intermediate ethics course for some of the pericopes. To say this book is a disappointment is an understatement.  Disclaimer: Singer is a utilitarian. I don't know how anyone in the 21st C. can use utilitarianism as an "ethic" much less as a system of "morality." Scheffler, Williams, Nozick, et alia should have put this nonsense to rest, as Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao, and even Hitler were great utilitarians, which is precisely the point. But that aside, I think it skews his editorial judgments as well. For ethics, Aristotle, for morality, Kant, and for benevolence, Smith and Hume. Otherwise, leave the utilitarian calculus for tyrants 
 Badly organized book.  Repetitive text and graphs.  Stretching theories.  Bad analogies.  Hardly provide any useful framework can be used in real life.  Like the auther is sitting in a small dark room and murmuring to himself 
 As a debut, this novel is noteworthy, and the author paints a highly visual picture of the Africa she knows.  To me, the disappointment with the novel was the author's inability to go deeper.  It stayed very "surface level" with me, reads almost like a "young adult" novel.  Also deals with the subject of physical abuse, so those who are unable to handle such content should avoid it.  
 I bought this book thinking it will help me in my research on the myths of the Shaolin temple's involvement with MA. This is a edited version of a book that was published in China in c.a. 1918 and it is one of the sources of the myths about CMA. Smith's book has to little, to called it a "definite" guide is misleading 
 as much as I have been a lifelong fan of black moon and buckshot in general this album just lacked the ironically titled "chemistry"between buckshot and 9th Wonder.  The beats were a bit lackluster and boring and rides that razor thin line of boring and laid back with most of the beats raiding the boredom zone.  they are working on a part two so I hope they take their times to create something permament rather than something disposable as this album was.  
 I was excited too see my very own Weil-McClain heating system pictured through-out the book. What I didn't find out is how it really worked or how to troubleshoot it. Safety is the author's first concern and first chapter  in the book. I could find nothing explaining how to correct the excess  pressure causing my safety valve to drip at times 
 This cd its just horrible, they sold only 10,000 copies enough to pay for their instruments lol ! There are better bands than this an example is bleeding through so i think no one cares about a re release peace out 
 I would like to cordially invite Dr. John Gray to visit and work in the public school system, of which many campuses are run exclusively by women. These women can be very matter-of-fact, get-down-to-business and get-the-job-done.  Those gals are there to work.  Some of them try to bond emotionally and some do not.  But they get their jobs done.  They often have to do things they don't "feel" like doing, but they do it and they do it darned well.    I think the best cross-gender communication, whether at work or socially, can be as follows;  1.  Listen as well as talk. 2.  Respect the other person's views. 3.  Don't try to make a psychological statement about another person's style, whether male or female. 4.  Don't hog the limelight. 5.  Respond with empathy. 6.  Park your ego outside the door.  In other words, practice GOOD MANNERS!  It works every time 
 I usually don't review books I didn't finish reading or movies I didn't finish watching, but this was just way too boring to justify wasting more of my time on, even though I listened to it as an audiobook so I could do other things while "reading". I turned it off after six chapters and I'm not likely to finish it. This is my first Nora Roberts book and if they're all like this I really don't have any clue why she's so popular. I'll try one of her mystery novels before judging her, however.   Stay away from this one. 
 Well if you want to make money by going 'downmarket' and appealing to the teenybopper market and moving away from your traditional market, then this is probably the way to go.  As for musical quality and originality I think this is a poor production.  If you want to listen to a record with some more sensible and poignant lyrics, listen to Rihanna's 'unfaithful 
 I can't review an item you haven't sent me yet 
 It's not too much to infer that the author's main concern in writing this book was to be the first person to deliver a Java image processing book (1999), since he says as much in one of the many radically uninspired (and frequently self-generated) "pithy" quotes that precede each chapter.    Every bad thing the other readers have said about this book is true- here's my contribution. Throughout the book, he references advanced mathematical concepts as though the expected reader was a graduate mathematics major. Nevertheless, when the concepts get easy enough to cover comprehensibly without too much effort, he explains them in detail. So, for instance, he goes into what a histogram is, what the formula for finding the roots of a binomial equation is (which we all learned in 11th grade ) etc. etc. Compare this to his explanations of the higher mathemtical concepts upon which his code depends which seem to be penned in order to win some contest for expository opaqueness.   Basically, if you can understand his fragmented, confusing, telegraphic and seemingly careless explanations then you already know enough so as not to need the book in the first place.   But hey, it was first.     
 I borrowed Changing Minds from the library looking for a foray into the science of altering opinion. The book is mostly write ups that are not supported.As other reviews say 'where is the proof? 
 wow, how i can write a review about the item i have not received so far. i ordered this case on march 7th and to day is april 10th and it seems out of stock so far.well, i,m still waiting........ 
 This should be a .pdf that you can download for free.  Don't waste your money, just look at the internet 
 I loved the writing style in this book--very bright and lively--but the book, to me, was too long because of the bitter, depressing sex scenes. Franzen's people really don't like themselves or other humans, and that ends up being unpleasant. In spite of the wacky humor, the book is really very dark. 
 	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a story of love and compassion, which takes place during the beginnings of the French Revolution. Despite the fact that many aspects of the revolution are portrayed well in the novel, the book is still a tiring read and requires a strong liking for Dickens' writing style.  	Throughout the novel, Dickens bogs the story down with excessive descriptions and meaningless scenes. The language is relatively simple and easy to comprehend, but the extra descriptions make the novel difficult to fully understand. Most of the characters in the novel are completely unrealistic, which makes it difficult for the reader to relate to what is going on. The character of Lucie Manette, is portrayed as the perfect women with absolutely no flaws. Her character is the supposed epitome for women, but in truth, is highly improbable. Throughout the novel, Dickens' does a great job at keeping the story dry and unentertaining, giving little to no excitement to cause the reader to want to continue. Despite these countless imperfections, Dickens' does manage to be partially successful in his quest to portray the revolution.  	The book, with all its shortcomings, did reveal to the reader, the atrocities that occurred during the French Revolution, and the events that led to it. The abuse of the nobles, and the radical ideas of the revolutionists are all shown in many parts of the novel. The one other aspect that Dickens got right in his novel was the character of Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton is the only character in the story that many readers can relate too and understand a variation of what Carton feels. Carton is a lawyer who feels that everything he has done in his life has been wrong and believes that he can do no good in life. This characteristic is common among people, and Dickens manages to capture that aspect of humanity precisely.   	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, is a slow moving book with numerous flaws that cause the reader to lose interest fairly often. Dickens' overuse of description and unrealistic characters add to the book's dryness. However, Dickens does capture a time in history with great accuracy. This is a book for a reader who likes Dickens' overzealous descriptions and enjoys slow moving stories. 
 while I appreciate what Tipler was attempting to accomplish, he fails miserabley both from a theological and a scientific perspective.  skip this one! 
 Way too many names, Way too much detail. There is a story hidden in this book, but it is hard to dig it out. It could have been a good read. 
 I picked up this book after seeing David Sedaris on a late night talk show. He seemed hilarious, almost like a younger, bemused Woodie Allen type.   While the book is well written, his views on life are very disappointing to me. In his previous professions/stages of life, he was a ne'er-do-well, a loafer, well, basically a bum. Many of his stories are made up of snide commentaries on others around him who were progressing through their lives. These folks were getting in the way of David's quest of just figuring out how to get the next hit of recreational drugs.   He can become the poet laureaute for the younger generations whom life is never easy enough and can't put enough blame on those around them. 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 You get a few outfits and some new furniture but not a lot.  With all of the free stuff out there to download for The Sims, the Stuff Pack is not very worth it.  Maxi is just milking the franchise for every penny 
 Like many other reviewers, I struggled with this book. For more than 600 pages, Anna Wulf explores every thought and emotion that comes into her head and tries to make sense out of her life. This might be an interesting book for fiction writers, who might understand the elaborate process Anna goes through to create characters and combine her life with her art. But for the average reader, this is just too much and too long.  I am very patient with novels. Perhaps too patient, because I should have put this one down sooner. I got all the way to page 500 before I realized I just couldn't go on. And it's quite depressing to invest so much time in a book and then put it down. Doris Lessing says herself that no one should force themselves to read a book they are not connecting with. I should have taken her advice sooner. But while some books you might not just be 'ready' for, I don't think I will ever be ready for this one.   It's disappointing because I am a Doris Lessing fan. The Four-Gated City explores many of the same themes - an emotional breakdown can be constructive in order to build yourself back up whole and understand the world around you. Anna Wulf did have a fragmented mind, as demonstrated through her keeping of four separate notebooks. She was kept together by the routines of her life, such as making breakfast for her daughter. When she didn't have anything constructive to do, she thought herself to death. And if you read this book, you'll likely be right there with her - going crazy. 
 Ms. Reichs has lost the recipe, or at least the focus and formula that has brought her success prior to Cross Bones. Although not nearly as bad as P. Cornwell's last two or three misfires, Reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here. In this offering, Temperance is out of character, out of both style and focus, and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous; a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product. Even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice Reichs has maintained in her many Brennan novels. Having finally given up on Cornwell, after many years, I'll hang in there for one more Temperance Brennan dig; everyone is entitled to one gong 
 Reading the other reviews, I see some people are so admiring of M. Night Shyamalan that anything he writes or directs is a work of creative genius. No doubt Shyamalan is talented but maybe his fame and fortune came too soon to keep his ego in check. I know some of the people mentioned in the book and was curious how their interactions with Shyamalan would be portrayed. Shyamalan is his own number one fan and he has no patience for anyone who disagrees with him or critizes his work. He has had a few successful movies and believes all studio executives should trust in him completely. I was amazed that Shyamalan approved of the book since it shows so much of his darker side. Shyamalan sets his own rules. He can feels he has the right to demand a certain salary but then feels  betrayed by an actress who asks for more than the SAG minimum he has offered her. He loves his family yet doesn't seem to accept that a film executive can break his rules by placing her family above work. The book is worth a read if you are a Shyaman fan or wonder what led up to the disaster that became LADY IN THE WATER. There is no doubt that M. Night Shyamalan is a rare talent with new ideas. It is only his ego that stands in his way of even great succes 
 This book is beyond boring - it is quite simply the worst guide to literature and education around.Clumsy writing, Noddy-level intellect, endless waffle - this book has it all. Only buy for use as a literary sleeping pill or if you want to encounter and experience the work of dull, simple-minded academics who live under the delusion that they are interesting and profound. The world would be a better place without this monstrosity. Avoid unless very very stupid 
 I read most of the book last night and was disturbed by several things - The author deliberately blurs the line between "Arab" and "Muslim." He calls non-Arabs "whites," and makes whites sound like low class, trailer trash, uneducated red necks. Aren't Arabs white? I was offended that he mentioned Danny Thomas as an example of all the fine Arab people who have come to US to find a better life. Yes, Danny Thomas was Arab, but not a Muslim. Maharidge quotes an Arab comedian as saying that there's so much discrimination against Arabs. But unless they point out that they are an Arab, how would one even know? How can you treat someone different, unless they point out how different they are?   I have personal involvement in two of the stories quoted in the book, and know that facts presented are incorrect. I think it's grossly incompetent and irresponsible for an author to present a work of nonfiction without verifying his information.  Knowing that some of the facts are wrong, I would look at the rest of the book with reservation. Maharidge treats those he perceives to be the underdog with sympathy, but paints those who speak against them as ignorant, uneducated bigots.  Maharidge's premise that contemporary America dangerously resembles the Weimar Republic, or "Heimat," that led to Nazi Germany is an oversimplification of the current government of the US.  This proposition is deliberately anti-administration, inflamatory, and a grab for publicity. 
 The book is not bad if you can get over the liberal agenda. What would be expected from Mike Wallace? I hate to admit this, I would like to have seen historical pictures of the CMH and its recipients. 
 I love hatebreed, but it's now time to progress the style. This would've been a great cd if they had not already done the style 3 times in a row. The music sounds forced and generic. If this is the first hatebreed record you plan on buying, don't buy it. Anyone of the hatebreed records listed below will leave you more than happy, and will definitely be your moneys worth. As terrible as this album is, it's still worth seeing them live.   Rise of Brutality, Perseverence and Satisfaction is the death of desire are worth the money. 
 This book was required for a course I took called "Postmodernism". While I do not dispute the intelligence of these authors, I do question their communicability and the success of their "arguments". The task they take on is to destroy the Hegelian dialectic. Do they succeed? If you were to remove their self-absorbed semantics which riddle the text with unexplained vocabulary, sans apology, you would find there is not much really there. My proof is that a respected and intelligent professor could not interpret, rework and teach the same material much less communicate it. It is an exercise in ambiguity 
 I was completely enveloped in the stuff I read about this movie.  The main selling point was somewhere it says "the film Tarantino calls 'the roughest revenge movie ever'."  Now, I love Tarantino, but he must have been completely wasted, and/or thinking of a completely different movie when he said that.  That, or it was 1976.  This movie is absurd.  I'm sure back in 1974, it was cutting edge and over-the-top and totally controversy-worthy.  Well it's 2006 now.  Blame it on desensitization, but I'm no more desensitized than anyone else that would be wanting to watch this movie.  The hardcore pornography is the only thing that might cause a stir these days, but it won't because you'll see worse things popping up while you browse the internet on any given day.  Violent? HA! Anyone buying this hoping for a fun action-gore movie will be let down.  Here is a summation of the violence and gore in this movie:  Girl gets shotgun.  Girl shoots everyone in the gut in ULTRA SLOW MOTION with shotgun.  Girl also kung-fu's a few dudes in ULTRA SLOW MOTION with unimpressive chops and kicks and throws.  *spoiler* Girl busts a cap in a dude and proceeds to own him in a pretty cool manner involving a hungry hungry horse and a rope. *End Spoiler*.  That's all.  The effects of these people getting shottied to death are horrible.  It looks like something from a bad student film.    I give this movie 2 stars for one reason;  If it were remade today, it might be interesting.  They could jazz it up with some not ULTRA SLOW MOTION fights, some modern special effects, and some frigging music.  I don't think there was 30 seconds worth of music in the whole movie.  No ambience at all.    Plus... an above-average looking girl gets her eye cut out with a scalpel and proceeds to wear an eye patch, which everyone knows is awesome.  
 To say this was a dissapointment is an understatement. By track three i wondering if this was the same Edwin McCain that had made the masterful 'misguided roses' because this is so BLAND! it really was a struggle to listen to the whole thing and keeo my eyes opened-radio friendly isn't the word! I guess some of the signs were showing in the tinsel and tap shoes dvd with the ultra slushy 'couldn't love you more' and 'shooting stars' what do you get as a bonus track a version of 'maggie may' so close to the original as not to make a difference! The whole point of a cover is to do your own interpetation not a note for note re-run! So what has happened in the past years to make someone as talented as McCain heap this non-entity on his fans? Well giving Pete Riley a stab at songwriting both on his own and with McCain shows a possible drying up of ideas, because Riley's songs wouldn't be out of place on a latter day Fleetwood Mac album- they are that uninspired and there is hardly any barintone sax which always added to the songs and do i hear the dreaded drum machine in the mix? Come on Edwin a couple of half way decent songs on your new album is pushing the mark a bit. I for one will view the next album with a great deal of aprehension 
 In this book Fr. Bretzke teaches complex methods for evaluating the morality of actions - while Catholics who follow traditional teachings would call the same actions "sins" without Bretzke's methods.  Putting individual conscience above Church teachings identifies Fr. Bretzke with a breed of theologians who believe the Vatican II Council licensed them to redefine what the Church teaches and to claim that traditional Catholic morality is wrong. People who think the way Fr. Bretzke does never bother to explain why they stay in a Church they believe was so misguided for so long, or how they were granted the grace to understand more than the great saints that came before them.  Fr. Bretzke impugns the maturity of people who base their values on what the Magisterium teaches, using statements like the following: "To sit back and wait for a clear-cut response from any outside moral authority, even if it be the Pope, would result in a sort of moral infantilism."    Fr. Bretzke does not credit the writings of others who defend the Church's traditional teachings, prominently Pope John Paul II.   The following quote from the Pope's encyclical on moral theology seems to apply to theologians like him.  " Certain currents of modern thought ...  exalt freedom to such an extent that it becomes an absolute, which would then be the source of values. . . [T]he traditional doctrine ... is rejected; certain of the Church's moral teachings are found simply unacceptable; and the Magisterium itself is considered capable of intervening in matters of morality only in order to `exhort consciences' and to `propose values,' in the light of which each individual will independently make his or her decisions and life choices."  
 This is one of the worst Black Lace books I have ever read. Ilya, the main partner of the heroine, Beth, is a jerk. I pitied Beth more than I wanted to be in her place. Most of the sex scenes are degrading--not arousing. I  was surprised at the overall dismalness of this novel considering that I  found Ms. Lloyd's other Black Lace novel, Darker Than Love, quite  enjoyable. Don't waste your money. Buy an Emma Holly or Natasha Rostova  title or the aforementioned Darker Than Love instead 
 Bush at War is actually the first book written by Bob Woodward that deals with the GWB administration, but the second one I have read (I previously read Plan of Attack).  BAW covers the time from September 11, 2001 until early 2002, when the Bush team was celebrating victory in Afghanistan and looking ahead to Iraq.  The book follows (obviously) Bush and his inner circle, George Tenet and others in the CIA, and a paramilitary team covertly inserted into Afghanistan soon after 9/11 with the codename "Jawbreaker."  Since Plan of Attack is probably one of my all-time favorite books, I had high expectations for BAW.  However, these expectations were not met.  Overall, Woodward does a good job of giving a "fly on the wall" inside look at the workings of the administration.  It's obvious that he had a high level of access to documents and several of the main characters.  As a purely informative book, BAW is a five star slam dunk.  But we are not looking for simple facts, that's what newspapers and encyclopedias are for.  My disappointment with BAW stems from Woodward's writing style.  Often, I felt like he simply cut-and-pasted elements of meeting reports, etc. into the book and inserted paragraphs to break things up.  Some chapters are simply "Bush said this...", "Rumsfeld expressed concern that...", "Franks explained that..." and so on.  Sure the content is compelling, but I think that Woodward could use his good judgement and excise some of the more repetitive parts, especially for a book that is 350 pages long.  The worst part of it all is that the last 50 pages are an epilogue dealing with Iraq, which seems to last forever.  Woodward should have just saved this stuff for Plan of Attack.  If you're looking for a quick, informative read, by all means, buy this book.  But if you're expecting compelling drama or a real page-turner, look elsewhere.  Buy Plan of Attack instead 
 I have read every Leaphorn/Chee book by Hillerman more than once and am a great fan. I just finished this book and discussed it with a friend.. we both agreed it was so disappointing.. we cannot believe it was written by the same person. The writing was awkward and heavy-handed... by the second page I suspected something was wrong here. It reads like some cheap Harlequin mystery/romance. The sensitive handling of Navajo spiritual beliefs, the beautiful rendering of the landscape, the terse but meaningful conversations are all missing.  All I can say is, the publishers need to pay more attention to future manuscripts and insure that a writer of Tony Hillerman's caliber is not allowed to decline in the public eye... he has given us much enjoyment.... he deserves better.  And if someone else is fleshing out Hillerman's plot lines.. the public should be warned 
 Una interpretacin absolutamente falaz tanto de la historia como de la filosofa poltica. Un sinsentido que lamentablemente ha tenido enorme repercusin en la formulacin de polticas desde el imperio hacia la "periferia". Un deseo de teleologa desde la imposicin del poder. En fin, hay que leerlo slo para rerse un rato con tanto absurdo. 
 ...But it gets one star for the brief moments that Ricky Jay has in the film and another for portions of Alec Baldwin's performance.  Overall this is a stinker.  Mamet is not a good director.  He should stick to writing 
 This is perhaps the most liberal textbook I have ever read in my entire life. The authors come across as subjective and emotional, espousing the evils of capitalism and taking responsibility for one's own actions. 
 John Julius Norwich possesses a mastery of the English language expressed in flowing descriptive prose which envelops the reader to the point that you almost feel you were there.  Unfortunately he does so in apparent ignorance of any of the scholarship of the last twenty years, and indeed much of that since the Second World War.  His treatment of major issues such as the development of Pronoia simply does not fit the facts, while the minor innacuracies cast by the wayside remove any remaining credibility.  A good novel, but go to John Haldon for Byzantine History 
 Yes this book conjugates all of the Greek verbs.  There is just one problem.  It doesn't translate any of it to English.  So you can see all of the Greek verbs, but you don't know what any of them mean unless you are already fluent in Greek 
 J. L. Carr's A Month In The Country (1980), which is set in the 1920s, is the story of Tom Birkin, a budding restorer who accepts a job uncovering a church mural in a small Yorkshire village, a village predictably populated by greenhorns, cranks, and eccentrics of all stripes and colors. What is immediately apparent is that the novel is not a product of the earlier era in which it is set, nor is it an attempt to recreate the style of the period.   Though Carr attempts high British humor in the grand 20th century tradition of P. G. Wodehouse, Evelyn Waugh, Ivy Compton-Burnett, Stevie Smith, Denton Welch, and Muriel Spark, much of what is supposed to be funny throughout the novel is in fact only obvious, smug, and not nearly as intelligent or crisp as Carr apparently believes it to be. Thus, when Birkin's employer warns him about a scythe that hangs in the outdoor privy, Birkin speculates whether "it was the loss of life or only manhood he was concerned about," and most of the attempted humor continues at about this level.   A Month In The Country might have been saved by a compelling plot or theme, or simply a collection of perceptive insights uniquely expressed, but none of these elements are present, and so what little story there is merely plods cutely along. Whether is it is Carr himself, or merely Tom Birkin, who is so self-satisfied is difficult to say; either way, the combination of the anemic first person narrative and the idiosyncratic attempts at humor, in which the author indulges himself at every turn, sink the book quickly.  
 Having invested heavily in a single stock - WorldComm - Paulos laments his financial loss, and embarks to write a book where he takes the reader through a spectrum of equities analysis methodologies, and disproves their apparent success as attributes of illusions and perceptions. Through the use of thought experiments, he attempts to re-wire the readers to comprehend the true nature of randomness, which is more ordered than most people's expectations.   The good stuff aside, I am very disappointed with the book for two reasons. Firstly, the publisher's marketing of the book is highly misleading. It hints that the author used his professional skills as a mathematician to beat the market. As such I bought the book hoping to understand why the author failed, and hope to avoid his pitfalls. Instead, the author did not have any first hand experience with any of the techniques discussed. He simply did not apply any mathematical methods, or any method for that matter, during his compulsive purchase of WorldComm shares. So anyone hoping for case studies would be let down.   Secondly, Paulos' arguments are not all that convincing. While he successfully presents an alternative hypothesis based on the incorrect human perceptions of probability, he makes no attempts to disprove established theories. All he has achieved is simply to offer another explanation. The section on technical analysis is particularly poor, as his arguments were rather superficial, and amounted to simply saying technical analysts have not provided convincing prove - he does not feel he needs to go any further. What is confusing to me, is that he rejects technical analysis despite giving a marvellous introduction, and goes on to explain how and why technical patterns form, as well as admitting throughout the book that the psychology of the market is what moves prices - one of several core principles of technical analysis.   Having said all that, "A Mathematician Plays the Market" is an eye-opener in lateral thinking for the non-mathematically inclined, and is a recommended read for financial novices. Professionals in either fields can give this book a miss 
 Title begins:  "The Party of Death: The Democrats..."   Just tonight - August 14, 2006 - while being interviewed about this book on the Colbert Report, Ponnuru *clarified* that what he calls "The Party of Death" is really a collective of all who are pro abortion, regardless of political party! Ponnuru explained that he knows it's NOT ALL Democrats that are pro abortion, and he openly admitted there are Republicans who are pro abortion!  So Colbert asked Ponnuru if he had also included the word "Republican" on the book's cover (to be fair) to show that some Republicans are in Ponnuru's collective "Party of Death", and Ponnuru said no, he did not include the word "Republican" on his book's cover, and Colbert then asked that maybe Ponnuru didn't have enough ink to print the word "Republican" on the cover, or maybe Ponnuru didn't think he had enough room on the cover to include the word "Republicans" along with "Democrats" for the reader to understand his collective "Party of Death," which again, according to Ponnuru on national TV, is a group category that includes all who are pro abortion, not just Democrats.   Yet the inside flap of this book asks, Is the Democratic Party the "Party of Death"?   Does Ponnuru even know what he's talking about when he's this mixed up, completely contradicting his book's cover and inside flap on national TV? 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 the viuals were good, the actors were bad and the story line just blows 
 These cables are usually aftermarket and made somewhere in Asia. With that being said the quality control can be poor and there is no guarantee that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped. The software being aftermarket too, has glitches if it even works with yoyr phone. Despite what the descriptions say, this software and cable are not compatable with Mac at this time 
 It would take a book to answer all that is wrong with Farrell's reasoning, but to make a few points:  1. He implies that female 'circumcision' is much the same as male circumcision which is astounding but points to his general ignorance. If male circumcision is about teaching males to endure pain (actually more about male tribal bonding) then what on earth is a little girl being taught when she has her external genitalia cut away and is left with a tiny hole and a life-time of pain and health problems?? It's for protection? What, or whose, interests are being protected?   2. He does not acknowledge that the shorter male life-span is due to testosterone and all its consequences for males. Castration is known to increase the male life-span. Why do men even want more testosterone rather than less? Surely illogical?  3. The male 'instinct' to protect females is actually to protect the bodies men need for sex and reproduction. As more than 50 million females have been killed recently in Asia simply because they were female should make us question this supposed 'instinct to protect'. And protecting females most often translates into ownership and control. This is a similar logic to that of men in certain cultures that use the pretext of honor to justify the murder of females. Why do women need protection form their protectors? Men need to explain their logic here. Is it something like the protection criminal gangs provide for people against other criminal gangs?   4. Powerless men are created by male-male competition for access to young females and again, the sacred testosterone drives this not women.   5. His views on rape are ridiculous. Young human females have permanent sexual signals whether they want sex or not. These external signals do not usually reflect the females internal desires and concerns and this causes the confusion. Men are responding to fake signals that females don't know how to override without becoming invisible altogether.  6. This book is basically about all the hoops males try and jump through in order to rise in the male hierarchy and ultimately get their DNA into numbers of females.The men who fail are the men without power. Farrell wants us to feel sorry for them which is as likely as men feeling sorry for, and diverting their monogamous sexual interest and resources towards, unnattractive old women.   7.Farrell does not explain the irrationality of men rejecting and being abusive about women who don't sexually reject most men (ie the easy women) at the same time as they complain about the pain of being sexually rejected so often by women. There must be some mysterious male logic to it - perhaps situated in a fantasy world of being the only male who isn't rejected. Duplicity is clearly a male trait that farrell failed to mention.  8. It is a suspect logic that concludes that the people who have been the lawmakers and political leaders for millennia ie males, have actually only been acting in the self-interest of females. For men to have evolved a lack of self-interest is impossible. To argue that they have is Farrell's most ludicrous argument. Of course women also have self-interest, intimately tied to that of their children. The very real difference is that because we evolved with a mating system where females moved to male-bonded kin groups to breed males had the advantages of size, kin-bonding, no real reproductive demands of offspring and time and cicumstances that enabled them to be the rule-makers which included the enforcement of ownership and control of females as they were exchanged between groups for breeding. They may have felt varying amounts of power within that system and they may have felt the power of their sex needs as female power but to say that this is actually women having and exercising power is absurdly illogical and contrary to reality. It is another fantasy to add to that of South Sea Island free sex and mermaids.  This book is interesting for debate and as an example of male sexual frustration being blamed on women. Ultimately it is about how some men suffer trying to get sexual/reproductive access to females and might help us notice that the 'power' being defined is reproduction.  In a market where the supply of sperm far outstrips the tiny market of eggs it does reduce the value of sperm and create massive competition in males and competition in females for better quality sperm and/or extras that improve the outcome for offspring. Embedded in Farrell's books is the manipulative attempt to solve this by encouraging young women to 'put out' more. It's the same old male longing for 'free' sex ie the usual reproductive behavior of male animals where post-copulatory costs are carried by females.  In nature male animals experience far less or equal disposability as females when they are monogamous and concentrate more on parenting ie are symmetrical with female reproductive behavior. Can we look forward to this in the human male in the near future and solve the whole problem? Can we expect men might consider reducing the supply ie their sex-drive/seeking multiple partners and increasing their childcare. Reduce testosterone? Or is that blasphemy?  The new question is What do men want? The answer is the same as ever - sex. The methods of trying to get it are the same even when put in a new wrapper such as Farrell's ie irrationality, deceit and manipulation. Perhaps the real myth is the myth of ADULT power and we should direct our anger and frustration towards our gametes, hormones, fetuses, infants and children that are the real reason males and females exist, are pulled together and driven apart.  At least let's not create a new myth that the human male somehow managed to evolve a lack of self-interest. How gullible does Farrell hope we are 
 If Mr. Alterman just watched a nightly news cast of CNN, which are full of liberals and how they blast any and everything that does not agree with their limited perception of reality, then he would know that this is standard for all news on cable and web, tear apart the truth and just form a limited perception of reality. Uneducated viewers eat this liberal trash up like McDonalds fast food, however those who know better, avoid it because it can be damaging to one's mental health, but then again Mr. Alterman just wrote this book for the money, even if he makes a fool of himself doing it 
 For optimal being. one must overcome greed, illusions, and hate, and one must strive to achieve love and compassion.  Sounds interesting but unfortunately this one sentence is virtually all Fromm has to say on the subject.  After stating this, he then warns the reader that he has no intention of discussing the matter any further.  Instead the book is comprised of a series of random thoughts, all very brief, that are only marginally related to the art of being.  When he does elaborate, he merely goes off on a tangent with a quote from Freud or a reference to Marx (his gods).  I found this all rather loathsome.  I can only conclude that people who enjoy reading this drivel must be psychology majors.   This is one of the few books that I threw into the garbage upon reading it.  
 Would be 5 stars but for his rhyming about the Jews controlling the media on the track propaganda 
 In John Coleman`s book The Committee of 300, his publisher has book advertisements for some  occultic topics; the worst being Nostradamus. Nostradamus constantly used astrology,as verified in his book preface in  "The Centuries".               If a reader wants to know more  about whats going on,by a Christian source,might I recomend Dennis L.  Cuddy`s book" Secret Records Revealed ",or Joan Veon books.Both  very strong Christian authors 
 The problem is:  If you are not familiar with 20th Century Irish history, you will be lost reading this book when Part 1 ends. Doyle provides the reader with no historical background and writes the book assuming that the reader is all ready well-versed in Irish history.  I also had trouble visualizing Ireland, the places, buildings, streets, and the battle scenes, which I attribute to Doyle's lack of description and to my lack of Irish knowledge 
 The book made a huge impression on me 35 years ago. I fell in love with the story and was envious of Sam's year in the wilderness.  Last night, I found the movie for sale at a local book/music/DVD store. I vaguely remembered that My Side of the Mountain had also been a movie way back when, but I had forgotten all about it. I bought the movie and my wife and I watched it.  Ugh. This movie was a waste of time. It was poorly written, abysmally acted, and strayed so far from the book that it was virtually unrecognizable to anyone who read and loved the book.  My wife and I got the impression that the movie was adapted by someone who doesn't like hunting or killing of animals. Reference after reference was made in the movie to guns and hunters being bad, killing animals being bad and even Frightful was killed by a hunter apparently out shooting for sport. So Sam never got his deerskin outfit (as he did in the book). Instead, he bought leather gloves and wore some kind of yellow rain slicker during the winter.  At one point near the end, when Bando returned to visit, there were so many people in Sam's hollowed out tree that I could have sworn it was a magic tree, much like the magic tents in the latest Harry Potter movie. Small from the outside. But huge on the inside.  What an awful movie. Even the cinematography was horrid. If I had to watch Frightful fly around for minutes on end one more time I might have shot her myself.  Avoid this movie at all costs!  But please, do, read the book. It's one of the best children's' novels ever published 
 what a boring and pretentious movie! after tortured about 15 minutes, all the family members started to look each other or one another, then all agreed at the same time to reject this stupid shallow movie. depp or no depp, after twenty years, he's still playing the similar roles again and again, and never grows tired of it. but to me, and to us, enough is enough 
 I'll keep this review as short as possible due to this book being a very disappointing read.  I did read it with anticipation and an open mind hoping to uncover some gems of wisdom or valuable insights, what I found however as I read on was disappointing beyond words.  Joan Borysenko has a way of talking things down, making many generalisations along the way and often belittling other views on spirituality. This might have been forgiven if she had delivered a strong counter argument and provided us with a solid read however, Borysenko really did not support her theories and argument in any convincing way shape or form at all.  This book will also be quite disappointing for the intelligent woman, it should be re-titled A girls journey to God.  I was expecting more, much more, what I was left with was  a feeling of being let down instead.  I recomend potential readers to look elsewhere as this book plainly fails to deliver 
 DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. There, simple advice I wish someone had given me before I bought two of these. With the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase. Since it was 30 days outside the warrantly, apple support told me "sorry, tough luck." I made the mistake of buying another one figuring I just got a bad one and there was no way I could have the same problem again. WRONG!  Second ipod just died (same battery problem) - this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and, of course, by the time I got in I was past the 12 month warranty period (who keeps track of the purchase date? I sure didn't).  Other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year - it is a fantastic product. I'm just sorry that it didn't last (twice!) cause otherwise I'd be a fan 
 making clothes....think of the Butlerian strategy of it all!  Are they undoing gender? Wow! And on pennies a day, too!  Think of the androgynous gay boy who might wear the same clothes as his bestest girlfriend. Think of the subversiveness of it all!  Consider the fact that maybe the slave woman in Honduras made those clothes!  How Butlerian, indeed! 
 Donald Richie is an extraordinary interpreter of Japanese culture.  He has translated many great modern Japanese books and I'm certain his knowledge of Japanese language is incomparable.  Unfortunately, what he most certainly is not is a legitimate film critic. The damage he does to Kurosawa in this book is unwarranted and small-minded. More than I could take. Richie's understanding of film itself is completely inadequate, forcing him to resort to literary interpretive techniques in order to make up for his misunderstanding of cinematography and the nature of film in general. At the heart of it - he is incabable of "seeing" which is the foundation of Kurosawa's work. If you like wayward, stream-of-consciousness criticism masquerading as serious film criticism you'll certainly get your fill.  But most of what Richie does in this book is lob irrelevant pot-shots at Kurosawa, his personality, "mistakes" and the overriding theme (which becomes readily apparent towards the end) that his last films were just sentimental drivel. In fact I can't think of a single film covered in this book that Richie can bear to like wholeheartedly. Not without an uncomfortable juxtaposition of his true talent (literature) and film criticism - which I found to be completely inadequate. Another gaping hole is his obvious lack of understanding of the process of filmaking, or rather the way in which this process differs from writing in meaning and structure. His tone is pompous, downbeat and arrogant. For Ritchie - Kurosawa IS the film - and that is his greatest mistake - to turn the reader's attention to the "novel" of Kurosawa. Over and over he naggingly searches (pouring over grains of sand)for a continuity in Kurosawa's work that will bring a "literary" motif to everything he has done, that is to say, every disparity that exists between one film and the next is scrutinized under the lamp of literary criticism, and summarily dismissed. I can't imagine anything more inappropriate in a work of film criticism. All in all, this book comes off as a snotty jab at a master filmaker by a master spokesman for Japanese culture who simply does not understand film. I found reading it to be a wretched experience. And I hope you will too 
 I loved every Elizabeth Peters book I had ever read until this one. She is one of my favorite authors and I am a huge King Arthur fan. My expectations were high. The book was horrible. The plot was loose and the writing was like a bad romance novel. The only good parts were the descriptions of the towns and sights in the Enlgish countryside. From the copywrite this must be one of Ms. Peters early books. She should be ashamed to leave it in print. This is the only book that I ever bought that was so disapointing that it made me angry that I had spent money on it.  (For some reason following this review it says it is for the audio version of th book only.  I have never listened to the audio version.  This is referencing the actual written book. 
 While living in Rio I once asked my Marine Corps buddy Paul Y- why he thought Brazil never could get ahead.  He pondered for a moment then said: "Brazil is the only country that respects sociologists."  I didn't fully appreciate what he meant until I saw Bus 174, a film loaded with the blatherings of sociologists and social workers explaining the root causes of why a glue-sniffing, cocaine-snorting, fugitive thief named Sandro shot and killed an innocent girl on a Rio bus in a botched holdup.  Then I understood.  When you've got a Constitution that says no one under 18 can be held criminally liable for anything (Article 228), you come to realize that you're in the grips of a sociological experiment gone horribly, horribly awry, that you're living in a nightmare of supremely stupid paternalistic sixties' utopianism, in a society with prescriptions for social problems wholly unconnected to reality or actual human behavior.  Watch this film and you'll see this ethos in its full twisted glory, from a bogus examination of root causes, to dimestore Freudian psychology, to neo-Marxist analysis.  Ironically, it's that last analysis that really has any traction.  Poor kids got to eat too, and if they steal to get food, it's at least understandable (c.f. Prov. 6:30).  When you steal to buy cocaine, however, then my compassion ends, as does the compassion of most people who are grounded in reality and common sense.  In short, look for a lot of handwringing about why a young man would go nuts and kill a hostage, interspersed with victim, relative and police testimonials that are interesting and sometimes informative.  The incompetence of the police in the situation is staggering.  They must have had 50 chances for a perfect head shot and never took it.  What a disgrace for all concerned.  As for the fact that the cops who suffocated Sandro beat the rap, well that's why jury nullification was invented.  Since we're on this same general subject, may I share a true confession with you?  First, some background.  I was an observer to the precursor to the Candelaria Massacre.  Because I didn't have a car at the time, twice a week I walked from Ilha das Cobras through Praca Pio X (where the Candelaria Church is located) to get to the...well, to get to a building located on Av. Presidente Roosevelt.  On July 23, 1993, I happened to be walking through Pio X in the afternoon and saw the commotion as the cops rounded up a bunch of kids while others taunted the cops and threw rocks at the patty wagon.  That of course was the genesis of the cops' determination for payback later that night.  My confession: before the massacre walking through Pio X scared the hell out of me because of all the street kids, one of whom I once saw stealing an old man's watch off his wrist.  Walking through Pio X after the massacre, I never feared for my safety again.  Infer from my confession what you will. 
 As soon as I read this book, I wished I was the type of customer who sent back books of little value.  We have just began the process of adoption and we are exploring the different avenues available in domestic adoption so I thought this book would be helpful, but instead I found the same information I was able to obtain in less than one day at the computer, by entering "Adoption" in my search engine. The chapter containing the laws of every state was concise and puts it all in one easy package but I am not sure if that is enough to make this worthwhile. The book also lacked any real material on the homestudy process, what you might excpect from agencies versus attorneys versus state agencies, and the pros and cons of each.  So if you are completely new to the process of adoption, want the facts and nothing but the facts, are pretty sure that you want to use an attorney and conduct your own search for a prospective birth mother, then this book is for you.  If not you might want to look elsewher 
 I encountered this wildly overpraised critical study in college. I've should have known I was getting into trouble just by the stupid title. Hoffman's attempts at humor are lame (Camille Paglia is far more livlier  and insightful on Poe in her book "Sexual Personae")and his  insights pitiful (Paul Coates, in "The Realist Fantasy", gives a  much more subtle reading of Poe's "William Wilson" in just three  paragraphs than Hoffman is able to accomplish). What really undermines the  whole book is Hoffman's complete ignorance of fantastic literature which I  think would be essential to doing a critical study of Poe. Only passing  mention is made of E.T.A. Hoffmann, a major influence on Poe (and among  other great writers). Consequently the influence of Hoffmann's doppelganger  tales (such as "The Double" and "Devil's Elixirs") on  Poe's doppelganger tales ("William Wilson" and "The Black  Cat" among other tales)and their influence on such short story writers  as Borges, Paul Bowles, and Julio Cortazar, is not mentioned because Daniel  Hoffman is ignorant of it all and the whole genre. And his conclusion that  Poe only wrote "pure" tales devoid of any inner meaning is pure  bunk and pure laziness on Hoffman's part. To any unfortunate reader or  student who picks up Hoffman's book expecting any critical acumen be  warned: this book isn't it. Two other critical studies (David Ketterer, J.  Gerald Kennedy) are far better 
 I waited for Edgewater's sophomore debut with baited breath! I really thought they could top the wonderful mixture of songs on "South of Sideways"....didn't happen. I have to say I was really disappointed with this album.   At least in the first album the music flowed right along with the clear-as-a-bell lyrics, this album is full of screaming and herky-jerky riffs. It's almost as if they couldn't decide what sound they wanted, every song is a jumbled mess of chords. The album sounded like a mixture of Linkin Park and Jet. It's too bad, I hope their third offering is better 
 Diana's other novels I have read and re-read, getting blissfully lost in them each time. But this was didn't fit with the others. A little too "earthy" for my tastes 
 I decided to return this about 45 seconds after opening it.  The metal is thin and flimsy, and the construction very poor (e.g., little plastic end guards cheap looking and loose).  Also, it was a bit lopsided, so it did not sit squarely on my counter.  Maybe it works fine.  Who knows.  The design and manufacture were so poor, I didn't keep it long enough to find out 
 The good thing is that, except for the spring, the jumper is pretty nice. Unfortunately, the spring is THE most important part and it is not good. It has low elasticity and our baby did not like it as he had to push really hard to get anything exciting out of it. We gave it away for free and will buy a different one for our new baby girl 
 This album was one of my biggest "mistakes" (bought it 3 years ago). It's childish songwriting and really not good enough for an alternative-rock-band.  Better you buy instead: UP THE BRACKET (THE LIBERTINES) or some STROKES-stuff.. 
 Coltman gives his work credibility by freely admitting two important truths: Castro enjoys the warm support of a majority of the Cuban people, and Guevara and Castro were not at daggers drawn, but remained comrades-in-arms to the very end of Guevara's life. But with every political event and turning-point in the revolution that he describes, Coltman systematically distorts or omits the impact of popular mobilization by the Cuban people. He leaves out the milllions who marched in favour of socialism during the Mariel boat lifts in 1980. He says nothing of the hundreds of thousands who poured into voluntary work brigades during the fight against bureaucracy and stagnation in the late 1980s -- under the leadership of the Cuban Communist Party. He insists on seeing the revolution as the work of one talented megalomaniac, leaving out the facts in order to bolster this view. In 1960, for example, the Cuban delegation to the UN in New York was greeted by enthusiastic crowds in Harlem when Malcolm X arranged for the Cubans to stay at Harlem's Hotel Theresa. The delegation had been subject to politically-motivated and racist harrassment in their Manhattan hotel. Coltman portrays the incident as a shameful foray into the realm of prostitutes and shabby digs. Completely missing the point. As does his whole book 
 IF YOU ARE BUYING THIS BOOK FOR SOMETHING RELATED TO AN IPAQ....FORGET IT....BUT IF YOU NEED SIMPLE HELP WITH WORD, EXCEL OR OUTLOOK....THIS IS YOUR BOOK.... 
 To natter on about the omissions and inclusions is foolish given that the book in already in print.  However, if you ask "What's so holy about the number 50," the focus shifts. To quibble over the inclusion of Ann Sheridan and Esther Williams is not to see the issue clearly.  You could raise the number to 52 and add Shirley Temple and Betty Grable, whose importance in the "Studio Era" are second to none. Why not? Is it because "Leading Ladies" is merely a puff piece for TCM, which broadcasts primarily MGM, WB, and RKO films, and that Temple and Grable did their major work for TCF?  Consider further that that while the text was written and edited by Savady and Miller, their names do not appear on the cover or spine. Instead we get the names of Robert Osborne and Molly Haskall, TCM's co-hosts.  Could the woman who wrote the groundbreaking "From Rape to Reverence" have had anything to do with the sentence which introduces Deborah Kerr?  As to Osborne, while he knew many of these actresses personally and while his knowledge of American film is encyclopedic, none of that is evident in the text which is a rehashing of old stories and rumors.  There are errors.  Was Elizabeth Taylor 16 years old when shooting commenced on "A Place in the Sun"? Her filmography lacks "Callaway Went Thataway" and "Scent of Mystery," and--if one wished to be persnickety--"Quo Vadis?" and "Anne of the 1000 Days" as well.  Ava Gardner's lacks "The Bandwagon" and Grace Kelly's "The Children of Theatre Street." The book's treatment of alternative titles is hit or miss.  The titles of two of Taylor's foreign films are translated, while "Hotel International" and "The Light Fantastic" are ignored.  Do I like anything about this book?  Well, there are a few--a very few--photos which I hadn't seen before.  Other than those photos, "Leading Ladies" is both less than a library book and less than a coffee table book. Where does that leave it?  Read anything by David Thomson on these actresses and you'll get the facts plus incisive analysis. 
 This book was really really borrin 
 A friend of mine got me a subscription to this magazine because I like Cooks Illustrated.  This magazine is nothing but ads for snazzy expensive foods and restaurants.  There are so few recipies in it I wouldn't call it a 'cooking' magazine.  What few recipies they do have don't explain why they chose the ingredients used or give much detail at all.  If you consider yourself a 'foodie' who likes to go to fancy restaurants and likes to know what's hip on the latest gourmet food and wine, then this magazine might be for you.  If, however, you like to cook and know what you are doing and why you are doing it, try Cooks Illustrated instead. 
 god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, "then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after."  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.            
 I'm a huge Bone fan and I expected a great DVD and it has many performances but the catch is that THEY LIP SING on all there performances.  So when they perform on stage they basically sound the same as our CD's we have of them.  The only performance that they actually rap in this DVD is the 1996 MTV Awards and you can clearly tell the difference.  But to Bone's credit that performance was hot because they actually did rap.  If it wasn't for that great performance this would've got 1 star.  And the backstage seens were short and worthless basically.  So even if your a huge Bone fan its not really worth it cause of the reasons mentioned... 
 This album was largely responsible for a lot of nu metal, and it was the last gasp of this once great band. It's just not enjoyable. I actually like a lot of world music and tribal music, but if you want to hear tribal metal done right, listen to Neurosis.  I have a some Brazilian relatives, and I've heard from them that, in fact, a lot of Brazilian natives took issue with Max and the other members of Sepultura claiming Indian ancestry. Most of the guys in Sepultura are 100% Portuges 
 In taiji circles (no pun intended) it's common knowledge that Cheng taught select students a set of nei gong exercises that he found invaluable for taiji and even calligraphy.  William C.C. Chen mentions receiving this training from Cheng in his book about taiji's body mechanics, and there was a group of Malaysian students (some of whom still teach) who got this training.  Cheng didn't teach any of his American students this all-important nei gong (internal work) that is an essential part of taiji.  He was known rarely to discuss it.  Cheng was very secretive and he usually taught only the hand form.  The hand form without the nei gong is really only half an art (though some would say the nei gong is in the form).  Lowenthal learned the form and push hands, and had a great time, and his enthusiasm for Cheng comes through, as does much of Cheng's personality, which was wise, mischievous, and cultured.  So if you want to read a series of anecdotes, which is what the book contains, it's defintely worth buying--particularly if you're a Ching devotee.  But don't expect instruction.  It's not a textbook or manual, but a memoir.  
 Why so much praise??  I listened to this after so many other listenings of others and have to say that this version is truly awful.  The brisk speeds and lightness are totally unsuitable for the Mass in B.    There is no sense of cosmic grandeur and deep religiosity in Gradiner's version.  Truly dissapointing :(    Sure, some of the playing and singing is nice...but c'mon, period instruments and forces simply don't work and don't cut it for Bach's Mass in B.  For don't take my word for it, compare the Gardiner to other truly Great interpretations like Richter, Enescu, early Karajan, Scherchen, Guilini, Munchinger, and of course...Klemperer.   Gardiner is no match for these guys, his rendition is like a little stream along side a mighty ocean 
 I love all styles of music, but this... wow. Bought it after all the great reviews I read about this being the future of hard rock. It sounds like a Limp Bizkit cover band decided they were into Jon Bon Jovi and Guns 'N' Roses, changed styles but didn't have the chops. The "heavy" parts of this CD sound contrived, if you've heard any metal album in the last 20 years, you've heard all there is to be offered here. The "melodic" parts and solos sound like they were copied note-for-note by an ice cream truck. Overall, this is a bad hybrid of Bon Jovi and King Diamond; basically a re-hash of the past 20 years of hard rock/heavy metal, but without any fire, passion, or good execution to make it essential, or even worthwhile 
 I watched this movie in Religion and was dissapointed that it didn't follow the book. I read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available, but now seeing this one again (I'm pretty  sure I saw this before) I was annoyed at how much it changed the book. I think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties. The way Mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous. Also I don't like colin's strange fortune-teller like air. I had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and didn't even remotely resemble the children. Don't get this version if your a purist 
 Well I finally got around to reading this one.  No surprises.  It didn't explain anything new, answer any questions, or really fill in any gaps.  At least not to me.  But, that may be because it has been years since I read the first book in this series.  If the author is going to write, prequels or sequels, that's fine, but finish the story that was started a decade and a half ago.  There are thousands of storylines which can be developed into thousands of books just from the sheer scope of this series.  But, after over 15 years and about 8,000 pages later, I'm beginning to wonder if the Wheel is going to turn, ages pass, and the series come to a conclusion before the author dies.  I also doubt whether there are going to be any readers left to buy any of those off shoots after being burnt out on waiting ad infinitum for an end to this story 
 This is an exremely informative book.  It gives a history of the development of different cheeses, how to make many of them at home, the uses of various cheeses and recipes.  I got a little bogged down in the history of cheese, and don't really plan to make my own, but it was great for giving me more information about the uses of various cheeses.  If you want to learn about cheese, this is your book 
 I didn't understand why so many people liked this book many years ago when I read it, and I don't understand it any better today.  A lot of people said they thought it showed a good perspective of the corporate climate of the eighties, but that was only a tiny part of the novel.  Stick to Liar's Poker or Bombardiers for a better look.  Most of this novel is taken up by a ridiculous crime story.  There is not a single sympathetic character, so it is like spending however many hours in a room full of highly unpleasant people.  Not only are they un-likeable, they are also unrealistic and they make unbelieveable decisions.  The young, energetic stock trader who is all charm and confidence in one scene is suddenly socially awkward and unpopular in another scene.  The smart, tough lawyer sends his client off to a romantic tryst wearing a wire, even though any idiot would know the chances of his taking off his shirt would be very high.  Other characters are just caricatures: the overzealous civil-rights activist; the arrogant cop; etc.  I seem to be in the minority, but I thought this book was dismal.  Tom Wolfe should stick to non-fiction, which he does well 
 When I was given this book by a guy friend, I thought, why am I getting a book from a Jackie Collins type writer? I had heard of some of Sydney Sheldon novels and most of them seem like JC or Danielle Steel like potboilers that appealed to housewives. but I gave it a chance and I finished it two days later.   The book revolves around Tracey Whitley (as referred to as TW in the rest of the review), a well to do computer programmer who is engaged to a wealthy banker. However, due to the death of her mother a series of unfortunate events leads her to jail to attempted murder. She was setup.   The book then follows her in jail and then her release and revenge to those who put her there. The last part of the book leads to her new life as a Master Thief and romance of a roguish competitor.   The writing style of Sydney Sheldon is not unlike that of a soap opera. He provides you enough twists and turns to keep you interested, but ultimately his books are like Chinese Food. You consume it and then forget it. It is not because the book is badly written, but because the characters have major flaws.   The main flow of TW is the fact that she is given a cloak of invincibility. Everything she does is perfect, there is literally no suspense later on in the book when she goes to Europe of her getting caught. Her antagonists are idiots, the mafia are clowns and the genius tracking her is lame (and of course crazy). When she lives in a world of cartoonish badguys, of course, she'll come out on top.   Another problem is believability. If anyone thinks that this plot is even remotely possible, they need to get their head examined. TW goes from being a meek, young girl to a Master Thief who easily robs the Prado Museum, the Diamond Exchange in Amsterdam, tricks mobsters and master chess players at their game in less than 2 years. Simply ridiculous.   Associated with the above problem is that Sidney Sheldon does not respect the robbery crimes. They are given like 15 pages each and there is no detail to any of them. Some of them have interesting twists (like how she tricks a emerald dealer in London), but the Prado robbery, pure fantasy.   So maybe that is what Sheldon is getting at all along. He is not a technical writer, he is all about the Female Fantasy (meek, proper woman blossoming into a strong, sophisticated Master Thief who gets the finer things in life and the bad boy-whom she converts). In that case the book works, but from a realism stance, it is a wash....Rating: C 
 ENOUGH already. Yes, there were some interesting books, especially the earlier ones. But now that Auster has become a wealthy boy who can publish whenever he wants to, the public is getting loaded down with dreck. Enough already. You don't have to publish every single word you write 
 I struggle with this movie. I'm a die-hard fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme, so part of me really likes this movie. But the other part knows that this is a very subpar direct-to-video with a slow script, uninteresting characters, and horrendously bad acting (save for JCVD himself). Having said this, I can honestly reccomend it to fans of Van Damme. They will certainly have a good time watching the muscles from Brussles kick the tar out of some low-life hicks while drinking with his Indian buddy and pickin' up chicks. If this appeals to you, there shouldn't be any reason why you wouldn't like "Desert Heat." If even one of this doesn't sound good, stay far away 
 I've been a Bone fan for 12 years and Bizzy's first 3 solos are classics in my opinion. However, all of the fears that Speaking In Tongues brought to my mind were confirmed by this release. I still think that Bizzy's a uniquely talented and spiritual man, but he seems to have surrounded himself with wack producers and low expectations.  The repetative hooks and sparse verses are particularly disappointing 
 I'm going to make this review quick and to the point. I'm not going to include any synopsis or anything, I'm just gonna say this...This movie ended up in my Recommendations and when I read about it, it sounded kind of interesting despite all the negative reviews. This movie isn't disgusting, as some people have said it is...There is elements of nudity, sex, incest, s&m, and what have you...But it's not disgusting. The problem with the film is that it's dull. It's got a good cast including Isabelle Huppert (The Piano Teacher) and Louis Garrel (The Dreamers), but the film is just a boring mess. Even the sex scenes don't help it along. The plot is pretty stupid, I mean...This is really a waste of time.  GRADE:  
 I feel that this book is inadequte for students and professionals alike. It does not explain well how systems act in real life situations, like most academia book 
 This could be the dumbest movie ever made (and that's a bold statement to make when one considers that "Underworld" also exists).  Sadly, unlike "Underworld" there is no leather clad Kate Beckinsale to drool over. Instead, we are treated to a movie that could easily be confused for a map of the human DNA (but a human with an extra chromosome).  Jason Statham, so likable in "Snatch", "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "The Italian Job" is thoroughly wasted in this flick.  When he's not busy escaping from his tricked out house, driving fast whilst looking cool and beating up on clichéd Euro trash delivers lines such as "Rule #1. Never change the deal" and is expected to act with a straight face when he's the recipient of this type of drivel - "You're always complaining, except when we make love. Then you say nothing.".  Thankfully, the one thing Stetham is great at is keeping a straight face. But you won't.  Not if you have a brain, that is 
 Dear Sirs  As per your records I purchased the subscribtion to Essence Magazine on  08/19/2006. And today's date is November 6, 2006 and I've just recieved my first copy. I hope your company is keeping track of the delay in mailing this product. At this time I cannot give this product a rating. Respectfully, Elizabeth De Jesu 
 I was just waiting for this one to come out on DVD. Voila! It's here and I rent it. God, oh God, oh God - this film had so much potential and super actors, but the story was so full of holes, I could've drained my spaghetti in it! Not one single question regarding the plot of the film was answered!!! Not a single one! Since I refuse to watch it again, I now have to go to bed asking myself if I didn't perhaps miss something. Let's go on the record here: Acting - superb (Michael Caine's still got it); filming - superb; suspense - superb; action -superb; plot - as weak as my overcooked spaghetti. Everything was there but the plot. Like having my palate whet, without ever tasting the dish. Frustrating, hmmm 
 Seeing what's become of the rock and roll legends I remember from when we were much younger, I found very depressing. I'd rather remember them the way they were 40 yrs ago. Even Jerry Lee looked like he was ready for the nursing home 
 After reading probably 95% of the Star Wars adult novels in existence, I would have to say that this one is the worst Star Wars novels to date that I have read. The only one that surpasses it is Jedi Trial (and The Black Fleet Crisis is in the running in case you were wondering). To give you an idea of how bad this is, I will number each point (in no particular order). 1. I feel that, in general, the author threw information about the characters at you--such as how scary or courageous or dangerous these people are supposed to be (their actions never justify such a narration, however)--and expects you to believe it.  No actions are used to actually prove the author's claims.  For instance, the rulers are supposed to be so brave, but they certainly never give me the impression they actually are. 2. The 'love' story between Nate and Sheeka is so stupid and corny I just wanted to laugh (it is obvious when reading how Sheeka talks that a man wrote this novel). The author forces the chemistry between the two and doesn't spend enough time to cement their relationship. I still wonder how Sheeka got pregnant--the auther never even hints at any intimacy (other than a kiss) between the two (I would like a hint of their intimacy, not a full-blown steamy sex scene). 3. Kit Fisto, whom I had hoped to learn more about, drifts into the background and is so unimportant (fades behind Nate), I wonder why Steve even bothered to include him in here.  This point is probably the most annoying point in the book besides, maybe the next... 4. Asajj Ventress was NOT scary in the least. All she did was boast about how she would kill Obi-Wan and how much smarter she was than anybody else. Oh...I forgot! She also stalked Obi-Wan (real scary, huh?). I had so hoped, after seeing her in the Clone Wars animated shorts, that the author would use her to her fullest. I was wrong. 5. The battle sequences were too short. Typically I get tired of long battle sequences and wish the author would cut some material out but not this time. The author glosses over the lightsaber battles as if they are just fillers.  I want to know some of the dynamics, not a blow-by-blow and not a summary either. 6. I can't believe that Obi-Wan (who seems to be a big whiny know-it-all in this book--I half expect to see a line similary to the infamous 'I want to go to Toshee Station to pick up some power converters') would stoop to deception to trick the Cestians to turning to the Republic.  It just seems out of character to me.  Obi-Wan is very traditional, by-the-book.  Qui-Gon (and maybe Anakin) would stoop to deception; not Obi-Wan. 7. The story's ending was way too pat. It's like all of a sudden--boom! 8. Snoil, the Snail. I mean, come on! Are you that desperate for a new species?  Why can't authors reuse at least one alien from another book? There were a few bright points in the book: the aliens were cool, and I also liked how the author showed the point of view of a clone bred for war (but Karen Traviss does a much better job in Hard Contact). Also, the author writes a superb short story inclueded in the paperback version (I don't know why the short story was better than the novel but it was). But, overall, I would not recommend buying this book (unless in paperback or used or free) unless you are like me and trying to read all the Star Wars books. I would suggest that you check it out at the library or skip it.  You won't miss any important developments.  Recommended Reads: Jedi Apprentice Series, Thrawn Trilogy (absolute BEST!), some of the New Jedi Order (most notably Traitor), Shatterpoint, the MedStar duology (ER, anyone?), Yoda: Dark Rendezvous, Revenge of the Sith novelization, anything by Timothy Zah 
 I'm a Tami Hoag fan, but this book was weak at best.  The plot was predictable; the characters stereotypical and 2 dimensional.  The reparte between the characters was overly witty and contrived.  Hoag is definitely capable of a more intricate plot and better writing.  
 One way or another, this film will leave you slack-jaw.  Everything about this film is so quintessentially bad that it should be taught in film school as an example of what not to do.  It's so terrible that the subject matter becomes irrelavant.  See it 
 I bought this toy for my son to learn his multiplication and when i received it , it did not work.So i replaced the batteries, but once i popped them in, it begain malfunctioning and i couldnt shut it off unless i popped the batteries out. I returned it for an exchange and when i received the second one..it was the same thing with that one. Both times i received DUDs...toy sounds great, if it worked properly and didnt malfunction 
 I'll start with the positive:  The main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall, good-looking, smart, humble, etc.  The story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words.  In short, it was a competent work of fiction.   That's where my praise ends, because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas.  Sure, it's a work of fiction, no one is going to take it seriously, yada yada yada.  But that's not true, is it?  So many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers.  Alright, here are my problems with it:  First, politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power, but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state.  In Term Limits, Vince Flynn just beats you over the head with the "power corrupts" mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song, yet from the lips of the Marine Combat Veteran Congressman who is our protagonist.  You know what, though?  There are people in politics on BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE who really want to do what's right, who really are trying to make a difference for the positive, for this nation and the citizens.  In this book, however, the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough to make good decisions.  Second, murder is a viable answer.  This repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land.  Come on, get real.  This book touts a Special Forces Unit as being so committed to the Constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn't balance the budget.  And, they get away with it because it's really the right side to be on.  Murdering our leaders is the answer according to Vince Flynn.  Murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation, that being elections.  Elections apparently just get in the way.  Third, the balanced budget.  For years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget.  The book makes it the central theme.  Balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible.  It's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel.  A Coup!!!  Yet, when the conservatives did take power, despite Vince Flynn's prescient forecasting ability, they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn't flinch.  Even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility, they claim that NOW!!!!! the deficit isn't a big deal, that it's really just a function of the percentage of GDP and we ought to all forget about it.  This book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later.  It's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits.  Fourth, the good guys don't do bad things.  The Special Ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians.  The bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool.  Flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous, though shalt not?  - CV Ric 
 If you enjoy talking to your elderly Aunt, where a 30 second story turns into a 2 hour ordeal, then this is the book for you.  One idea per every 100 pages.  Stick to Murphy, Pring, Elder, and read the great book, "Technically Speaking."  Why do the other reviewers like this book?  I don't know either 
 I love Massive Attack. I hate, with a passion, 'Hymn of the Big Wheel'. Come on! Poor Horace Andy sounds like he's hurling in that song! I'm really trying to like this compilation. Some songs are wonderful (Dido, Gorillaz, Morcheeba, Royksopp, Badly Drawn Boy, Chem. Bros.), but then they want to include Goldfrapp's 'Utopia', which is a brilliant song, but the track included in the Ultra compilation is some [bad] mix that doesn't even begin to portray the beauty that is the original uncut song. WTF?! I feel lightly ripped-off, like I've been had. So, I'm going to edit my copy of Ultra Chilled Vol. 1 and burn my own edit (and include the original 'Utopia') so I can at least enjoy the good parts. But seriously, it shouldn't have to be like this 
 Review by Cory Rennison:  Major labels never cease to amaze me with their abilities to find the most generic bands out there and sign them. The kind folks over at Maverick Records have put out a new addition to the ongoing borefest that is mainstream music and their name is Stutterfly.  Stutterfly has thrown together 13 tracks of power chords, angst-ridden lyrics, and song titles that are laughable at best. Some things that did work for this band were the great sounding vocals, and the rare occasions on the disc when the band attempted to have some actual guitar riffs instead of power chords. There isn't really a whole lot of singing in metal these days, so it was kind of interesting hearing it on this CD, however instrumentally, there's just nothing special here.  With only a few key moments here and there, which are easily forgotten anyways, there's really no reason to waste your time or money on this album. Chances are I'll forget this band's name by next week 
 Had this set of speakers for close to a year now. They really are nothing special for the price. ONE problem is when running them on battery the signal seems to drift (if you lock in a signal at all)! They do come with power cord to plug each speaker into AC. I have outside wiring so this is no trouble. TWO if you walk between the transmitter and the speeakers the music cuts out.If you plan to buy these and run them on battery alone, and mounting them in a high traffic area (I mounted mine high above head level), DON'T PURCHASE THEM 
 Uh, classic or not, I don't care for this book.  It's yet another kill the mom book -just lioke all the disney stuff starts out.  I don't think this is a good choice for today's wee ones.  This is NOT what I'd choose to read at bedtime with my kids at all 
 What age range is the book appropriate for?  Poor Horton -- They beat him.  They maul him.  And try to cage him.  And threaten to boil the dust speck in Beezle-Nut juice just to teach him a lesson.  My poor 5 year old looked at me with sad eyes, and asked, "why?"  Not the best bed-time story 
 Interesting subject, but not a well-told.  Given the book's short length, about 220 pages, he devotes a surprising amount of the book to backgrounding.  In a book of this length, you really have to cut to the chase.  For instance, we get 20 pages, or a little less than 10% of the book, describing the history of the Great Eastern, the massive ship that finally laid the cable.  And a number of pages devoted to the family of Cyrus Field, the man who came up with the whole idea.  Why?  Not every fact, newpaper article, and speech that a researcher finds is relevant.  Needs focus 
 Although well-researched, this book is really little more than a book of quotations lifted from several primary sources. The result is rather monotonous and fails to provide the detail and context that makes those primary sources so informative. A much better idea is to simply read the memoirs written by the men who were actually there (and there are plenty of them). They provide much greater insight into the life of a German Landser than this second-hand account 
 The customers and buyers that I deal with would throw me out the door if I  attempted these techniques.  Mr. Ley implies that by simply using certain  magic phrases, you are able to get a customer emotionally involved or upset  enough to buy from you.  I wish it were that easy 
 From its boring title to its cast of cliched southern rednecks, the Empty Chair disappoints from the very beginning.  The storyline about a teen killer/kidnapper obsessed with insects is interesting, but the story quickly dissolves into a half-baked tale of southern intrigue that never offers any excitement.  Deaver tried to save the book by pulling about a dozen rabbits out of a hat near the end of the novel, but many of these surprises and plot twists make no sense at all, and after the third or fourth one, the reader just gets tired of the whole thing.  Deaver also tries to wrap up every plot conflict with a neat little bow at the end, but he leaves out most of the explanations which only leaves readers scratching their heads and wondering what happened.  Try the earlier books in this series, both of which were far better reads 
 Ok, check it out, there's two Jack Blacks. One is the guy from Tenacious D, you see him all the time. He's funny and childish and insane. Then there's the other Jack Black. He's the evil creature who pervades films like Shallow Hal and King Kong, whose only humorous lines are the ones that are funny by accident. Well, as long as you aren't fat and don't feel patronized by Gweneth presuming to know what it's like not to be desired all her life (ha), then by all means suspend all disbelief, logic, and brain power and watch this dumb movie. Gweneth's fat suit is actually pretty convincing, although most of the movie she's played by an actual fat chick...who by the way should have just been left in, without the whole "ha ha the dude thinks she's skinny" nonsense. Obviously, a film about a dude trying to cope with dating a big girl would have a lot more resonance if: a) He weren't brainwashed b) His fat girlfriend wasn't replaced by a twiggy blond chick  c) The movie didn't throw ridiculous concepts your way (like a guy could have sex with a 300 lb woman without realizing it) d) Tony Robbins was in no way involved whatsoever  I knew I was slumming it when I saw this movie.  But I'm not sure what the message of this film is.  Jack Black's character is decent, considerate, great with kids and perfect in every way.  Oh, except he's really shallow for no dicernable reason, other than his dad's dying words were for him to go out and chase tail.  The weird part is that Hal's not a bad person.  The movie beats you over the head showing you he's the nicest guy on on the face of the Earth, so you can't really laugh at him looking like an idiot.  Rosemary is so fat she has superpowers.  Her butt actually creates typhoons (I wonder if that has military applications?).  Suddenly, Hal mistakes ugly pimply girls for supermodels and evil skanks for old shrews.  Tony Robbins brainwashed him, the fiend! When Hal finally realizes this he decides to (ooh big spoiler) love Rosemary anyway, and learns a VALUBLE LESSON.  Along the way there are a ton of cliches like people thinking he's dating Rosemary just because her dad happens to be his boss, and a sexy neighbor in his building who starts to get the hots for him when she sees how non-judgemental he is dating a fat girl ('cause that would make any woman melt).  Of course there's requisite best friend, played by Jason Alexander, who is repulsed by fat people and plots to get Hal to dump her.  Then again, the friend is a complete troll, so I don't know why Hal would want him around.  And to insult us further, they force some burned kids on us at the hospital to strike a SERIOUS note about how true beauty is on the inside. Too...many...public...service...messages! PICK...ONE..!!   But brain-dead writing aside, Paltrow really sells her performance when they actually show her in the fat suit (despite Gweneth's postering when this film was first released). Regardless of its clumsy benevolence, I have to rate this as a romantic comedy. And for that, I give it a rating of totally unremarkable. Nice gesture, Farelly brothers. Not to be bothered with 
 I got this 1 month ago and I started out loving it. But when it started raining outside, the backboard got ruined because it was made out of paper so customers, don't buy this hoop. Look for another one 
 An attack on the modern intellectual world by a leading light of the conservative "fifties" - that ghastly era that lasted from about 1946 to about 1963. Barzun is upset that the lower orders are no longer deferential to their social superiors, that women and minorities don't settle for crumbs, that students question what their professors say, that universities are not reserved for a small minority of WASP spoiled brats, and that everyone doesn't agree that imperialism is a great project. This is a man who wrote about half a century ago that, walking through the streets of New York City, he was distressed at having to listen to the "Bronx whine" and the "Alabama bleating" of the lower classes. I wonder what groups he could have been thinking about? Thank God that time has passed Barzun and his like by; they were still running American universities, or at least many of them, as recently as the early 1970's. This book is unlikely to appeal to anyone whose thinking is more advanced than that of G.W. Bush. For everyone else it is useful only as a historical document showing what the United States used to be like 
 If you want your dogma reinforced then this is a great book. It blazes through philosophical arguments with proposterous nerve.  example 1. The problem of evil is solved thus: "And God has done something about the problem of evil. He has done the most dramatic, costly, and effective thing possible by giving his Son to die for evil men."  example 2. To John Wisdoms damning parable, the book argues: "For in Christianity we do not have merely an allegation that the garden of this world is tended by a loving Gardener; we have the actual, empirical entrance of the Gardener into the human scene in the person of Christ (cf. John 20: 14,15), and this entrance is verifiable by way of His resurrection."   All of the arguments assume the ignorant position. The argument from design is entertained in the most ridiculous manner -arguing from the specific to the general. Reality is simple -we are here because things are the way they are -if they weren't, we wouldn't be here. Too many leaves in the teacup being read by those who want to see things that are not there. I'm afraid for humanity if they think this is knowledge.  
 What a bunch of high school hallway gossip! The author does not know the difference between white and albino! The 'genetics' discussions on color (which includes people, chickens, horses, and dogs - all of it suspect) and mutts vs. purebred dogs are total claptrap! I confess, I couldn't get past page 87 when the author explains that 'one of the reasons wolves turned into dogs was that nursing human mothers probably adopted orphaned wolf cubs and nursed them at their breasts along with their human babies.' WHAT?? A waste of my hard-earned $. Having read those parts I cannot believe anything that went before or that follows, not that I'm reading any further. How is a multi-published author allowed to put such uneducated 'information' into print? And now she's influenced readers -- a terrible situation. Publisher, where are your pre-publication reviews? Shame on you for allowing this ignorant speculation to be published! 
 i bought this book/dvd in the hope it would actually take me through various pieces for the classicl guitar. instead it spends overlong on things like nails, scales  and arpeggios....having the lessons set in mocked up gym was so cheesy as to be embarrassing. all we got was the maestro zipping through some fine pieces...what i wanted was step by step instruction on how to play them!!! dont buy unless you have the intellectual capacity of a boiled potat 
 20 years ago, there was a terrible accident in the mine on Valentine's Day. The following year one of the miners, Harry Warden, takes a terrible revange on those responsible for the accident. Since that day, there is no celebration of Valentine's Day in the little town Valentine's Buff. Until now (that is 1981). But Harry Warden seems to have returned to stop the celebration.  The music as music is quite good, but it doesn't lead the film in any direction, so it's not helping. The story is recycled, which is good, but could have been much more minimalistic. Why not just have the party and let the miner kill the kids? And trying to put a twist to the story by "explaining" things is seldom very helpful. The murderar places human hearts in Valentine boxes which is distasteful but not really scary.   A variation on the holiday theme, that could have been a bit more focused. 
 To be fair to the editor, women are doing many things in their 30s, so it's probably difficult to turn this topic into a cohesive book. Having said that, this book was disappointing. Some of the women have interesting stories to tell, no doubt about it (example: one of the authors is the granddaughter of the Rosenbergs, executed for treason) but with most of essays, it isn't clear what the heck the stories have to do with being in your 30s ... similar essays could have been written in 20s or 40s, or even other decades. I got the feeling these were interesting authors who were struggling to adapt pre-existing work or themes into the "30s" theme. There were a few standouts in this book, but overall I thought the writing was uneven. If you are interested in books regarding being single in your 30s, and children and whether to have them, etc., I strongly recommend "Maybe Baby", an anthology of essays by writers which is much better written 
 I bought this camera to mainly use the Digital macro mode, it worked great for several months, now it will not lock focus, this camera is very frustrating, every picture that I take I have to edit to lighten the picture, I tried just about every setting to get the pictures to come out, to no avail, I am a commercial real estate appraiser, so I have taken close to 2000 pictures with this camera, and just about every one I had to lighten, now the Macro mode wont work, I will not buy another cannon product ever again!! 
 This is another wooden, easily solved Krentz book.  What has happened to the author who wrote such classics as Absolutely, Positively or Trust Me?  These last few years have been nothing but one formulaic, clunky novel after another, with tiresome characters and easily-predicted plotlines.  I want the excitement and energy of her ealier novels, not some rehashed pulp with her name attached to boost sales.  I hate to say it, but I think I'm about ready to stop reading Krentz and look elsewhere for my romance jollies.  Don't waste your time with this book--go back and read some of her stuff from the nineties & see what a really well-written, exciting, and romantic novel can be like when it's done as well as Ms. Krentz can do 
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 Wow..What lies.  I NEVER hear any kind of news channel favor the left...NEVER.  The media, especially FOX News, has a right wing bias..its 100% FACT, proven beyond any reasonable doubt.  The republican right wing NUT JOB Wackos INVENTED the concept of a liberal bias in the media for political advantage, and its simply not true.  Republicans are the worst thing that could ever happen to this country, all they know how to do is lie, cheat, steal, and profit off of the suffering of others.  Oh yeah, and these religious wing nuts are delusional bigots who think some guy waved a magic wand and invented the universe.  Give me a break.  This book is 100% lies.  I actually burned the book after I read it...(Notice the lack of credible sources).  Good job republicans...Continue to make up news...the people are catching on!  
 The publisher should be convinced that the automatic spell checker should not be so heavily relied upon.  The cover art is an expression of how an armchair graphic artist can be innovative with Photoshop.  If a book of such high esteem be put out for public enrichment its presentation should not be so insincere 
 This book sucks so bad.  All of the redundant crap that everyone makes  kids read about the Holocaust is so depressing.  We all understand that  WWII was a terrible thing and that the Axis forces did hideous things to  Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, Poles, etc.  Do we have to keep reading about  it?  I feel like my brain has been drained!  It's all so depressing, so  negative.  Move on, people.  I might sound insensitive...sure, this was an  atrocious thing and deeply affected those involved, but move on.  My priest  says that we bear our own crosses.  The Holocaust is NOT going on now.  We  need to learn from what happened (I have!) and MOVE ON 
 After some investigative reporting by the media, it was discovered that this alleged "true story" of a Holocaust survivor was anything but. The facts? Binjamin Wilkomirski is actually Swiss-born Bruno Grosjean Doessekker, and his experience was about as real as that of the supposed "fellow survivor" who corroborated his story, Laura Grabowski.  How did Grabowski play an indirect role in unmasking the author? She claimed to be an orphan who suffered torture at the hands of Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele and was later adopted by an American couple, only to have these stories be exposed as equally untrue (her childhood photos show a happy, healthy American girl w/not even hints of the emaciated sate commonly associated w/those who spent time in concentration camps). Additionally, she was revealed to actually be Lauren Stratford, author of the equally fictitious-but-presented-as-a-true-story "Satan's Underground", which detailed her alleged involvement in Satanism and the sexual abuse she endured from the time she was a young girl (something she'd also had a history of lying about since her late teens); as it turns out, "Grabowski" was actually the surname of her maternal grandparents.  Don't the Wilkomirskis and Grabowskis of this world realize that their exploitation of one of the most despicable events in history is not only self-indulgent and unbelievably selfish, but giving credibility to those misguided Holocaust-denying racist groups? Such lies will allow these scumbags to convince the lesser-informed folk out there that the attempted extermination of an entire race was also nothing but lies, which I'm sure never occured to these self-indulgent storytellers as they proceeded to betray countless REAL survivors, who have already suffered enough as it is 
 I had a good laugh when reading your reviews of a Cliffs Notes.  I mean....oh, man....*laughs*.  The book is great and I can't believe you even bothered to pick up an abreviated version.  It might be several  hundred pages, but it's a page turner.  So, expand your mind 
 As a person who used to see Pat Green in Texas on a regular basis I am very sad to witness this progression everyone talks about.  There are close to 100 bland country singers belting out the "Nashville" sound.  Where songs are written in a cubicle on music row.  Pat Green has morphed into Kenny Chesney with sleeves on his shirt (thank god!).  Lets hope Pat Green takes a trip back to Gruene Hall and gets back in touch with the sound that made him a legend in Texas 
 Who knows why Ruelle felt compelled to write this book?  He makes a lot of sweeping statements about fields he doesn't have a mastery over.  Only  tangentially does he bring in chaos, and he doesn't bother staying on any  point long enough to add any insight on any of the issues presented.  It's  such a weak book that it doesn't even have "brainstorming value"  -- the collection of ideas is limited in breadth and depth.  Perhaps in  1991 it was fashionable to come up with books like this; having read it in  1999, I found little of value 
 I actually had to send this back cause of the size.  They run really small.  
 I listened to this book on tape during a long car trip. Instead of offering real vocational advice, as the title seemed to promise, all it presented was a series of biographical sketches and interviews with high-powered people who changed careers. That's inspirational as far as that goes, but it doesn't really provide any useful information that the individual reader could apply to his own life 
 A friend of mine has Zombies!!!, also by Twilight Creations.  I've played it a few times, and found it pretty enjoyable.    Zombietown is sort of a followup to this in some ways, and tries to expand the strategy of the game somewhat.  Unfortunately, it ends up far too confusing and complicated to make for fast gameplay (it's often very slow, in fact), and the strategy is more shallow than Risk.    Ya know the stereotypically confusing instructions of insert Tab A into Slot B?  That's pretty much what the instructions to this read like.  They're fairly poorly written to boot.  There were also a couple problems we ran into the rules didn't seem to cover.  I can't recall them off the top of my head, and they didn't come up very often, but it was still irritating.  Overall, definetly not reccomended.  At $40 in stores, and $35 off Amazon, it's also a HUGE ripoff.  What do you get in the box?  Like 100 tiny army men-esque figures, a couple of packs of cards, and a laminated piece of cardboard.  I understand why it is expensive, as I'm sure this was a low budget item and such, but Zombies!!! was much less expensive.  
 While I love Dennis Lehane, his prose his timing and generally his stories; these stories get more and more depressing as you move along.  
 The shelves are not sturdy and the pockets are very small...don't waste your money, it's not worth it! 
 Blind Alley has similar themes.  I found it more enjoyable than Final Target 
 This DVD was awful.  Its impossible to follow.  The instructors don't break down any of the steps.  I have a little bit of dance background and I couldn't pick up any of the dances.  I would recommend one of Shawn Trautman's DVD's instead.  You will find it much less frustrating 
 The premise is great - man on a mission to save his long-lost love on a dying world - but the plot went downhill from there, at least for me, and the ending was completely unsatisfying. There was no real resolution, and what does the hero have left at the end? I didn't like his love interest at all, and she seemed vapor-brained to me - putting herself into a culture where she was essentially a sex slave to both her mate and his bondsman. Ick. George R.R. Martin is a brilliant writer, but this left me cold 
 The other people rating this movie are killing me...I purchased this one expecting it to be even better than part 3...and I was disappointed...I am a very forgiving horror movie fan...but this is absolutely the worst...mortality rate low...acting is a great representation of the new gutless, soulless, incompetent, and laughable horror style...high production...low setting...the intricate plot and horrifying aura is missing that is classic of the older genre of horror films...people just rated this one higher because it has Naomi Watts from "The Ring" in it...who is a horrible actress anyway...they are pseudo-horror fans just following the trends and not differentiating some type of genuine analysis of their own...part 3 is better with unforgivingly amounts of gore and a reasonably wide range of diversity of mortality...it's awesome...this one's a flop...you can afford to skip it in the series...to all pseudo-horror fans: stick to reviewing romantic comedies, soap operas, sitcoms, and any other elements of  regurgitated compost 
 They chosen Robin Williams to be in a Disney movie and this movie turned out to be very corny. Special effects are dull though. If I were a kid I would probably like this movie but now that I'm 15 I think it's stupid. I think I saw it in theater when I was 8 and I don't remember much of it but I think it's not in stores anymore out to buy because people don't really care much about this movie anymore. I don't care about it either. I'm glad this movie is out of stock and it should be. It is very boring! 
 If you can divorce yourself from the lyrics (and show) that really says nothing... and says it quite crassly, the music is amazing.    I believe the composer is extremely talented and could make a competition quality arrangement of "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall". Too bad this set of music doesn't say something equally important.  Perhaps next time. 
 The only extraordinary thing about this film is how OW could take such a fascinating subject and drain the life out of it.  I found myself wanting this to be over about halfway through (after I dozed off).  Don't be fooled by the other review here.  They are the true fakes (if you know what I mean).  Save your money and save your time 
 After reading A Brief History of Time I decided that I wanted to learn more about Stephen Hawkings himself and how he became who he is today. I picked up this book written by Kitty Ferguson, which is claimed to be a biography and started reading it. After about twenty pages she was done talking about his life and started talking about his theories. This was disappointing to me because I thought the book was a biography.   As I continued reading I became somewhat confused while she told about Hawkings discoveries. The explanations were little or none in trying to get the reader to understand the ideas. It did not help that there were very few small illustrations that were in the book to go along with her explanations. If there were highly detailed color illustrations such as those in A Brief History In Time, it might have been much easier to understand.  I did enjoy the beginning of the book where Kitty goes into detail about the beginning of Hawkings life but I feel like it was just an overview of how he became who he is today. I would not recommend this book, instead I would recommend A Brief History In Time because it is much easier to understand because it has great illustrations and is not so mathematical 
 Lucy Cousins has a great idea with "Maisy Goes Swimming" but did 'undies' have to be included? But as gross as the book was, the illusrations were quite good, so I gave it another star. Let's just hope  that the subject of undergarments are not mentioned in future books. Thank  you 
 Bennett makes few if any good points in this book about the problems our culture faces.  Most of the book is spent showing how many people were "critics" and how he showed them who was boss.  Bennett criticizes anyone who wishes to include diversity in the American life: through "controversial" art which he deems a "bad joke" simply because it may shock viewers, through a desire for schooling that does not impose Christian ideals upon its students by force, through courses that don't only include dead white men of the western world, etc.  Bennett's argument is that his racist, homophobic, beauraucratic, Christian-supremicist version of morality is the only feasible one and must be imposed upon all children in any institution of education.  He spends most of the book laughing off his critics and indignantly ignoring any of their points, casting them off as just being jealous that their plans aren't as good as his.  Yet he thinks vouchers will help poor students, that an abolishment of affirmative action will help minorities, and that "beheading" drug dealers is morally plausible.  The section on drugs has a little bit of insight, but the books few good points are obscured by his blatant arrogance and conservative ideals 
 I used this text for pre-med biology course-- I was simulataneously taking Biochemistry as well, but more on that later.  The text, while not overwhemingly as detailed as other reviewers write, was all in all okay, but fell short in many areas.  One of them is the distinct typographical and grammatical errors that riddled, what seemed, to be the only chapters we covered.  There were many sentences that were run-ons, which disrupted the learning and flow of the text (and, in my opinion, a textbook backed by such a major publisher as this, errors like that are out of the question).  Sometimes, for instance in the TCA chapter, I felt that the material presented on Oxidative Phosphorylation seemed out of order, and just a bit too condensed.  The photosynthesis chapter was utterly horrible.  The exercises at the end were poorly written, and seemed to ask esoteric questions about common topics.  The answers to these questions were esoteric still.  I felt that the only saving grace about this were the wonderful pictures: I liked how each chapter opened up an exhaustive diagram.  Other than that, this is book pretty much only a decent cell bio book, but no biochemistry one 
 I'm sorry to be the party pooper here, but this is an awful book, which might not be the writer's fault, since it's based on a terrible song.  The activities along the way are fun enough. But if a child's book is supposed to be fun, it's also supposed to teach little life lessons.  What does this one teach?  My 3 year old is terrified of the book.  He says the bear is mean.  I say, "Why?"  "Because he looks big and scary."  So my kid has learned that big, scary-looking, unknown things are mean (if you haven't read the book, the bear does nothing "mean"--he's just hanging out in his cave).  More--if they're provoked and they chase you, it's because they're mean (not because a bunch of kids provoked them).  At the same time, my kid loves Shrek, and I love the fact that it teaches him to look beyond surface appearance, to face a big, scary thing and learn about it--not to call it mean when you don't know it, not to bother it and run.  The book's just screwy.      
  After reviewing the novel, Teacher: The One Who Made A Difference by Mark Edmunson, I would give it two stars.  This book was about a boy and his high school memeories and how in the end a teacher made a difference on his future.  This book only relates to the teacher every so often, until the last chapter, where finally the author lets us the reader know how his future was affected by the teacher.  Throughout the book I felt like the reading was pointless and had no relation to the title.  I learned more about the football plays than I did about the author being affected by his teacher.  The good thing though, was some of the stories were interesting but at points they were hard to understand.  The author would be explaining one thing and then quickly switch over to another, making the book at some points have no organization.  Also the use of big words seemed sort of ridiculous just because the tone of the book was so casual.  The words were very out of place.  His use of analogies with philosophers and characters in the book was also something that kept my interest.  If it wasnt't for the few funny stories and the intersting analogies I feel I would have tossed this book away a long time ago.  
 Perhaps Jacqueline Rose should instead of pretending to analyze and understand the collective efforts of tens of thousands of individual Jews, many of whom sacrificed their lives to help establish and maintain the Jewish state in face of unrelenting Arab hostility, analyze herself? Perhaps she should ask herself why she finds it necessary to ' identify with the aggressor' the Arab majority in the Middle East, and to vilify and defame the element in the situation( the Jewish people) for whom Peace is the first value and has always been a fundamental aim? Perhaps she should ask why she gives herself the right and authority to persecute the persecuted, to show sympathy for those who have engaged in the most evil kinds of cruelty in aiming to kill innocent, men, women and children?  And perhaps all those who identify with her, who see justice and justification in the acts of suicide- bombers, Islamic fundamentalist terrorists, extreme leftist anti- Semites, neo- Nazis and the whole panoply of those seeking to deligitimize Zionism and undermine the Jewish state should too ask themselves why it is they so much want to hate, to destroy, to demonize the state of the Jewish people?  Ms.Rose. Have you no shame?  
 Tao Teh Ching is a monumental work.  Unlike other religious texts, the Tao Teh Ching is barely 5000 letters spread over 81 single-page poetic passages.  You can probably read thru it in a couple hours or less.  But for the serious reader, it can take a lifetime of study and contemplation.  In ancient times, scholars in China and Korea really did spend a lifetime on this one text, not only sudying, but transcribing it, discussing it, and abiding by its tenets in their daily lives.  I've myself pored over it many times in Chinese, Korean and now English, and every time I read it I cannot but be amazed by the wisdom of Lao Tse (or, as some allege, the group of people who contributed to this text).  The problem with English, or I suppose any language not associated with Chinese, is that it is almost impossible to translate Tao Teh Ching with sufficient coherency.  Chinese words are each and all very efficient, in that virtually every single "letter" is replete with meaning.  Therefore, whereas the Chinese may use 10 words to describe something, English might require 10 times that words to adequately translate the meaning.  For example, in the second passage, third stanza, the translated text says, "therefore, the Sage manages his affairs without Ado."  What does "without Ado" mean?  In chinese this is stated in two letters as "Mu Wi" - non-action.  It does not mean to sit back and not participate or instigate any activity.  Rather, "Mu Wi" means doing things in a very natural, spontaneous way that is not forced, does not create conflict and has no secular motives.  As there are no secular motives behind the action, it is as if the Sage does not "act" in the way other poeple act.  His actions are like breathing, and almsot imperceptible; thus it is as if he does not act.  Concepts like "Mu Wi" and "Mu Ji" - non-knowledge - abound in Tao Teh Ching.  These cannot simply be translated away with a couple english words.  In short, a Tao Teh Ching ranslation requires pages and pages of footnotes to accurately reflect the rich meaning behind every passage.  Moreover, many passages can be read in more than one way.  In fact, different translations sometimes say radically different things about the same passage precisely because of this ambiguity.  Any serious translation of Tao Teh Ching should point these out.  Tao Teh Ching is very concise, and written in a poetic style.  But unless you are versed in ancient Chinese language and tomes, you should really consult the literally thousands of guides that scholars wrote over the years to help you read thru the text.  Tao Teh Ching is not some kind of Buddhist sutra that you can just recite over and over without knowing what it means.  It is deeply profound and rich with hidden subtexts.  In China and Korea many of these guides - some of them more than a thousand years old - still survive.  I've yet to find an enligsh guide.  But I am sure they exist.  PLease find them; refrain from reading the translation by itself, for most times all you will see are a jumble of meaningless words 
 Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked 
 i have been listening to industrial since the early 90's, skinny puppy, thrill kill, REVCO, and i am still heavily into industrial, android lust, i, parasite, ect.  I bought this CD to maybe check out some enw industrial bands, man was i suprised at what they are passing off as industril, this is nothing more than the cheesiest, rave till dawn, K-mart clearance bin techno i have ever herd, with vocals on top, this is NOT INDUTSRIAL music, industrial music is dark and noisy and intense, not trance with vocals.  If you are looking for some real industrial, email me, i will point you in the right direction, if you are new to industrial DO NOT BUY THIS CD, it is not industrial 
 This coffee machine brews the weakest coffee I've ever had- doesn't grind the beans well and to clean it makes you wan't to store it in the garbage  can.  That's what I did I'm going back to the melitta machine toda 
 The author comes off as a whining, unhappy camper about having to grow up in what he considers a 'stifling' church environment; further apalled by the Church Founder's belief, in that it (the Worlwide Church Of God) was God's True Church through the ages, right on up to the present 'end time'. Feazell spends a good amount of time giving his negative opinions on Herbert W. Armstrong,the Church's actual teachings, and a general trashing and somewhat of a misreprentation of the general denomination as a whole, labeling it a 'cult'...and further damning its Pastor General as a "heretic", despite the Church's humanitarian works, publishing, Colleges and international outreach for world peace over the past seven decades under the leadership of H.W. Armstrong. Since Armstrong's death in 1986, Feazell and his cohort Joseph Tkach Jr. seem to be having a field day jumping up and down on his remains, and writing books on how great it feels to be loosed from having to keep the apostolic Holy Days, sabbaths, ten commandments (which, in his estimation are now the 'ten suggestions') and general lifestyle of this 7th Day Church Of God denomination. Mr. Feazell apparently does not speak for all the Church membership, as over 100,000 members left and formed various smaller independent Church Of God conferences throughout the United States...and continuing the legacy and apostolic, traditional Christian system of worship restored by Herbert W. Armstrong in 1927. Recommended reading: "Autobiography of Herbert W. Armstrong"; "Mystery Of The Ages"; "The Incredible Human Potential" 
 The first book, "Starfish" was amazing, just a great read. This last book is horrible! Confusing, pointless, and extremely degrading, I wish I had never read it. I agree whole heartedly with "aisian film c" above! The rape and torture of one of the more sympathetic characters is what really pushed this book into the crapper for me 
 This is a book that could (should?) have faded into history without being a great loss to the world. Yes, there are a few interesting bits of political philosophy, but they're far and few between, and mainly either just thrown out as Montesquieu's personal opinions with little to no evidence or examination, or flimsily based on historical examples. As a reader, I didn't find most of his arguments (where he didn't seem to be contradicting himself, which happens frequently) very convincing. This was obviously written with the 18th century French salon crowd in mind, and reads as such. I'm sure it provided a lot of aristocrats with conversation fodder to make them appear intelligent and educated at the time, but these days it just seems like an antiquated bit of history.  He claims the book has to be read as a whole to see the structure and his overall goal; well, I did read the whole book and at the end couldn't see an overarching structure at all. The work just seemed like a long, rambling, unorganized mess. The only people I might really recommend this to are people interested in Greek, Roman, and French history (especially legal history), but not to people interested in political science or philosophy.  Bump this one to the bottom of your list of classics on historical thought, there are much more interesting reads out there 
 I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up...... 
 I have read all of the Artimis Fowl Books and loved them until now  I was disapointed with this one, and not found Artmis unusaly irritating, but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good.   Truth be told I was younger when I read the first three, but still I can reread them and enjoy them (as I did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris) so if you want my advice then I suggst you don't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace 
 INVOLVEMENT AFTER 11 NOVEMBER 1975 After independence, Cuban forces and an unlimited number of Russian armamaents streamed into Angola and completely took over the military function from MPLA. FOXBAT, strengthened by ZULU, had to contend with heavy 122mm fire on 13 November 1975, after which this battle group also requested artillery from the RSA. While the build-up of Cuban forces took place mainly in the Quibala area, the South African supported Unita and FNLA concentrated on the retention of their traditional areas of influence. Action in which these forces were concerned took place mainly in no-man's land between Quibala and Santa Comba. The need to hold the territory resulted in an escalation of South African involvement and the creation of additional battle groups to such an extent that the South African involvement just before withdrawal stood at just under 2000 men (logistics element included). As a counter- move to the Cuban build-up and especially to the 122mm rocket launchers, 140mm guns were brought into the struggle. This caused chaos among the Cuban ranks. The following events are exceptional:   Bridge 14 To deny the Cuban forces access to the anti-communist line of defence, the Battle of Bridge 14 took place on 9 December 1975 in the Catofe area. During this battle, the battle group FOXBAT dealt the Cubans a shattering blow. FOXBAT comprised 3 FNLA/Unita companies, a company of South African infantry and an armoured car squadron, supported by eight 140mm and four 38mm guns, a platoon of mortars and an engineer element, all South Africans. The Cuban/MPLA force consisted of a battalion of Cubans, an MPLA battalion and a mixed supporting battalion with 122mm rocket launchers, artillery and mortar support. The battle raged from 9 December 1975 to 12 December 1975 and yielded the following results:  i. 200 Cubans dead  ii. 200 MPLA dead  iii.10 x 76mm guns seized  iv. 22 x 122mm mortars seized  v. 4 x 122mm rocket launchers destroyed  vi. 1 x 122mm rocket launcher seized  vii. 4 South Africans dead    Occupation of the Salazar Bridge A newly appointed battle group, known as ORANGE, comprising a Unita battalion, an armoured car squadron, a company of South African infantry and artillery occupied the Salazar Bridge over the Cuanza River, north of Mussende, the northern border of the Unita area, on 12 December 1975.  Apparently the South Africans lost air superiority. Below are records of South African/Cuban air engagements. On 6 November 1981 then-Major Johan Rankin of the South African Air Force (SAAF) shot down a MiG-21MF (the SAAF identified it as a "MiG-21Bis"), flown by Teniente Danacio Valdes, over Angola with 30mm gunfire while flying a Mirage F-1CZ. It was the SAAF's first victory in air-to-air combat since Korea. Almost a year later on 5 October 1982, the second aerial combat of the war took place. The duo formed by Tenientes Raciel Marrero Rodriguez and Gilberto Ortiz Perez, clashed with a couple of Mirage F1s, again under the leadership of Johan Rankin; Marrero's MiG-21 was lightly damaged by the 30mm gunfire. The MiGs broke contact and returned to their base in Lubango, without encountering any further problems. The South Africans however, declared that Rankin had shot down one of the MiG-21s and that the other had crashed after being damaged, two supposed MiG loses that never took place. The only recorded aerial victory for the Cuban MiG-21s occurred on 3 April 1986 when a pair of MiG-21MFs intercepted two C-130s reportedly carrying cargo to UNITA. They shot down one and the other escaped seriously damaged. According to South Africa (and the International Air Transport Association) they actually shot down a civilian C-130 registered to the Angolan government airline.  The best-documented loss of a Cuban-flown MiG-21 over Angola was on 28 October 1987 when an armed two-seater MiG-21UM was downed by ground fire near Luvuei. The two crewmembers successfully ejected and were captured by UNITA 
 I'm an expert paint-by-number painter. This kit is horrible! The template looks nothing like the original art, the colors are all primary colors, its pretty much a cheesy kids's quality paint by number kit. Rose Art should be ashamed to put out such a trashy kit. Note to Rose Art: Please put a picture of the finished art on the COVER, and not an original work by the author, its a cheap, misleading marketing ploy to get us to purchase this low-quality kit. 1 star. Disappointing. 
 It turns out the metal in the stems irritates my wife's ears.  I assume that the stems must not be white gold?  Other than that they are as expected.  Not perfect, but not bad for the price 
 On this recording Joni Mitchell sounds like she's singing in a bad piano bar. Never thought she'd be a lounge singer. I've listened to this CD only once because I want to remember her as the Joni Mitchell of the sixties and seventies 
 Stupid, pointless and useless. Hand held camera about made me seasick. Learned nothing except that Parker had lost a lot of weight, apparently 
 Being a huge fan of Golden Age mystery fiction and also an admirer of Gypsy Rose Lee, I was very eager to read this book.  I also have the film "Lady of Burlesque" with Barbara Stanwyck, which follows the book fairly closely and which I thorougly enjoy.  However, although Gypsy Rose Lee "stars" in the story which involves murders among the striptease acts in an Opera House, the writing is rather uninvolving and I who read voraciously had trouble staying interested.  I also confess to being rather annoyed at the petty squabbling between the women which fails to capture the friendships that also develop between women.  In fact, the characterizations remain on an extremely superficial level and the few colorful instances (almost "pre-code" sort of moments) do not rescue the story or make it any more compelling.  I found myself bored and wanting to read something else.  It's a pity, because I truly did want to like it and the premise was promising.  My conclusion:  Gypsy Rose Lee was a very beautiful woman and I imagine a powerful and provocative performer with some class to boot, but she is not a great writer by any stretch of the imagination.  Being a great performer or leading a colorful life does not necessarily mean that you can write; writing is a whole other art form and too many people think it requires no particular skill since one is not required to do eye-high kicks or hit high notes.  They're absolutely wrong, as misfires such as this demonstrate (although I've read far worse).    A disappointment, but may fill the bill for someone looking for a light read.  To use an apt cliche:  mediocre fare.  
 This book is about 100 pages of big type. Just a bunch of hearsay stories thrown together with no attempt made to validate them. It may be a good read for middleschool level reader; but it will never be worth the ... that I had to pay for it. This is a 3$ book that you buy at a book fair in a Junior High School 
 I was so happy to order this. It hasn't even been put together yet... in box for two weeks. They sent the wrong hardware with it. I emailed them 2 times and got no response. After twenty minutes of trying I finally got a human voice. She was nice and shipped the parts. They arrived today and guess what? The same wrong parts again. I can't get a response so I guess I will have to also go and purchase the stuff to put it together. At least I have a list from the owner's manual. Overall experience was a big fat bust 
 If you are interested in reading a bunch of ignorant, bigoted stereo types, by all means buy this book. Robert Tallant was not a writer to bother with facts when spewing his hatred and racism. His depictions of New Orleans Voodoo and it's practitioners are dead wrong. If you want to read about New Orleans Voodoo, try Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau by Martha Ward. 
 I gave this book a 100 page chance and still could not get hooked.  After reading all the reviews, I thought it would be an outstanding read, but for me, it was plain old B O R I N G.  Since it didn't pick up by page 100, I figure there are plenty of other books out there worth my time.  Sorry.  I vote two thumbs down on this one 
 If you are expecting a sound from Thom Yorke as good as the band he fronts, you will be disappointed.  I do not believe this album is close to the quality of any Radiohead album.  T.Yorke is too experimental with his solo debut.  I am not impressed. "The Erasure" has glimpses of the brilliance of 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac' but doesn't come close to matching either of Radiohead's most recent releases. 
 Reality Bites seemed fresh when it was first released, giving voice to a generation - with the unfortunately derogative soubriquet of "X" - that was overeducated, underemployed, plagued by the flashy, trashy commercialism of MTV, and stunningly superficial in its wholehearted embrace of pop culture and rejection of serious moral or philosophical discourse it might have stumbled across in college.    It was a good start because transitioning from the idyllic and unreal world of college to the crass, cruel arena of materialism can be tough, providing limitless opportunities for challenge and personal growth - the very stuff of real movies.  Instead we have a swan dive into a Pizza Hut commercial held together by a plot so shop-worn it would have been considered exhausted in 1930.  Winona Ryder is winning as Lelaina, but one can only imagine the SATs of football players at a college where she is valedictorian.  Her "documentary" is appallingly narcissistic, reflecting the characteristic Gen X notion that - "if it's about me, it's art, and it's important."  Ethan Hawke does an excellent job as Troy, the very archetype of self-satisfied, supercilious entitlement.  We are expected to root for him, but it's hard to refrain from hoping he gets hit by a bus.  Stiller, who directed - a talented fellow almost impossible to look at - plays Michael, the "anti-Troy."  Smooth, successful, and very much plugged into the contemporary franchising of Gen X culture - if culture is the right word - he's an executive at an MTV-ish corporation.  That he improves Lelaina's preposterous "documentary," rather than destroying its alleged artistic integrity, is the film's dirty little secret.  Viewers surprised by who wins Lelaina's hand will also be stunned to learn that professional wrestling is fixed and Liberace was gay.  Indeed, when you strip away the thin veneer of pop culture references this is really a very traditional movie.  Janeane Garofalo is outstanding as always, and John Mahoney shines as the TV morning chat show host who looks sweet and avuncular on camera but is in fact, a bastard.  His performance says more about the likelihood of finding anything even remotely resembling reality in film - or on TV - than the rest of this film put together.  In fact, reality is great, this picture would have benefited from some 
 I started the Full series a few years back when I needed an Evanovich fix between Plum books. I loved the first 3, after that I can't say they have lived up to my expectations.  This latest is the worse of all, it reminds of the 180 page romance novels of the early 70's, you know the ones you'd 6 of every month in the mail? Juvenile and unrealistic, sorry Janet but this one is a stinker for those of us used to the great Stephanie Plum novels and even the Barnaby series. Lorelei King does her best, but even a great reader can't help this book 
 I just received and tested this item.  The idea and the design looked very attractive, especially the USB port. But ... Your guess is right!  This modulator produces a lot of static noise and music and voice comes dull (I tried all 14 frequencies). Do not buy this item!  I give my respect to the seller zibeta.com - they delivered it quickly - but I am going to return this item 
 Besides being a poorly edited book with numerous grammatical errors, this book shines as a true look at the hatred and bigotry that the right wing spew towards anyone not carrying NRA badges.  After reading about half the book and checking the "facts" presented I can say that this book is pure fiction.  The authors are the worst form of yellow journalists I have ever read.  If you are right-wing and opposed to fact and live in your own world this book is for you.  If you are an educated living being then this book is best used as fireplace starter fuel 
 Nicholsan's performance is without a doubt superior, but the material is second-rate.  Why anyone would want to make a movie like this, much less act in it, is beyond me.  It depicts a bunch of self-obsessed and depressed people(unless they're two-dimensionally portrayed egotistical and superficial snobs to whom the depressed losers feel superior) doing stupid things and being nasty to one another.  You just feel sad and frustrated after watching it, because it doesn't reflect life as it really is, or at the very least, it doesn't give a full view of life, just the small, mean, petty, grimy, sordid vision of one unhappy screenwriter who thinks they're being deep and insightful 
 Both musically and creatively Luca Turilli is, in this disc, under himself. The trilogy project started well, «Prophet of the Last Eclipse» meaned an incredible quality jump, and logically the waited «punch line» created great expectation. But then, «The Infinite Wonders of Creation» happens. And what a disappoint. The sound here is totally different in a bad way, likewise the style. What we love in the previous albums --brilliant passages, emotive choral segments, interesting themes and stories, the fast and furious drums, among many other things-- is now disappeared. Definitly the trilogy is not well closed; Turilli is in debt with his exquisite work. «The Infinite Wonders of Creation» is not one of them 
 They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok, the shoe isn't the best made thing but is adequate; it's just the size thing that bothered me 
 This book is the only one that I can find in the bookshelf discuss Verilog-A language. I expect it can provide some examples to model a real world analog circuit using Verilog-A language, but I am disappointed  because this book provides only simple description about resistors,  capacitors, etc. You can't even find how to model an opamp in this book 
 i loved marques houston in immature/imx.  his first solo cd was good.  he's a decent actor as well.  this cd, however, does not match up AT ALL with other stuff he's done.  all because of u and naked were good songs (and naked was a good video ;) )  i think there was one other good song - but, i sold this cd to a used cd store about 2 weeks after i got it.  i couldnt even listen to most of the songs all the way through.  boring.  vulgar language.  mh is just trying too hard by using the n-word a lot and talking dirty.  sex music can be classy - but not on his cd.  i was soooooooooooooooo disappointed with this piece of crap cd.  do NOT buy it!!!!  
 	If you like Dee Henderson's book Danger in the Shadows, you will like the book The Negotiator. In the book Dave from Danger in the Shadows meets the O'Malley, a group of orphans or abandoned kids who adopted themselves into a family of seven, and begins a friendship with them. The first O'Malley that he meets is Kate; she is a negotiator who walks into any situation to make sure all of the hostages get out alive. She just so happens that she gets called out to negotiate at the same bank that Dave is getting held at. Between the two of them all of the hostages get out a live and they hit off a good friendship.  	Then Kate starts to become a target, first to a stalker that just got out of jail and then to a bomber that blew up a plane with 214 people on it just after he told her he not to forget the past. Dave, an FBI agent, is the assigned to be Kate's watcher. When Kate's family gets to the wreck, they are as mad as she is and tell her that she is staying with Dave because his house was used as a Safe House for his sister when she was staying away from her kidnapper. Then on top of all of this, the suspect is her brother that was born one year after she was taken away from her parents and the youngest of the O'Malley's has cancer. This is a book of a group of adults who have been hardened by their past trying to find god's mercy and power in a time of despair. 	I liked almost everything part of this book because it was a mix of books that I like. The only part that I didn't like about it was that is some places it was dragged on a bit too long.  	I would recremend this book to any body who likes novels of suspense and people over coming odds and ending up at the top.     
 As stated by numerous other readers, the characters in this book bear no resemblance whatsoever to those that Jane Austen created in her own novel. Even the characters that appeared in the original Pride and Prejudice seem so completely and utterly changed, the only thing they seem to share at all is a name.   From a semi-historical standpoint, Aston does trot out a few colloquialisms and descriptions that seem realistic, however the behavior and actions of the characters themselves are completely anachronistic. It was laughingly sex-fueled and over-done, more of a Harlequin corset-ripper than any homage to Austen's fabulous creation. 
 Not insightful, not even humorous. I am willing to admit that maybe I just don't get his writing style, whatever that might be. I hope Mr. Rakoff gets into a new line of wor 
 Misled by its title, I was expecting that this book was about making rustic furniture. However only the last third of the book is about this. Two thirds of the books (100 p.) consists in  a gallery of pictures (with some comments), mostly chairs. Their style is not modern, but not traditional either. I find most to be weird or snob. Actually many look postmodern to me (they may not all be from the author, but from his friends -many being also from New York City like him). These may be a source of inspiration for some, but definitely not what I am looking for.  And that last third of the book, about making things is also quite a deception in itself. It is a collection of shallow articles by other authors, who show projects they make,   with a very vague and general talk about the technique they use. One uses tenons and mortises (anyone knowing a bit about conventional woodworking will not learn anything here), and worse, others use nails and even bolts (the last one). I really learned nothing from this. In addition, this is all about dry wood.   I recommend instead Les Smith's Build your own Log Furniture (only a little bit of technique, for dry softwood, but at least something...), and much more a book where you really can learn many things: Drew Langsner's Green Woodworking 
 Mr. Goldberg obviously worked and worked at this book. It is chock full of information, some of it now dated. But mainly, one can see the seams, the labor in the writing, which makes for labored reading. Not recommended 
 I took Just Enough Chinese with me to China in October 2001 but never used it because I found its phonetics to be faulty.  For example, the first phrase to learn is Xiexie, which means thank you.  This book would have you say "Sie-sie," by which I guess it means "See-see."  However, "ie" in pinyin spelling is said like the "e" in "yes."  Furthermore, the pinyin "x" is much closer to our "sh" than it is to "s," so nothing about the pronunciation offered is sufficiently accurate.  Our tour guide in China said that "see-see" is the Chinese equivalent of what we euphemistically call "tinkle" (urination by a small child).  Is that what you want to say instead of thank you 
 though there are some moments this film is pretty predictable in spots. I just happen to catch it on the other night.there were some laughs here&there 
 Since the end of the Cold War, writers and political commentators have suggested that we have entered a new war - a war brought on by the "clash of civilizations". The theory, as told by writers such as Samuel Huntington and Bernard Lewis, amongst others, suggests that "the west" is at war with Islam and that this global divide will replace the earlier Cold War acrimony. Not for any particular reason or circumstance is this war being waged against us, they suggest, but merely because of its violent nature and hatred of western civilization. It is the very essence of Islam, a religion that does not share core values with ours which is the problem, and the only way to contain its violence is to be merciless in our efforts to do so.     Aside from this rhetoric being advocated as "fact" by news organizations such as FOX cable news, CNN, and most newspapers, this thesis has been regularly used by the powerful to justify wars. The U.S. used it to justify the war with Iraq and Afghanistan; Serbs and Croatians used it to justify ethnic cleansing of Bosnian and Kosovar Muslims; and it is used by Israel to justify their "war" with Palestinians.    The Clash of Civilization rhetoric suggests that the world will always be at war. As opposed to the Cold War with the Soviet Union (a country only in existence for less than a century), Islam is an old religion spread  throughout the world. The framework of the Cold war between the Communist "east" and the capitalist "west" did prove useful in making this theory. The new war is between the rational, democratic, secular, and tolerant "west" and the irrational, fundamentalist, and violent "east". Orwell could have predicted this well: the new enemy created on the morning after the old enemies fell. It almost seems that for the "west"  to feel at home with itself, it needs to be at constant war with some "other". Perhaps it provides some guidance to what we are and what we are not - we are simply not the "other". Perhaps Chomsky and others who have suggested that a major reason that states fight wars is for domestic reasons and for the disciplining of a nation's own population are right.     Not according to the "clash theorists" like Bernard Lewis, who claim that the clash will continue as long as Islam exists. He believes that the radical Islamic militants are not deviants from Islam, but actually have a more correct view of it. They will therefore likely become more influential over the years. But if such a clash really existed, why then do western nations continue to support both financially and militarily such Islamic groups and nations? As Eqbal Amad noted, the U.S. has long supported this very enemy, be it with Iraq (during and after the Iraq-Iran wars), the Saudi Monarchy, or the Afghani Mujahadeen.     Perhaps this theory falls within the entire framework of colonialism. Western colonial nations conquered the world and forced its non-western inhabitants to submit to their authority. It was believed and advocated that colonialism would help these "backward" people in the long run to become just like the colonists. Beyond the arrogance of the idea, colonialism developed sophisticated systems of slavery and servitude that sought to extract valuable natural resources from these areas for the sole benefit of their the colonizers own nations.     Interestingly anti-western Islamic militants use the same kind of "absolute conflict" to frame their war with the West. They say the conflict is between the hedonistic, degenerate, repressive, soulless West and the just, truthful, and moral center of Islam. Speaking to this subject, writers Qureshi and Sells note:     "Those who proclaim such a clash of civilizations, speaking for the West or for Islam, exhibit the characteristics of fundamentalism: the assumption of a static essence, knowable immediately, of each civilization, the ability to ignore history and tradition, and the desire to lead the ideological battle on behalf of one of the clashing civilizations". 
 The author states that her program is easy and inexpensive and that the ingredients can be found in any drug store or natural foods market.  First of all, the ingredients (good luck finding them) are expensive. I've gone to several drug stores and natural food markets and have not been able to find all the ingredients.  Secondly, the ingredients are expensive, and contrary to what others have mentioned in their reviews, they don't last that long. Sounded like most reviewers hadn't started the program quite yet and were swayed by the author's claims.  Lastly, this book, as well as the follow up, "Grow Hair Fast," are extremely poorly written. As a matter of fact, the 2 books are nearly identical to one another. I guess if the guidelines listed were truly easy and inexpensive, then everybody would be doing it, and the big drug companies wouldn't have any products on the market for hair loss. 
 Maybe this book is good if you don't know any better, but I couldn't help but notice a Zionist slant when it came to discussing either the greatness or victimhood of the Jewish people, as compared to only about 6 instances of mere mention of the Arab people but only as slave traders.  So, there you go, the vilification of Arabs yet again by an unsuspecting Zionist.  Only 6 lines dedicated to a people who have been greatly instrumental in much of civilization as we know it today, and all this person can say is they were instrumental in the slave trade?  And lest we forget, Palestinian Arabs have been and still are victims of the criminal Zionists going on over 100 years now!  Where's that mention?  I thought this book was about race, why not mention the racism that exists today that is wiping out a large group of indigenous people today, the Palestinians!  Looking at the mega ratings this book has gotten, I suppose I'm one of the few people who would notice such things because this sort of Zionist superiority and Arab bashing is so rampant in this country it's often overlooked and is why it's so easy for us to bomb Arab countries without too much of an outcry.  But Arabs have contributed greatly to our world especially in the fields of medicine, physics, chemistry, mathematics, and astronomy, and I happen to be a big fan of their contribution to arts (especially music) and literature (too many to mention).  So it seems I will have to continue my search to find a book that isn't so self serving and narrow in its agenda disguised as defining race and culture. 
 This book exposes nothing.  There are way-better books out there, better written and better researched.  I bought it after watching her much needed bashing of these retarded Neo-Cons on Bill Maher's show.  Here's the lowdown:  She grabs one subject and repeats it dozens of different ways, adding new twists, puns and jokes.  The book has no cohesive structure.  Like an ADD-sufferer on coffee. Worst of all, she was part of that system.  She gets divorced, and boom.  Her politics take a 180 degree turn.  How's that supposed to work?  If the payoffs from these interest groups are providing for your cushy life, it's good.  But if you divorce your Neo-Con husband, then, all of a sudden it's bad.  Honestly, I see a lack of integrity here.  So, if tomorrow she marries a communist, will she be singing Lenin's praises?  Or how about a devil-worshiper?  Will she go satanic? Then, I watched her devolve on Maher's show, constantly doing nothing but vent her anger at her ex-husband in a thin veil of politics.  She ran for Cali governor and her points were high.  Then, she started opening her mouth, and her points plumetted.  For good reason.  Because she ran a negative campaign against the Governator. (Which is exactly the same thing she acuses Neo-Cons of doing in this worthless book). But, of course, knee-jerk liberals love her, because they see her as a repented sinner who sees the error of her ways.  LET ME SUM UP THE BOOK FOR YOU:  A party holds on to power too long, it becomes corrupt.  Campaign reform is needed.  End of story 
 If Pinter contented himself with Becket- Ionesco- like dialogues of the deaf, poetic renderings of fragmented human inadequacy then it would be possible to appreciate a certain poetic quality in him. But he like a good Stalinist has to dictate for us the nature of our political reality, and in doing so turns out to be a truly one- sided fanatic, choosing what to my mind, are the bad- guys in every conflict in the world. His hatred of America is in my mind sickening and unfair. He makes the best into the worst, and celebrates radical terrorists and other chic dirt.  Boo.    
 I have been using a Marineland Bio-Wheel 280 for over a year now and each month it is a horrible chore to clean the thing. In addition it's noisy. Sure it filters okay, but I got so tired of having to clean the thing I decided, just for convenience, try a much less expensive and LESS powerful filter. I got a Whisper 20-40. I was shocked that the Whisper 20-40 works a LOT better than this 280 and churns out a lot more power with truly whisper quality noise. Easy to maintain too. I put my Marineland Bio-Wheel 280 in the shack and will probably throw it away.   THE MARINELAND BIO-WHEEL 280 IS A PAIN TO START--TRY GETTING IT RUN WITHOUT THAT WHIRR WHIRR WHIRR LIKE IT'S IN PAIN TO A STEADY FLOW TAKES ABOUT 5 TO 7 MINUTES WITH CONSTANT THROWING WATER IN THE CONTAINER. The Whisper 20-40 only took 10 seconds with the container even just half full of water. So what's the deal with this 280? As far as I'm concerned it's a waste of money. THE BIOWHEEL IS ALSO TERRIBLE--sure bacteria grows on it, but take it out of the water for a few minutes say goodbye to your colony. 
 I have the same review as the rest.  Thankfully, we checked it out after we bought it and were able to return it for another model before Christmas.  The remote control Lightning McQueen with the regular controls (one lever for forward and back, another lever for right and left) was an excellent alternative.  I would recommend it for any child over about 3 1/2.  
 It is not good as  a mainstream movie , it does not have a good plot , some scenes are not relevant . Even as a soft-porn movie, it does not do a good job. Try watching "I like to play games" , its a much better soft-porn movie.  
 Somehow this book ended up being a required text in my full-time MBA program.  We complained so much that this was a 1st year 'college level' book and not appropriate at our level that my school discontinued it the following year.  Now I can't resell my 'unused' version on campus.  What a waste 
 This looks so hilarious!  How did you lose Jessica Simpson you dolt?!  What a loser, now he'll be relegated to the back of page six and then gone forever, way to use 'em and lose 'em Simpson.  
 An amazing transformation came over me while reading this book. No, I did not turn into a lizard or a bird. Never before have I experienced such an enormous swing in my state of mind while reading a book. No classic has moved me so much. No works of Hume, nor Kant, nor even Harry Potter's chambermaid have driven in me such a force of wild-eyed realization as compared with this amazing collection of words. I will do my best to describe the story, without boxing your ears or tugging my braid.  The story starts like all of Jordan's stories do, which is to say that an avalanche of words were used to describe such mundane things as grass and horse eye lashes. Nevertheless, Jordan's indispensable and uncanny knack for stringing words together kept me in the game. I had read the first seven books in the series and knew what I was up against. This was nothing. A hundred, two hundred, or even fifty thousand words to describe yet another immature dialog between a pair of immature people wedged in an altogether immature scenario would never get me down.  But as time wore on, it started to wear on me. Like water over a rock, my meddle started to wan, slowly washing away with the sands of the wheel of time. I began zoning out, unable to focus on the words on the page before me, finding myself having read an entire paragraph with no recollection of having done so. I wondered, am I really taking an SAT test? All my previous training seemed to have left me. My eyes were failing me, my brain quitting. I was aghast. This series of books that had heretofore been as straight in it's narrative as a pentangle was bogging down more than I thought even possible. I was losing interest. The flame was going out.  But I dug deep. I concentrated on the void, the endless void, the taint of Boredom making the void sickly sweet and palpable in my veins. I could taste it, it's sickening blackened bleary broken bleakness trying to take over my mind, my body, my soul. I controlled it. And with that control, Jordan's world of Boredom coursed through my veins like a pat of hot butter on a toasted English muffin on a hot summer day in Florida when the air conditioner is broken.  Shortly I had discovered the long lost Talent of Skimming. What had previously taken hours to read now took minutes! Pages down in seconds, chapters in no time at all. Boredom? Shredded to bits. Single words picked here and there, dialog grasped in an instant when the words "boxed" or "grasped" sprung from the page. I was alive, I was being tainted by Boredom! The lost Talent of Skimming, an astoundingly rare yet miraculously rediscovered Talent much like others I came across while reading this book, made me feel more alive than ever. Not to be outdone, Skimming was joined by Sleeping, Ignoring, Laughing, Putting Down, and Reading Something Else. All amazing powers in their own right, but nothing to hold a candle to Skimming.  In no time, Jordan's 8th book came to a close, and the narrative was no closer to being resolved than if all the characters had jumped into a blender and pressed the puree button, using the One Power of course. I mean, how else would they press the puree button if they were *in* the blender? I dare say that it would be improbable.  In any event, this book was so bad that the time invested in all 8 can't keep me coming back for a 9th. Fool me 8 times, shame on you. Fool me 9, shame on me 
 This is about the worst biography I've ever read. The author doesn't really know more about Soros than all of us who have read Soros's own books. All the materials used by the book seem to be second-handed.  What's more, when you read a book on Soros, it ought to be his investment stories that are most intriguing. This book, unfortunately, devotes a tiny coverage on Soros's investment life. Most of the book is on some mumble jumble stuff that nobody cares.  Lastly, the book isn't perticularly well written. Extremely boring.  
 When Danny Devito's plays Larry Garfield he is like Taxi's Louie De Palma of Wall Street 
 The Wisdom of Menopause provides an accurate description of what happens to a woman's body during and after ovarian failure (menopause). This book describes in detail the negative effects of menopause (ovarian failure) while still describing it as a natural and normal process to embrace. I don't believe we should be so willing to allow our ovaries to fail, instead we should look for ways to help them work better and for longer. 
 This is the first Grafton book I've read, but I'm pretty sure it will be my last.  Simply put, this is the worst book I've read in the past year.  The plot is ridiculous: it centers around the murder of woman who is prostitute/porn star/water treatment plant worker.  The characters only exist as canned responses to the investigator's questions.  Critical clue are revealed in predictable fashion to achieve an utterly anti-climactic ending devoid of any epiphanies or suspense.  
 My boyfriend pitched this as a hilarious must-see and now I cite that as an example of why I could not stand him and why we broke up.  My main problem was with the lightning-quick but utterly insipid dialogue. The headline sums up how I felt about that 
 While this is an excellent and well written story, the Blackstone Audio version is horribly read. It is painful to listen to. The reader is very "nasal" and the attempts at accents and characterizations are just simply horrific. Find another version, or read the book if you can. I can't, and had to endure this version of the audiobook. I listen to a LOT of audiobooks and this experience was a nightmare 
 The series started off so well, it's sad to see it end so badly. This book is just a collection of random events, there really isn't a plot. None of the questions raised throughout the series are answered.  The first book was great, I wish I had stopped there. 
 Originally written as a college paper, this book takes the author's personal beliefs and poorly attempts to make them the entire history of a loosely defined set of musical and cultural styles that began probably long before the author was old enough to speak. He's a hippie punk with crusty leanings, which means love, peace, anarchy and not bathing too often, and the whole history of punk is redefined to the point of pretending most everything else doesn't exist. It's hysterical reading his mental gymnastics when describing Anarchy as both violent and peaceful. Anyone who gives this a good review has to be blinded by their own political ideology since this book is soooooooo poorly done. It's not a history at all. It's an editorial steeped in too much wishful thinking 
 As a Bob Dylan aficiondo, I decided to add this one to the home library...Big Mistake. The quality of the photos are substandard and appear to be taken by an amature photographer. Also, I agree with the previous review regarding the irrelevant text that drifts aimlessly throughtout the entire book, complete waste of time. Marsh & Gilbert's attempt to unload mediocre material is very clear to any true enthusiast. Save yourself the money and disappointment.   
 This epic work is currently being referenced repeatedly as a cautionary tale of what the U.S. should be careful of in Iraq.  Superlatives like "history at its best", "an all-time classic" and "superbly accurate" are being tossed around carelessly to describe Alistair Horne's history.  In fact, it remains a remarkably racist work loved by State Department officials and neocons alike - similar, but not quite on par with, the racial hatred on display in that other State Department favourite, The Arab Mind, by Raphael Patai.  In this work, Alistair Horne describes in gory detail atrocities committed by the FLN, or Algerian nationalist rebels, while skimming over far worse atrocities committed by the nice white-guy French.    Atrocities are not to be ranked, measured, and compared, but Horne's bias becomes transparent when he describes in detail and over several pages the killing of 100 French - a tragic and ugly incident, no doubt - but then blithely mentions in passing, without flesh-and-blood detail, that the French killed 6,000 Algerians in response.  Six thousand!  Most of these were summary executions of unarmed prisoners, a common French tactic, and many thousands of the civilians murdered were toddlers and elderly women.  This is but a glimpse into the sick mind of Alistair Horne, who manages somehow to see the French as victims.  He deplores the damage to the French psyche caused by their torture of thousands of Algerian civilians, without once considering the damage the torture had on Algerians, the actual people being tortured.    Horne makes cursory mentions of barbaric acts committed by the French but never draws the conclusion that French society itself may have been perverse, twisted, or morally sick.  Yet, he has no hesitation in expressing that Algerians' behaviour proves that they are somehow subhuman, or less human, than Europeans.  In short, this is a good book to read to understand how once upon a time the French, like the Americans today, felt themselves infallible, civilised, and racially superior to Arab and other "primitive" peoples.  It is an illusion that must be fought.  Another reviewer on this site mentions that Horne's book covers "Islamic terrorism", but no such phrase is to be found in his book.  Contrary to what most Americans believe today, so-called "Islamic terror" is not an eternal and everlasting feature of the modern world; in 1977, when Horne wrote this work, there had yet been no Iranian revolution, no Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (and hence no al-Qaida), no Israeli occupation of south Lebanon (and hence no Hizbullah), and no Israeli-supported creation of Hamas as a counterweight to the secular PLO.  Therefore, no such concept of "Islamic terrorism" existed in Horne's mind or in any other person's mind in 1977.  It is a failing of the human mind to write current events into history; American journalists employ it as their favourite agitprop tactic.    
 I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it. Instead, rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story, made you want to read the next page, and perhaps, in the end, changed your view of the world 
 I was disappointed in this book, had I not been on a coast-coast flight I would not have finished it.  The author could not keep track of whether his characters had their footwear on or off, among other problems.  The two main characters could not between them fight their way out of a wet paper bag if decision making were part of the process.  Watching them do stuipid things repeatedly for the sake of the plot became very trying.  It's too bad, the universe is interesting.  
 This is my opinion only. This diet is just to far out there.  For example it wants you to eat Free range eggs but not really Chicken eggs?  Come on.  The average person doesn't have access to eggs that are not from a chicken.   The General idea of the diet is a good one they just go overboard.  Basically it is a low carb diet made more difficult.  You would almost have to be a fanatic to have any luck with this diet.    
 ...I thought it was going to be another film like "the Incredible Journey"  or even like "air bud".  My son loves both these pet films and I thought this one would be cute like those.  But, I actually found it to be alittle long and 'draggy'.  I didn't really feel like it ever enticed even my attention. I just couldn't develop the love for the animals and characters in this one, like i did in "the Incredible Journey" and "Air Bud".   Anyway,  For [the money], I really can't complain. Maybe we'll give the movie another try in 6 months. I'll keep it in the video cabinet for now 
 "A NEW Approach to Understanding the End Time Mysteries in the Book of Revelation"?  That sub-title right there told me this book is false.  Dr. Harry Ironside, one of America's greatest theologians of the past made this statement that certainly applies to Jack Hayford's book:  "Be careful of any teaching that is new; it might not be true."      There were other problems with the book as well.  Jack Hayford downplays how bad the tribulation will be and makes the reader believe it's simply a bad time of persecution, rather than great calamity.  The tribulation is a time to punish the ungodly and a time for God to deal with Israel again.  The church will NOT be here.  Stephen King couldn't put together what's really going to happen during the earth's darkest hour!  Where in the world does Hayford come up with the idea that the white horse in Revelation 6 is Jesus?  Jesus has already been crowned in Revelation 4 by the saints in heaven and doesn't have to work for the crowns as Hayford thinks.  Didn't Hayford bother to look at the Greek words for "crown" in Revelation 6 and Revelation 19?  They're two different words!  "Crown" in chapter 6 is the word "stephanos" while chapter 19 is the word "diadema". Obviously, they're two different words!  He also makes the rapture no big deal.  Believe me, it will be a big deal!      Hayford symbolizes the book of Revelation too much, a great danger to anyone studying Revelation.  In short, the pre-wrath view of the rapture has seized America like a prairie fire.  That's sad because it's a false theory that dates back to about 1977 or somewhere in the '70s.  That's a far cry from the Pre-trib rapture that dates to the time of Christ and the Apostle Paul.  Other writers have written commentaries on Revelation and they're pre-trib.  Amazing how they've been preserved all these years!  What makes this generation anymore special than past generations?  Past generations spent much more time in the Bible. Today's generation is dumb compared to scholars up to 100 years ago.  As my review title says, Hayford should stick with other topics in the Bible, ones he's better at.  His view of Revelation is in serious error and is a far cry from "the blessed hope" in Titus 2:13 
 This is when of those albums where about halfway through each song you say "when is this gonna get going?" and none of them ever do.  It's like slow-motion bland-pop 
 I was dissapointed in the accuracy of information in "The Enycyclopedia of TV Game Shows".  While the selection of photos from Schwartz's and Wostbrock personal collection is nice; the inaccurate information is something else.  "Sale of the Century" is one page with such misinformation; many other entries have inaccurate information as well.  Well the effort is nice; I'm afraid the authors need to leave with some nice parting gifts 
 If you are looking for a textbook you can use to learn statistical methods, this is not the one. The book is most useful for scientists experienced in applying the methods of statistics, who want to sharpen their mathematical apparatus to put their research on a firm foundation. The level of mathematical knowledge required to read the book is not very high but quite demanding as in many cases lots of intermediary calculations are left to the reader, so to properly read the book you have to have a pen and paper to follow the derivation of formulae 
 If Paul and Ringo decided to record an album together and called themselves "The Beatles," would everyone think that was cool? Of course not. Big Star was a quartet, ultimately reduced to two by the time this uneven and often gloomy collection of songs was recorded. Chris Bell defined the sound of, and essentially produced, the excellent debut album "#1 Record." If you want to know how much the Big Star sound had already been crystallized before "LX" Chilton got involved, listen to the three eventual Big Star tracks on the album by Bell's previous band "Rock City," now commercially available on CD. Fast forwarding back to Big Star, Bell was involved in the first demo session for "Radio City" and wrote a good chunk of "Back Of A Car" before departing the band. Yes, Chilton deserves credit for carrying on and writing great songs like "September Gurls," for the second album, but by the time his sometimes-cowriter Andy Hummel had also departed, the band had essentially ended. Chilton and drummer Jody Stephens admitted as much when they called themselves "Sister Lovers" on the session sheets for the album later mislabled as "Big Star's Third." Stephens, as noted by other reviewers, actually writes and sings one of the better songs on the album, "For You." Alex has his moments here and there, but seems to have lost his spark for writing and recording what we would now refer to as "power pop." And despite his eventual cult status, has never really regained it in any sustained way. Personally, I prefer Bell's "I Am The Cosmos," but if you're going to pick up "Third," get the Bell CD as well, and decide for yourself who still had the chops 
 It is not so much that I did not think the plot plausable, but the characterizations are untrue to the original book.  I feel not enough time and care was taken to move the plot within the parameters of the characters as set by JA.  Miss Darcy, although entertaining, becomes a pale shade of Elizabeth Bennett.  Lady Catherine becomes flaccidly comic (has she become a vicar or even transposed with Mr Collins?)  It pains me also to see the most interesting and engaging characters of Elizabeth and Darcy pushed so far into the background.  I also take issue with the use of Lizzy and Fitzwilliam as the familiar names the couple uses when refering to each other.  I am almost certain that Elizabeth would always be Elizabeth in Darcy's eyes and that none of the characters in P&P would have used anything but Darcy's surname.  All of this censure aside, it was a good attempt.  I thought the phrasing and meter of the work to pay homage to Austen.  I also admire the care taken in research of the subject matter and time period.  I would recommend this book as what it is aptly titled ":An Entertainment" 
 A more apt question would be; what do the Okinawans eat or what do the Hunza eat? Those are two healthy, long-lived civilizations. The Swiss rate right up there as well so why not ask what they eat? 
 The author basically believes that Satan rules the world with the help of evil angels and demons.  He bases this a bit on scripture, but just as much on the fact that it's the best answer he can think of for why, if there is a good God, bad things happen to good people, or good people do bad things. He's fixated on the question of blame (can't blame God because God is good, can't blame the good Christian because that would be unChristian, ergo we should blame Satan). If you're inclined to blame tragedy and sin on Satan and his minions, this is the book for you.  Otherwise, you probably won't make it through the first 50 pages.   That said, the author is a good writer and has a lot of powerful anecdotes to illustrate his point.  And his advice is, essentially, to be aware of your own circumstances, desires, and surroundings, and think about the consequences of your choices in light of your faith, which is good (if obvious) advice for anyone.  
 Please have a look before you buy! Be sure to check  out the vacuous tables that inform us, for example,  that the "Suspend" operation"Suspends a task" and  so on for seven other task-related operations. This  is a quibble, but I think the lack of content in the  tables reflects a grave shortcoming of the book as  a whole: there's just not much there. In my opinion  part of the problem is lack of specificity. I wish  that the authors had focused on a single real operating  system (e.g. VxWorks) with actual code examples rather attempting the very difficult task of covering the  entire real-time operating system landscape 
 As a believer in God, I was hoping for a new balanced discussion of  creation, life and its origins. The first part of the book is a rehash of the many already established arguments for and against a Creator. Nothing new there. The middle section makes a better argument for "macroevolution" than I had previously understood However, this in no way adequately explains away the nagging counter-argument to macroevolution of "irreducible complexity" as put forth by Dr. Beh. The third part is "witnessing" for Christ, pure and simple and does not belong in a book that is purportedly a scientific expounding of the relevant arguments. The appendix is a filler or the book would have been too short. Finally, the argument for "theistic evolution" is weak and unsupported and violates all the premesis the author had used to argue against "intelligent design" 
 After reading Anthony's "Scar Tissue" it's really tough for any other book on rock music to hold up. I thought I'd read "Velvet Groove" to get an outsider's perspective. Very early on in the book I started noticing typos, at least one in every chapter. After awhile it's kind of insulting to the reader. Even the name of the BAND was misspelled once as the Red Hit Chili Peppers (and no it wasn't an intentional thing implying that they had lot's of "hits"). If the book was compelling I could overlook the typos and bad grammar, but this one is really a yawn-fest that is only interesting when interview quotes from Rolling Stone magazine are provided.   In the author's bio it states that "Roach has written over 80 titles and many biographies of rock bands" (I am paraphrasing) It is my opinion that this writer should focus more on quality than quantity and for God's sake hire a proof reader 
 This is by far one of the worse things I've ever heard. Right up there with Chingy or Changy or whatever it is. They should be ashamed. It's a miracle that can say "Laffy Taffy" and still show their faces in public. For shame for shame. For the record, D4L, to para-quote your own lyrics, No "I can't do it it like you" nor would I want to. I would never suck so bad. 1 Star here it comes 
 It gets two stars for the unintentional comedy. Other than that, it's one of the worst of the ultra-cheesy, predictable, low-budget horror movies from the early nineties. The FX are funny at first, but then they just go on and on and on and the sucking takes over from the comedy. The acting is uniformly terrible, and one has to image that the typically enjoyable Barrymore is just glad to have this ridiculous part of her career well behind her 
 I would have given it one star but it deserves two for the last chapter which was quite good. Overall the book in my mind cannot even be compared to Notes From Underground which is a true existential work of art. My bias I believe comes from prefering an existential character to be more intelligent than the average person, not just simply more apathetic such as The Strangers main character. I found the book to be very boring. This is just my opinion, and many people find the book great and I have no quarrel with that 
 I bought it on Aug 24th and it is already Sept 23 but I haven't received it.  I already requested for refund.  What a worst service you guys offer!! I won't buy it via your service again 
 This movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and Amazon customers that I was expecting great things. While I agree the acting (especially the girls playing Christy and Ariel) is excellent the story is just too implausible and I got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from Canada to the US (yes they are Irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the US from Canada). Anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the US with their two kids illegally, without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country?  I know the dad is an actor but couldn't he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to Manhattan? The mom is a teacher but can't find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally. Yet there is money for private school, fixing up the dump of an apartment, an expensive camcorder, betting the rent money on an ET doll etc.  I can't imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the "drug house" with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please.  Mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child - a son - that has recently died.  I kept expecting someone to call Social Services.   And the medical situations with both Frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched. The symbolism between Mateo, the new baby and Frankie is very heavy handed. Though the film is told through the oldest daughter's eyes  because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children.  And there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all.   Maybe if I had taken it more as a fable I would have "gotten" this movie more but I was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed. 
 Wasn't a fan of this book. I found that the caloric intake and the levels of fat were much too high for someone who is a casual athlete. If I'm Lance Armstrong and am training for hours every day, this diet makes sense. But as it is, I am a recreational triathlete who tries to keep her diet near 1500 calories to maintain my weight. More, I gain. Less, I bonk on workouts.   Secondly, I have to disagree with the people who found the recipes as being "too difficult". If anything, I was turned off by the lack of interesting recipes and the simplistic nature of the detail. Maybe some people need a lot of help in the kitchen. However, I don't like cookbooks that could be filled with more recipes instead filled with asinine directions such as "Take a noodle out of the water. Set it on a plate. Let it cool. Taste it. This is how you can tell if the pasta is done." You really can't dumb down the tough task of boiling water, throwing in pasta, and draining it, but Carmichael managed to. I really disliked this to the point where I just sort of glanced over recipes and prepared the ingredients listed in my own way 
 This Guide refers to the meter focus button, which would permit you to change meter focus modes with a mere twirl of the command wheel. Problem: the D-70 has this button, but the D-50 does not.  One wonders how many other inaccuracies this book contains 
 I had high hopes for this book based on the subject matter. The book was nothing like I expected. It reads like a 10 year old's term paper. If that is the target audience then the book is a success. However if you graduated from grade school then you will probably be disappointe 
 This truly was the most disappointing Ed McBain book I have read!  By the time I had read 150 pages I decided I'd had enough...the plot is too easy to figure out, no suspense, the cops are a farce and put a bad name on Florida law enforcemente, etc., etc.  I sure hope McBain goes back to the 87th Precinct and "finds himself" once again 
 Where's the subtitle of this very effective book?  Did the modern editors simply take it away?  Darwin titled his book: "The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection" and subtitled it: "The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life."  When Hitler came to power in 1933, he had one overarching idea in mind: his radical Nazi racial philosophy built on the Darwinian principle of natural selection.  Hilter thought the Aryans were the fittest and he wanted to help speed up the "inevitability" of natural selection.  He first started off with the sterilization of nine categories of "the unfit" which were feebleminded, schizophrenia, manic depression, Huntington's chorea, epilepsy, hereditary body deformities, deafness, hereditary blindness and alcoholism.  He then worked his way up to attempting the complete extermination of entire categories and entire races of people.  Speaking of modern day little Hitlers, the Columbine High School shooters carried out their bloody rampage on Hilter's birthday, April 20th, and had planned on causing more than 500 deaths at the high school.  Shooter Eric Harris had written on his website, "YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE??? Natural SELECTION!  It's the best thing that ever happened to the Earth.  Getting rid of all the stupid and weak organisms."  After the bloody rampage, Harris' autopsy report revealed that he was wearing a T-shirt with the words "Natural Selection" emblazoned on the front.  Beware of those who hold this book dear to their hearts.  This book is not about man descending from the apes.  The ideas in this book have caused and continue to cause more deaths than any other notion in modern history 
 The story is unoriginal, convoluted, violent, and completely unbelievable. The plot is reminiscent of his previous book, Three. The characters are severely underdeveloped, and often act and respond in irregular and uncharacteristic ways, given their backgrounds. The dialogue is trite, inconsistent, and unrealistic. It is also a rather violent book, filled with graphic depictions of hangings, shootings, and a character being beaten with a frozen chicken. One scene involves a character being forced to chew on his recently severed finger. Dekker attempts to weave his unrealistic tale into a philosophic exploration of both good vs. evil and the true nature of beauty, but ultimately fails to deliver 
 Before buying this book, I wished I had read the review below that says, "For every winner there is at least one loser. For every big winner generally there are a few losers. The successful ones do study the stock market in detail and they depend upon substantial understanding of the share market system but knowledge is not enough, you need something else as well. If it was simply knowledge and easy, then arrogant inexperienced fools like this writer who are obviously extremely intelligent would have made money instead of losing it."  For one thing if the author knew at least a little bit about stop loss techniques before entering the stock market, he would not have lost so much money with his stock purchases. Maybe he is just so frustated and wants to show how smart he is and that only a random market could beat him as it did. Maybe he just wants to show that with the mathematics he had all he needed to enter the market, that no additional domain knowledge would be needed.  But then he goes on to show how technical analysis is flawed and how smart he is to see this so clearly. As the other reviewer noticed, he quickly jumps to conclusion whenever things don't follow his logic. I could list many cases in this book where his very own analysis is flawed, where his arguments are not well constructed, where the next step is avoided whenever the path could lead to a different conclusion.  I have a Theoretical Physics background and the I-know-it-best position that the author shows does not appeal to me either. Most of his humor seems to be based on a deep-seated sense of arrogance.  Yet, he is an intelligent man. One can hardly believe that this is the same person who wrote his other good books, especially the excellent "Innumeracy". Well, they were more in his domain of knowledge.   But he thinks that knowing Mathematics he knows a lot more than he knows, and a lot more than the average Joe. And the market is unforgiving to people who behave like fools and without proper domain knowledge.  I have given two stars to this book because it happens to be an interesting book for people who works with technical analysis. To find the errors and flawed arguments of an intelligent man trying to beat technical analysis is intellectually gratifying.   It may also turn out to be very enlightening to see how the market turns an intelligent man into a fool if proper domain knowledge is missing. It is a lesson that many learn the hard way.  This book probably has a typo in its title.  
 The book might be ok for a very young reader.  However, from the summary and from the other review, I thought the book would be helpful to a young person with a telescope (to help them find what's out there).  I just received the book today and am returning it because it will certainly not be useful in this way 
 Didn't work for my SD Ultra II on either my iMac OS 10.4.9 or my Windows XP SP2 laptop.  Exchanged for another.  The replacement also doesn't work 
 A Place on Earth is a laborious, read so filled with description and imagined thought processes that the point of the story is never evident.  The character development is not sufficient to entice the reader into really caring for any of the many, many people who wonder through the "Place".  It would be nice if Mr. Berry decided whether to present his ramblings in the past or present tense.  If you are interested in what a valley looked like in Kentucky during World War II, and you have a lot of time to figure out the unnecessarily complex rhetoric, maybe you'll enjoy this book.  If you want a story that invites you to turn to the next page, this ain't the place 
 I just cam from Las Vegas and the sandisk has a disk error that doesn't allow for more photos after only using 40mb. I have tried to format the disk using the camera and through Windows XP. It doesn't allow it to be formatted. Bad investment!!! Would not recommend the product unless there is a way I can get a refund or an exchange 
 I wanted to like this book.  I love Sagas of Icelanders.  I was ecstatic over the Poetic Edda.  Snorri's "Prose Edda" was frequently mentioned in my other reading, and I decided I would have to check it out.  What a disappointment. I must clarify that by saying that the Prose Edda is an EXTREMELY important book of immense value to students of Medeival literature (specifically Scandinavian / Norse / Icelandic.)  It is the single most complete record of  Norse mythology which we have today, and along with the Poetic Edda, constitutes practically the sole source of material for all books which re-tell the mythological stories.  But the Edda is, unfortunately, a book to be read only for the value of the information it contains; not for entertainment.  All of the interesting material in the Edda is re-told (in much more readable ways) elsewhere.  Snorri himself, in the course of this book, re-tells "Voluspa" (from the Poetic Edda) and gives a brief synopsis of the Volsunga Saga. Edda was written as a handbook for poets and scholars, to aid in understanding ancient Scandinavian poetry, which was thick with mythological allusions. Edda also provides guidelines for composing new poems using traditional forms.  It was written two or three centuries into the Christian era of northern Europe, when old pagan lore was already nearly forgotten.  Snorri's book kept his ancestor's cultural heritage from disappearing completely.  He treats the old myths very kindly, but is careful to throw in the obligatory Christian warnings about "false religion."  According to "Gylfaginning," (the first and most interesting part of the Edda) the Norse gods - the Aesir - were originally a tribe of people who migrated to the North from Turkey.  They were veterans of the Trojan War (!) so cultured and technologically advanced that they were regarded as gods by the ignorant folk in the lands they conquered and settled.  According to Snorri, most of the mythological stories are analogous to episodes from the Iliad. The second section of the Edda is called "Skaldskaparmal" and it is very tedious.  It consists of a mythological discussion between Aegir (the sea god) and Bragi (the god of poetry) in which Bragi explains various kinds of kennings.  A kenning is a poetic figure of speech in which a person or object is referred to by describing it in terms of another person or object.  Then that secondary person or object can be referred to by yet another substitute, down to 4 or 5 levels of circumlocution, all of which has to be figured out by the listener to determine exactly what the poet is talking about.  Kennings are like riddles, allegories, metaphors, and allusions rolled all into one.  A fairly detailed myhtological background is required to make sense of them - thus, the reason for the Edda.  A few stories are told which explain some kennings, but gradually Snorri loses track of the "conversation" that initially provided structure for this section, and the reader gets mired amidst interminable lists of poetic synonyms for swords, ships, gold, and so on.  Quotes from old poems illustrate the use of many of the kennings. The translator - for reasons which are certainly valid - opted to render all of the verse as prose, preserving its literal meaning [with allegorical meanings choppily inserted in square brackets,] but utterly detroying its power as POETRY. The final section is called "Hattatal" and it consists of a few verse quotations and three original poems composed by Snorri himself in a different style for each verse, with sections of prose in between stanzas to explain the technical details (rhyme, meter, alliteration, etc) of each style.  There's a total of 102 verses in the Hattatal, and the poetry here is actually somewhat interesting; more so, at least, than the nuts-and-bolts discussion of the fine points of skaldic composition.  In this section, each verse is presented in the original Old Icelandic (with modernized spelling) with English translation underneath. At the end of this volume, the translator has provided a handy eight-page summary that will tell you what you missed and/or forgot as you slogged in a bleary-eyed daze through Skaldskaparmal and Hattatal.  There's also an alphabetical index of names so you can look up things and use the Edda for what it was intended to be: a reference book. I'm glad I read it, I guess, since I am pretty "into" this kind of thing ... but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is just curious about Norse mythology.  Sure, this book is "the Source" but you'll have more fun reading one of the dozens of more recent re-tellings 
 Being a huge fan of Conne Browne, I looked forward to this book- hoping it was better than the last 2. What a disappointment. It seemed the author had set up her own message board and drew tales from other 'queens' to fill this book up.  It's ok for the occasional chuckle, but it seems her run has come to an end 
 I was quite disappointed to find this "book"--pamphlet-sized, large fonts spreading out over sixty plus pages, roughly a paragraph per page--living up to its title. It is really no more than a glorified lecture from an established philosopher who, it would seem, has become big enough to pull a con job on his readers. In the end, Frankfurt takes all this time to reach the conclusion that BS is different from lying, in my opinion hardly worth the paper it's printed on. All in all, an inconsequential and not very entertaining analytical exercise by an emeritus academic with too much time on his hands. If you want to read a work that lives up to being called "entertaining" and "enlightening" you could try "From Lowbrow to Nobrow" (2006).     
 After reading the first book *(which was catastropha) and reading the second which was really good, I thought that the series is taking off, I was mistaken, the third book is slow, and boring, you can see very well that Stephan king has no Idea what so ever where he is going to take that series  Nothing much is happening, and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas, the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find (And better written as well) in dragon lance series, or other adventure books, also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books,  reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book, which some say is very boring  I guess this is where the adventure end for me.. 
 I've been a Beastie Boys fan since I was in 8 years old. I played the cassette version of License to Ill until it did nothing but make a squealing sound in my head phones. And until a while ago I would maintain to anyone that EVERY Beastie Boys album was great, cool in its own right and an evolutionary step forward by some of hip hop's most talented artists. (Get to the point. I know, I know.) But I had never really owned "Hello Nasty' myself. It was the only one of their albums I hadn't picked upon release. Until recently.  Now, upon closer inspection reveals that there really isn't a stand out track on the whole album. "Intergalactic," "Body Movin'" and "Super Disco Breakin'" may have been pseudo hits but they don't really stand out from the rest of the album, which feels like mostly filler. Decent filler, though. There are a few stinkers: "Song for the Man" (It's cool when they try to do new things and the lyrics are interesting, but this track is utterly skippable) and Dedication (following House of Pain's shout out track lead is indulgent and just plain boring to listen to).  Like their previous two LPs, there are a few decent instrumental track that break up the album. But in general the whole album seems to pass unnoticed. I listened to it 4 times in a row while at work an couldn't really discern any standout track. But for what it's worth, I wasn't annoyed.   All in all it's cool to hear the B-Boys make a cohesive album with a unique sound, but it's not mind blowing. I'd recommend it for serious fans and people collecting all their CDs. It's certainly won't detract from your collection and there will be a time you'll want to listen to it. But I wouldn't expect to find yourself picking it over Paul's Boutique, Check Your Head or even To The 5 Boroughs (awesome, by the way) for that matter. 
    If you are looking for something shocking, don't bother with this movie.      rape scene:  why doesn't she run???? why doesn't she fight??? how come there's all this blood on her all of a sudden??? where did that come from???? stupid.                                                            revenge scenes:  first of all, i wasn't upset enough to thirst for revenge.  second of all, the murder scenes were even weaker than the rape scene.      what you've basically got here is a movie hollywood could remake, scene for scene, including every gratuitous moment. and it would get made.  it would show in theaters.  and lots of annoying people would think it was horrifying.  go rent "irreversible" it's much better at this sort of thing.               
 Hmmm....if you're a member of the conservative Christian right you might like this one. However, I highly recommend "Capitate Your Kids" for a great guide to teaching your teen to be financially frugal and smart 
 The Claim purports to be an adaptation of Thomas Hardy's classic novel, The Mayor of Casterbridge transplanted to the Old West. The producers clearly wanted The Claim to be accepted as a literate Western and it is clear that the critics fell for it. However, as anyone who has read the original Hardy novel can tell you, the movie fails as a Hardy adaptation. Meanwhile, any fan of movie westerns can tell you that The Claim is a failure in that department as well.  The Claim begins in 1869 where Daniel Dillon (Peter Mullan) lords supreme over his company town. His gold mining company is a topflight operation. Dillon is easily one of the most admired men in California, if not in the nation. However, Dillon is not a terribly happy man. Deep down, he broods over a dark secret that, if exposed, could lead to the destruction of his reputation.  You see, the gold claim was originally made by another man, but Dillon sold his wife and daughter to the original claimant in exchange for the claim. The prospector thereupon took both wife and child to Boston and raised the family there. Meanwhile, Dillon ruthlessly exploited the gold claim to become one of the richest men in all of California. Needless to say, if it became public knowldege that Dillon's success was based on the sale of human beings, that would be nothing short of disastrous.  Matters are brought to a head when his wife (Nastassja Kinski), daughter (Milla Jovovich) and his wife's subsequent daughter with the other man (Sarah Polley) show up in town and request that he take them in as his family. Just when you think that things are going to get interesting, the rug is pulled out from the audience's feet when it is revealed that Dillon conveniently never married after making his dirty deal. This enabled him to marry his ex-wife without never having to publically admit that they were previously married or what happened to that union. This effectively removed all dramatic tension and helped make The Claim a colossal bore 
 This little pamphlet is for senior citizens wishing to leave the story of their lives to their grandchildren. It states the few obvious things that such a one needs to do. It is not for anyone wishing to try to write 
 I've read Wicked first and perhaps that was where the mistake lies. Wicked was so well written that after reading such a great novel, Confessions was somewhat of a disappointment. It's not a bad novel but the character development was just par and the storyline seemed a bit forced. I would love to recommend Wicked though for those who might be interested. I even bought the soundtrack from the Broadway show 
 I know APR is supposed to be one of the better poetry magazines out there, and I think it has one of the highest circulations of any poetry magazine, but it's more of the National Enquirer of poetry magazines. It's a large, newspaper-style format that contains mostly bad poetry and dull articles. You'd be better off subscribing to Poetry, The Hudson Review, The Texas Review, Tar River Poetry, or any number of other journals 
 I can't get into this book nor can I find what I'm looking for because it's not broke down well. "Make up Don't Break up" is WAY better and explains why people are "scared" 
 Some people complain that this book has no romance.  Others complain that the mystery is too dark.  My complaint is that I don't know what world Kay Hooper's characters are operating in but it isn't our world.  Never mind the fact that the major premise of this series is that there is a special unit of FBI agents who have psychic powers.  I can live with that.  I can live with them facing a host of otherworld nasties.  What I can't put up with is the failure of basic common sense.  For instance.  There is a maid at a fancy resort who is pregnant by one of the guests.  She is worried about her pregnancy showing because she knows she is going to be fired.  What!?!   Then what will she do to support herself?  What!?!  First, if they fire her because she is pregnant she gets a lawyer and sues their money out of their pocket.  She also notifies the father that he has another mouth to feed and had better get ready to hand over child support.    I've seen this nonesense in romance novels so often that I kind of expect it there, but this is not supposed to be a romance.  Now, as to the mystery part:  this special FBI unit would be far better off if they would stop depending on their psychic abilities so much and do a little gum shoeing.  A child is kidnapped and taken far from the place where she was last seen to a cabin in the mountains. Our dauntless FBI agents find her by psychic means (This isn't a spoiler, it's part of the back story)  and 1) do not take the child to the hospital for examination; 2) do not call in forensic people to search and process the cabin for evidence of the identity of the abductor; and 3) do not seem to follow up at all in a rational, FBI sort of way.    So if you want no romance with all the romance nonsense about the way the world works, a mystery that could have been solved briskly with a little digging into the circumstances and characters that are paper thin at best, then grab this book at once.   
 "The Beast in the Jungle" is the most effective sleeping pill you are likely to find anywhere. I challenge any reader to go through this text in one sitting and not falling asleep or, at least, not to experiment a tremendous mind-numbing feeling. Of course, I haven't read all the books in the world, but I dare say that this is the most boring piece of writing ever conceived by anyone. I find it very hard to imagine something more awful than this. It's absolutely impossible, unsurpassable.  Henry James' style is so artificially conceited and pompous that you have to ask yourself if the trash he used to write wasn't a very calculated joke after all or if he's just trying to take the reader for a ride (a ride into a world of dullness and boredom, that is). The supposedly "psychological insight" of James is just a mere exercise in nothingness, the highest form of pretentiousness in its purest expression.   In this short???-story (James wasn't very strong on things like "precision" and "conciseness"), the terrible fate that seems to be in store for the main character after pages and pages of monotonous text, turns out to be that "nothing is to happen to him". Pathetic and childish. In my opinion, "The Beast in the Jungle" is the greatest proof that James was a dreadful writer (not to say "an insipid donkey").  Actually, James is so comical as to excite parody. In the old days H.G. Wells likened his prose to an hippopotamus pushing a pea and Ambrose Bierce said that James' work would benefit if someone took the pain to translate it into English. I personally agree with the two of them but, you know, many things that in the past have been judged as "ridiculous" or "stupid" are considered today, through some arbitrary process known as "reassessment of literary figures", as something pretty relevant and sophisticated. That's life, isn't it?.  "The Beast in the Jungle" is a poor story that serves James as an excuse for writing a lot and not to say anything significant. Completely worthless. In case I had to choose, I'd prefer to read a telephone directory instead.  Of course, this prime example of literary incompetence is regarded as a masterpiece by many scholars.  Well, each to his own.. 
 I was expecting a fun CD that I could pop in when I'm getting ready for a girls night out, but was extremely disappointed.  There was only one song that made it worth buying and that is the cover of Fly.  
                  As you can tell by the header, I was disappointed by this movie. Since Kurt Russell plays the lead, I should not have been surprised, because the parts he plays are generally rather predictable and simplistic (Tango & Cash, Snake Plisskin, etc). I just don't picture Kurt as lead actor in a gritty, realistic drama...but, eternally the optimist, I hoped that this might be the exception. It wasn't.  The story involves two LA detectives, one a grizzled and thoroughly corrupt veteran (Russell) and the other a somewhat principled but weak-willed and easily manipulated rookie, Bobby Keough (Scott Speedman). Russell's character (Eldon Perry) is controlled and protected by an exceedingly corrupt superior officer, Jack Van Meter (nicely played by Brendan Gleeson), who uses Perry to further his profitable and flagrantly illegal interests.   If you have ever watched "The Shield" on FX cable network then you will be familiar with this general setup....a morally ambiguous detective is used to further his superior's agenda.....but here is the problem: The Shield (a television series) is vastly superior in every way: plot, acting, characterization, dialog, direction, etc. to this feature film. It is like comparing filet mignon to cheap hamburger. Once you see a quality, nuanced drama like The Shield, this movie and all like it are rendered unwatchable.   Characters in Dark Blue are caricatures with almost no depth. They guzzle whiskey and laugh about their flagrant crimes. The plot and dialog are contrived and unrealistic. There is no subtlety....no intellectually stimulating complexity. Eldon always does exactly as he is told: if mass-murdering thugs (employed and protected by his superior) are to be sheltered from arrest, simply go out and murder a couple of stray ex-cons and let them take the rap (posthumously) for the real criminals. Never mind that neither of the ex-cons is even close to being a plausible suspect. No one would be fooled by this ruse, except perhaps in this mindless movie.   Eldon gets his partner Keough to perform one of the cold-blooded murders ordered by Van Meter, and thus begins their downfall, because Keough has a spontaneous change of heart and suddenly cannot accept the guilt of his actions. One minute he is guzzling whiskey with his cronies and laughing about lying to a shooting review board, and the next he is overwrought with guilt. Not at all likely in real life, but it suits the plot.   Things gets even sillier when the partner (Speedman) then teams up with the assistant chief's (Ving Rhames) predictably beautiful ex-mistress (Michael Michelle) to try to arrest the real thugs and use them to bring down the whole perverted mess. Heaven forbid that he simply come forth and provide evidence to accomplish this end. What follows is a lengthy, confused, and poorly choreographed pursuit of the thugs and a predictable gun battle with equally predictable outcome.   The ultimate farce, however, is reserved for Eldon himself, who drives around South Central Los Angeles during the peak of the Rodney King riots trying to find and arrest a black suspect....which he easily accomplishes....and then drives away without a scratch. This reaches the level of surrealistic absurdity and is an insult to the true horror of the riots.  Equally unconvincing is Eldon's spontaneous change of heart at the end of the movie, during his promotion ceremony (such irony), when he delivers a rambling, preposterous and unconvincing indictment of his father, himself, and his evil superior....which is simplistically and immediately accepted (in true movie fashion) by all who hear it, and who then immediately jump to arrest and condemn the naughty superior. This is silly, implausible, and an insult to any viewer above the age (and maturity) of a 10-year old. Jump up at your next promotion ceremony and deliver a rambling condemnation of your superior and see what happens. This type of naive nonsense occurs in only one place: the movies....bad ones.   If you were thrilled by Tango & Cash, and thought Snake Plissken was a brilliantly-portrayed anti-hero, then by all means hit the "Buy It Now" button for this DVD. But, if you want complexity, subtlety, realism, plausibility, and infinitely superior acting, plot, characterization, and direction....do yourself a huge favor and use your money to either subscribe to FX on cable, or buy/rent DVD's of The Shield series....filet mignon is always better than cheap hamburger 
 I thought I was saving a little by buying this scale but it arrived with dead batteries which cost another $15.00 to replace. It also only works half the time, displaying very low or very high numbers, it has to be "reset" often in order to display the right numbers 
 The 5x7 digital photo frame from Pacific Digital is very cheaply made, the lcd is very dark and flickers constantly. 
 I guess I was hoping for more about the company and people. This book has lots of pictures and ads with some discriptions of the guns. It's not what I thought I was getting, the title should be changed to a "Pictorial of The First 100 yeras of Daisy Guns" 
 It's clear that Mr. Goldberg is hurt by his personal and professional troubles with CBS and Dan Rather.  It is made even clearer by the fact that he constantly brings it up over and over again throughout most of this book.    This "book", for being written by someone who is outraged over the media bias, is incredibly unprofessional, full of hyperbole, personal rants, and very little decorum.  If Goldberg wants to convince us that the media has a liberal slant, he would be much better off keeping his own opinions to himself and write a centered book based on facts.  BIAS feels like a personal vendetta against Rather, against CBS, and I suspect that Goldberg had some aspirations for greatness in his return to CBS, was denied, and, in turn, wrote this scathing book as revenge 
 I've seen Amy Sohn on TV a few times and decided to check out this novel at B&N. I finished about half of it, just out of sheer curiosity and obviously didn't purchase it. It's amusing if only because of what poorly written, self-important, right out of the gutter sewer sludge it is. The protaganist is self-absorbed, humorless and unlikeable. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be satirical or some kind of ironic twist on this sort of coming-of-age-20-something-hip-post-feminist genre, but I'm afraid it's not because I think the author expects us to actually RELATE to the main character and take her seriously 
 She has some rockin songs on here. All her singles kickass and the last song on the album with M.I.A. (i friggin love her) is fire. but then, i start listening to the other songs, ready for a song on the album that is just as good as her singles and i can't find another. All of missy's singles are crazy, but then ui listen to the album, and its like a let down. any song that she sings in makes my stomach churn and some have just annoying beats and repititious phrases. If you really liked Missy's album 'This Is Not A Test', then get this album. but if you are lovin her singles and want some more, just download the singles, don't waste your money on the rest of this album. 
 Here's a fantastic idea: Let's make a documentary about someone about whom there is virtually NO information, just bits and pieces culled from the memories of strangers who came into contact with him once or twice some 30-odd years ago, who accomplished absolutely nothing save for writing and illustrating a voluminous fantasy novel that no one will ever read.  I guess his art is okay, I just don't really think there is ANYTHING about a reclusive old janitor who wrote a book that is remotely interesting, and in my opinion, the filmmakers did nothing to convince me otherwise. 
 I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.  The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.    What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.  I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book 
 I love this movie (see rating), but what's the point of making a movie available for download in 4:3 that was shot in 65mm panavision? What a waste. I'd rather wait a few months.. 
 Leading Evangelical theologian Wayne Grudem continues his mission of defining and defending the "complimentarian position" with his very fluent pen. It is no secret that Grudem finds the controversy over the role of women in the home and in the church to be the most important issue Evangelicals face today. He warns that there is a connection between evangelical feminism (egalitarianism) and liberalism, and believes the current state of evangelicalism regarding manhood and womanhood is in need of desperate revision. Grudem amplifies his polemicist skills by interacting with over 100 egalitarian arguments and stops short of denouncing them as heretical.   Yet, despite 800 poised pages to the contrary, I still am not able to see the logic in Grudem's positions. Doug Groothuis illuminates (see his review of Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood), 1) the Bible is true in all that it teaches, 2) Men and women are equal in value as human beings and essential human capacity, and 3) God ordains men to be in authority over women cross-culturally and perpetually. These three propositions cannot all be true, because if (2) is true (3) cannot be true, since (3) restricts women and confirms that they are not equal to men. If the Bible teaches both (2) and (3) to be true, the Bible itself teaches errors, thus contradicting (1).   Nevertheless, Grudem takes 25 years of scholarship and packages it neatly into one volume that is readable and accessible 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 The product description says: "Includes drivers for Mac OS 9.1 and later, and for Windows 95/98/ME/2000 "  This is a lie. Once you get the product, set it up, fail to install and go to the web site it says "does not support windows 98".  Who knows what they do support. Don't buy it.   
 I love Philip K. Dick's books (almost all of them, and I'm pretty sure I've read just about all of them over the years). But I have a strong suspicion that he wrote Now Wait for Last Year when he was a kid and had it published after his writing credentials had been secured. In the book, he uses a lot of big words (for an S.F. writer), but he doesn't seem to know how to use them properly. And he doesn't know how to use the English language properly, either. There's no way this book could have been published on its own, with no famous author's name on it. The plot is excellent, and true PK Dickian. But I had a VERY hard time finishing it because of the astonishingly bad writing (it's his style, but the awkwardness of the syntax and word usage is like driving on a pot-holed road). Any other book of his is better. Read this one last 
 Like some of the other reviewers, this was pretty much the first book I ever read on the subject, but later as I studied more, I discovered that Wilson has so filled this book with bias and irrelevancy as to make it virtually useless.  It's only saving grace is that so many players in the game are namechecked that the interested student will at least know where to look.  There is also the final chapter, "Glimpses", which might have made a good small book on its own, with its discussion of "Faculty X", that I rather liked.  On the whole though, I can't say that the brand new edition is worth it--you'd be better off purchasing this one from an Amazon Seller 
 I ordered this book for my son because I thought it would be a cute and entertaining story.  I was extremely disappointed to find out that it was neither cute nor entertaining.  The plot and characters are very shallow and simplistic, although that is not the problem I have with this book.  The problem is the writing style.  It is written in a very colloquial style and has no literary flair whatsoever.  If you are looking for a sweet, funny undersea story to read your young one, look elsewhere.  This one lacks quality and refinement 
 I bought this recharger kit specifically for a Sandisk m230 mp3 player.  When I first received the kit, I charged all of the batteries.  Upon first use I only got 7min. out of each battery, when I got 20 hrs. from the batter sent with the player.  I learned online that the batteries still have their charge, but due to the battery's "memory effect" or "voltage depression," my player thinks the batteries have lost their charge after only 7min.    If you are buying batteries for an electronic device that detects how much "juice" is left in a battery, do not buy this kit 
 I don't think SheDaisy will last much longer.  A remix album??  SheDaisy is pulling a Paula Abdul: releasing a remix album just to sell a few more copies.  I had this album for 2 hours and returned it to the store for something else. Seriously, this is very dissappointing.  They are seriously pushing the line of country-pop.. they should re-consider their image and just focus on doing just pop 
 Once is forgivable, but second one? I know money is really tempting, but you are losing my respect here.... 
 If this really were THE BEST American travel writing, the genre would be in trouble.  Perhaps a better title would help avoid disappointed readers - as only a few of the episodes take place in America (South America, Greenland, Haiti, included) and most of the authors are British in style.  There is little observation, little information, little of interest, and little variety.  The book seems to start with the premise that for travel writing to be interesting, the locale MUST be dangerous, remote, or unlikely.  Oddly, the selections seems to be examples of exactly what Theroux indicated travel writing should NOT be in his overly long and not very interesting introduction.  The work would probably most appeal to someone interested in places where most travelers will never go.  For most readers, there are plenty of other books to turn to instead that I believe would be far more rewarding 
 This book is about a Jewish girl named Hannah Green who flees from Spain in fear of the Spanish Inquisition after witnessing her mother being captured and burned alive at the stakes for being a Jew.  She comes to England with her father and lives as a Christian while following the Jewish religion in secrecy.  Through a chain of events she becomes a royal fool and a spy - for both Queen Mary and Elizabeth.   Throughout the book Hannah talks about how she misses her mother and can still smell her mother's burning flesh from the stakes and then also professes her love for Queen Mary and what a wonderful woman she is.  It is well documented in history as well as this book about Queen Mary's burning of hundreds of non-Catholics at the stakes.  A practice that earned her the name - Bloody Mary.  The book is very sympathetic towards Queen Mary and portrays her as a virtuous woman who believed that she was burning people for their own sake - "only doing what she believed to be right in her heart".    The fact that Hannah was living her life in fear of being discovered as a Jew and continued to deeply love Queen Mary was extremely unbelievable and ridiculous. I could not help but roll my eyes every time I read how much Hannah loved and admired Queen Mary.  
 I was outraged in reading this book.  I can't imagine why someone who obviously has absolutely no faith would write a biography of Mary.  Other than being an insult to anyone of faith, it is not a biography at all, but a book about the times that Mary lived in.  It is quite clear that the author has no knowledge of the biblical Mary and no understanding of faith or Christianity.  Don't waste your money or time on this book. I had to give this book one star, but it deserved none 
 The book does cover some business relationship basics.  But, it has been covered in many other books and nothing new was received from reading this book.    The book came with a CD.  The CD was poorly made.  Too bad I listened to the CD first.  It gave me a bad first impression and that may have carried over to reading the book.    The book did not keep my attention.  I have three types of books.  There are those that I can't put down.  There are others that I throw away after the first 100 pages. And, there are those that I read a little every day when I am on the stationary bike at the gym.  This was a bike read because I couldn't handle it for too long.  
 My girlfriend just bought this couch from amazon. This is by visiondecor furniture. First it shows up on the curbside in pieces. Did you ever hear of a couch in pieces and that you actually have to put it together? This is not including the cushions. The material is loose and very cheap looking and the frame is flimsy. I don't know if it will last a year. IKEA furniture is actually better quality. Paid around $550 with shipping, if she would have spent another $200 she would have a great quality couch from one of the local furniture stores in Los Angeles. She is very disappointed and wants to cry. Sad, very sad... 
 I'm surprised by all the rave reviews this book has received here.  True, the illustrations are beautiful.  However, the story is about a series of events that culminates with a monkey killing a baby owl (with an illustration of the poor little owl getting clunked on the head), and then progresses with the mother owl's mourning period.  My 3 year old and I both find it disturbing -- not exactly a good bedtime read 
 Snoop comes with a very disappointing third effort and first on No Limit since leaving the Death Row Empire.  All in all this cd has quite a few below average tracks and only one great one and about 6-8 good ones (21 total songs are on the cd so only about 40% of the cd is quality).  Features too many songs with No Limit artists (something they are known for).  The production is too southern for Snoop's delivery and style and it effects the quality of the cd (Beats by the Pound make some tight beats but they don't fit Snoop well with too many of the songs on here).  #1 - 7.5 (f/ Master P) #2 - 7.5 (decent slowed down song - f/ Mia X & O"Dell) #3 - 4 (f/ Fiend & mystikal) #4 - 6.5 #5 - 4 #6 - 3 #7 - 5 #8 - 4 (f/ Mystikal) #9 - 9.5 (great g-funk beat - f/ Master P on the hook) #10 - 10 (a classic - definately the best song on the cd) #11 - 6.5 (f/ Soulja Slim (R.I.P.), Silkk the Shocker & Fiend) #12 - 5 (f/ Master P & Silkk the Shocker) #13 - 8 (f/ Silkk & C-Murder) #14 - 8 (f/ C-Murder - remake of NWA's "Gangsta Gangsta") #15 - 8.5 (gangsta track - f/ Steady Mobb'n) #16 - 7.5 (f/ C-Murder & Mystikal) #18 - 3 (f/ Mia X) #19 - 8 #20 - 8 (produced by Soppafly & Daz) #21 - 7 (F/ Master P - samples "Bout It Bout It" beat)  b.

 Zukav has a decidedly anti-Western tone and is obviously biased in favor of oriental thinking.  This is new age gobbledegook passed off as a bare bones reader on physics.  Rather than writing a laconic outline of physics, Zukav spends the majority of his time praising Eastern thought and toying with the idea that everything is subjective.    The reader is referred to any college physics textbook or Isaac Asimov's History of Physics or a good set of encylopedias.   
 This was an interestng diversion but hardly the masterpiece that I was led to expect. Pretty ordinary 
 I have tried to read this book. I read for 150 pages before I realized that this book is not for me. There are many reviewers who have abundant praises for Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty. I cannot count myself as one of them. Perhaps I have not read enough novels, by Austen, Dickens, or other British writers to understand the significance of this latest addition. I almost expected to be regaled with politics of Thatcher; instead, I plodded through descriptions after descriptions.  I might be wrong, but I got no sense that these descriptions were supposed to highlight class differences in British society. Perhaps there were allusions that I, by virtue of not reading those alluded, could not understand. Perhaps it was the dialogue that shows class difference between how people talk. Still, I did not know enough about British society to understand this humor.  Therefore, I did not like the book. You can say I am too unsophisticated. It does not matter. I did not see anything that might be timeless, or timely to a generation born in the 24th century 
 how all yall fools gonna come up in here calling this trash gangsta.. Kali is where the real ridas live and die notthe dirty..

 Readers here are always quick to revolt against 1-star reviews of respected figures, but hear me out here. I'm a big fan of Pierre Boulez, and not a day goes by when I don't delight in some of his great works like "...explosante-fixe...", "Sur Incises", and "Repons". This disc, however, is a disaster from an otherwise heroic composer.  "Pli selon pli"  for soprano and orchestra is a lengthy setting of poems by Stephane Mallarme, whose idea of a work in "perpetual expansion" preoccupied Boulez for much of the 1950s. The work grew in stages. It began first with three "Improvisations sur Mallarme" for voice and small ensemble in 1958 and 1959. Then a grim end, "Tombeau" for large orchestra, was added later in 1959. Finally, in 1960 the work gained an introduction with "Don" for large orchestra, whose opening big tutti chord will sound familiar to anyone familiar with Luciano Berio's "Sinfonia" (where it's quoted in the passage "I have a present for you" *whomp*). Originally the order of many elements were left to the discretion of the conductor, a form similar to that of the Piano Sonata No. 3 and "Eclat", but Boulez ultimately fixed the parts in the order they are here. The completed work has been revise several times since its introduction, and various versions have been recorded. This recording is of the latest revision, that of 1989.  Along with "Le Marteau Sans Maitre" of 1953-1955, "Pli selon pli" ushers out the bleep-bloops and Webern-inspired crystal sounds of early Boulez and introduces the interest in wide contrasts of timbre and the warm tones of alto range that marks all of his subsequent work. The forces of a traditional ensemble are accompanied by guitar and mandolin, and while the soprano has a decisive role, her intonations serve more as exotic instrument in the ensemble than a communicator of poetry.  Unfortunately, "Pli selon pli" is a rather unfocused work, for certain moments drag on for far too long than they should. There can indeed be moments of immense wonder here, the general exploration of the ensemble's capabilities, the soprano's wild gesticulations, and especially the grimly beautiful end, which is among Boulez's most frenetic writing. On the 1969 recording on Sony where Boulez leads the soprano Halina Lukomska and the BBC Symphony Orchestra, there's a good aggression about the performance that overcomes the sluggish parts to make for a three-star listening.  On this revised version, however, those dragging moments drag on even longer, and Boulez's conducting lacks any of the old violence. It's over an hour of extremely sluggish pacing, and the result is unlistenable. I can't believe that at the same time Boulez did this revision, he was at work on the new version of "...explosante-fixe...", one of the most wild and exuberant pieces I've ever heard.  "Pli selon pli" for me has never ranked among Boulez's best work, though at least on the Sony recording it was entertaining enough. But I can't find much good to say about this performance 
 I have long been a Dowd column reader, along with a half dozen other opinion page writers, and picked up this book at our local library.  There are many reasons why one writes a book, you have a story to tell, your editor / publisher gives you an idea, you want to keep your name before the public, you need the money, just to list a few.  I can't think that Dowd needs the money, unless she is being bribed because someone found out she is actually a conservative!  I also don't believe that she has the visceral need to keep her name before her public.  If she had a story to tell, one would think that it would be told in a more convincing, thoughtful manner.  Since I am male and a grandparent, I'm guessing that I am not the target audience for this book, and the positive reviews from several potential career women would seem to corraborate that they are the intended audience.  And herein lies one of my problems with Ms Dowd and this book.  It appears to have been written by a mid to late 30's woman surprised to find out that her options are running out, not by the 50 plus year old that she is!  Those of you with 50 year old mothers or aunts, I ask you, do they talk like this?  Is this the kind of advice you would expect from them?  Or has Ms Dowd, at least emotionally, stopped growing at about the same age as the ladies from 'Sex in the City'?  I expected a significantly more mature viewpoint from her.  I also quibble with several other points she attempts to make:  That Hillary killed feminism.  Well she didn't.  Feminism is alive and well, just ask my sisters, wife and daughter.  Some feminists lost their credibility attempting to defend Bubba's actions with Monica L (moral relativism), but what killed that part of feminism which was based on the supposed male belief that women were not their equals, was its internal inconsistencies---the same thing that doomed the USSR!  Please try to tell my wife that men are her equal when she had been leading her family--three brothers just like Ms Dowd--since she was 12!    Yes, drugs and plastic surgery are a problem--for folks with too much disposable income and too little to keep them out of trouble!  New York, LA and DC,while fine cities all, are not the entire US, and what passes for currently acceptable behavour, among the elite in those three cities, just isn't on the average person's radar.    As earlier reviewers have said, other writers have made the same arguments, much better, so I am left not having a reason why this book was written.  I am left with an hypothesis only, that Ms Dowd is questioning decisions she made over the last three decades, trade offs, questionable choices, etc. and is wrestling with those, not having yet come to a conclusion.  My data points are her lack of a response to Monica L; her acceptance of the job after her potential boss hits on her, giving a bye to Anita Hill for somewhat similar behavour, ditto Hillary.  I wonder what those nun she had in school would say?  As commented in the book vis a vis Elizabeth Vargas' removal from the Evening News, perhaps she doesn't have the 'gravitas' to write a book?  Or as Helen Gurley Brown said of Ms Dowd's initial effort for Cosmo 'pure pablum' 
 Beautiful prose is not enought to save this book. I enjoyed the first third and was moved by the loss of Beverly Penn, but by the end of the tome I frankly didn't care who lived or died when the Apocalypse arrived. It was a surprise to find out that only middle class urban journalists and their friends will actually go to heaven while the poor burn in their hovels. Having said that, Helprin is capable of writing a great novel;  A Soldier of The Great War remains one of my favourites 
 I like to find an author and read all their books, not necessarily in order. I find that I get a great liking/disliking for them and decide if I will continue. I found CC's books to be good with the first FBI book I read with Dane Carver. It was good. Damsel in distress and FBI agent friend falls in love with her and they marry all live happily ever after. Then there is the one with the detective, Ben. Guess what,  he falls in love with the damsel in distress and they get married. Then there is Mac and Quinlan, both FBI agent friends of Savich/Sherlock - they too fall madly in love with the women they are protecting/investigating and get married and live happily ever after. Now I am all for a nice romantic twist in a book but it happens in EVERY one. Don't forget the MAZE where Savich and Sherlock fall in love. I did not dislike any of those books but it did get a bit mundane when I started seeing the same outline for the plot there. A lot of the same use of dialogue and words starting popping off the page at me. Just not a lot of new material to hold the interest.   HEMLOCK BAY was just too much to take. I like the characters Savich and Sherlock - they are certainly written as superagents and superparents. I even liked Lily and Simon in this one. BUT and here the big BUT, the plot! It was just too winding, too unrealistic (not even counting the unexplained supernatural things) and just too far fetched. I was disappointed with this read. Will I read more? Well I have one more of the FBI series here to finish the whole set so yes I will. I will not recommend many of them to friends. I think CC had a great thing going and just went off on a tangent as many of the best selling authors do such as Cornwell (was my favorite until the last few books become recipe plots as well), Grafton (who I had to read five to confirm they were as bad as I had thought on the first one) and Patterson (yes even the great one has some that were actual groaners).  I read a lot - a book every day and a half is what it works out to so I buy several at one time. I just found this to be a waste of my time and very depressing that a best selling author would consider this to be up to par. The recipe is now old and needs perked up. Time to change the ingredients and spice it up 
 I just finished listening to as much of the book on CD as I could stomach.  The minutia and lack of knowledge of police terminology and tactics was nauseating.  The words forhead, perp, peruse, crim, and finger were repeated over and over and over.  What might have been a good story in half the words was ruined by descriptions of everyone's clothing, spouses, children, and thinking 
 Sorry, but I found this book a total waste of time. I never did like the main character - I found HER boring! I laughed out loud when I read another reviewer say that "this person escaped her life to be a secretary?" - good point! It was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this "new" life without really taking time to search her soul. Instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I couldn't have cared less what happened to her anyway! After reading it (book on tape) I felt I had totally wasted my time. What a disappointment 
 I was going to be open minded when reading this book. After reading the "student" part, knew that somethings were not right in this book. Any Christian book I have ever read quotes scriptures from the Holy Bible, this one did not. There was just enough truth to keep a Christian still reading. The bible says in the end times there will be false doctorine. This is a very good example. When I got to the back of the book, the teacher section, then the truth of the book came out. Anytime subjects like, "psychic," "magic," and "reincarnation," are talked about and viewed in a positive light,as was the case in the back of this book, then be very careful. If you know the Holy Bible, God's word, then you know that this is of the enemy, Satan. I am not a "holy roller" a "fanatic" I am a Christian that has a personal relationship with Jesus. Ask God what he thinks of this book and its content. How deceptive this book is, just like the enemy. It has just enough truth and then in the very back after you have read all of the things in it, the bomb is dropped and the real stuff comes through loud and clear, or not so clear to those who do not read and know The Bible themselves. Always read God's word, the Holy Bible for yourself. You need to know the truth so you will not be deceived by books and things such as these that are in this book. I really hope people read this and find the truth out for themselves.  Kell 
 Dr. Rieux, the main character of the novel, moves throughout the book in a detached surreal hopeless manner.  He goes thru the motions of "doing his job" while death surrounds him from a wide spread and accelerating plague.  I find Jose Saramago's "Blindess" to be a far superior book to The Plague.  Similar theme and concept but more descriptive and moving.  The Plague was clinical in its approach - almost bloodless.  I found this highly acclaimed book to be very difficult to re-read, often having to re-read many pages over and over.  I would pass on this book 
 GIVEN KERIK'S REPORTED MOB TIES, AMORALITY AND CASHING IN ON THE 9/11 TRAGEDY, IT'S NO SURPRISE TO READ THIS CON JOB PIECE OF FICTION. HIS GHOSTWRITER IS PROBABLY A FICTION WRITER BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT IS WELL WRITTEN, THE STORY IS A FRAUD. WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IN SAUDI ARABIA? HE STALKED AND TERRORIZED WOMEN ACCORDING TO THE WASHINGTON POST. WHY DIDN'T MR. LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO CLAIMED TO BE SO HIGHLY SKILLED THAT HE COULD TRACK DOWN THE BIGGEST DRUG LORDS IN THE WORLD...TRACK DOWN HIS OWN INFANT DAUGHTER --THE ONE HE ABANDONED? HOW ABOUT THE TRUTH? HE IS A CON MAN, ABANDONED HIS OWN CHILD, IS EGOMANIACAL AND IS NOTHING MORE THAN A THUG. HE WRITES ABOUT SOME TEACHER IN SCHOOL WHO TOLD HIM HE WOULD NEVER AMOUNT TO ANYTHING. GUESS WHAT? HE WAS RIGHT. BERNARD KERIK IS JUST WHAT THAT TEACHER SAID HE'D BE. A BIG ZERO 
 I do usability inspections as part of my job.  I bought this book based on Nielsen's reputation and the description of this book here on Amazon.com.  I was very disappointed to find that this book was scholarly, not practical.  After scanning the book, I returned it for refund 
 So I decided maybe I'll give this exploitation thing a try considering I love gore,violence, and horror movies. The reason I give it a 1 star is because it just isn't that good of a movie. It's VERY boring for most of the movie. About the first 20 or so minutes few words are even said. Then the guys just rape this woman several times, then she comes back for a very unsatisfying revenge. It's very slow paced and doesn't live up to the hype. It isn't all that gory, and it isn't scary either. Also, the rape isn't that convincing. I'm not saying I need everything shown in detail, but the acting is so bad it makes it seem as if its not even a big deal. Oh, and the woman gets revenge on one of the men who raped her...and he was practically mentally retarded. The guy really just fell in with the wrong crowd and they convinced him to do something bad. That is not grounds for what she did to him, which in my opinion was the worst of the killings. Anyways. not that good of a movie, don't let the lure of sleaze and violence make you think it will be worth your time because its not 
 While containing a number of intersting plans for small homes, this book falls short on several accounds.  First, there is almost no text save what is on the inside of the jacket.  That's right: no introduction, no methodology.  There is no explanation of which competitions the plans were taken from or what awards they won. (Amusingly, I went to show my neighbor one of the plans that I liked.  He said he liked it too but that it was an old plan from a competition in the early 90's. And would you believe that he happened to have a copy of the competition from which the plan was taken!)     Secondly, as to the plans themselves, dimensions are rarely marked and often unclearly.  In the case of two or three of the plans this makes them nearly unintelligable.   The lack of wall sections or descriptions of materials used for the majority of the plans makes it impossible to understand the particulars of what makes the houses energy effecient.   In short, the book far from lives up to its description and isn't worth spending the money for a handful of plans since a person can look at plans all day long for free online.   
 Very seldom do I give up on a book; I gave up on this one after several attempts to finish.  I have read Barbara Delinsky in the past and have enjoyed her books. I remember the fascination with the Peyton Place/Grace Metalious hoopla in the 50's and 60's so I was expecting to enjoy this story.  It is dull and tiresome.   
 I bought a 700 series iRiver to use at the gym, which came with this Armband, at first it was great, but it didn't last, there are two clasps which don't sta attcked well, and the pocket that holds the mp3 player itself is held together with a glue that comes undone after a few weeks of daily use 
 Top does not heat up enough to sear what you put into the pan. Also, it's very, very hard to clean. I am really disappointed by this product 
 I'm not sure how many "Complete Guides to vampires" the world really needs.  I'm pretty sure we didn't need this.  Most of this stuff is available for free on the internet, or on Wikipedia or similar sites.  It's pretty much a rehashing of what most people with an interest in vampire legends already know.  Probably of some use to folks just developing an interest in the mythology, as it is pretty easy to follow.  But there's nothing new or groundbreaking in the book 
 I've been wanting to own this set for some time now and I'm sad to say that I was not impressed at all. The DVD quality for all 3 films is good as far as the picture goes but the sound is mediocre. The first Sabata is OK. Adios Sabata may be a little better but The Return of Sabata was just lame. I like Lee Van Cleef so I guess I had high expectations. I didn't care for many of the same characters making repeated appearances as different people. I watched the 3rd installment last night and I was fighting to stay awake! If you can find it cheap, get it just to say you own it. Otherwise avoid 
 When I first skimmed through this book, I thought it would prove to be very helpful.  Unfortunately, although there are some very good suggestions they are overshadowed by poor humor and what many people would consider unacceptable advice.  Although I agree with the author that there are few legitimate reasons for keeping old textbooks (though I am sure, unlike the author, that there are exceptions), I would have to disagree that everyone except football stars and homecoming queens should throw away their high school yearbooks.  Just because it was a "lackluster" experience for her does not mean the rest of us do not genuinely cherish those memories, good and bad.  Not only do I look at mine from time to time, I have actually used it as a reference when trying to remember someone's name, or when a friend has brought up someone from high school, but I can't put a face to the name.  I have read other clutter control books that have had suggestions that are the same or similar to her good ones, but most of those acknowledge keeping mementos, some collections, or other sentimental items, and realize that what fits that description varies from person to person.  I want to live in an organized clutter free home, not a sterilized environment 
 I had this one in high school.  I remember loving it.  After purchasing it, I realized it wasn't as good as I remembered it being.  Granted, it has brought back quite a few memories, but I don't really know if they're really worth remembering.  It's up to you, buy it if you want 
 I cannot recommend this book. It's the same old stuff, an establishment archaeologist clinging to 1930's theories. He closes his mind to paradigm shattering works that render this book obsolete--works like "Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings" by Hapgood; "The Origin Map" by Brophy; and "Giza Powerplant," by Dunn. Instead of addressing the theories of researchers like Z. Sitchin, he unscientifically dismisses them with an unscientific smirk and a laugh, exposing an unwillingness to inspect anything that violates his establishment prejudices 
 I was unable to play in my car CD player, so only choice I got is to listen at home using my home DVD player. 
 To give context to my comments, I have a degree in Middle East History and bought this book, first edition, in 1992.  I began it several times over the years, only to be defeated by the dry prose and ceaseless repetition of unrelated facts.  I finally sat down to read it from start to finish a few months ago.  Now that I've finally finished, I realize that I wish I had never made the attempt.  It is boring, but worse than that, it is deceptive.  All references come for the first edition, hardback.  1. p. 191, Regarding domed buildings, "the transition from the square hall to the round dome posed a problem which was solved by the use of the squinch or pendentive, often with stalacites for decoration."  This quote gives the false impression the Arabs solved the problem of placing a dome on a square hall.  Google "Haggia Sophia" and you will see a dome sitting on a square hall built by Eastern Roman Christians in the 500s.  2.  Constantly discusses communist Arabs in a neutral to positive light (p. 325) but fails to mention the presence of fascist influences in Arab politics, especially the roots of fascism in the Ba'ath Party as a result of Arabism's fascination with 1930s European power politics.  3. p. 359, Regarding the move by the surrounding Arab communities to crush the newly created Israel, Arab "forces moved into the mainly Arab parts of the country."  Hourani then claims fighting broke out because the absence of borders allowed Jews "to occupy the greater part of the country."  This is a deliberate falsification on Hourani's part.  The Arab forces publicly stated aims was the destruction of Israel and the removal of the Jewish community from Palestine.  4.  p. 368, Regarding the resolution of the 1956 Suez Canal Conflict, "Under American and Soviet pressure . . . the three forces withdrew."  Here Hourani implies, falsely, that France, Britain and Israel were affected equally by U.S. and Soviet threats.  In fact, the U.S. Sixth Fleet shielded the three combatant forces from the irrelevant Soviet forces, while acting to pressure the combatants to withdraw.  Even more, Eisenhower's use of economic retaliation against the weak French and British economies did most of the work.  5.  p. 413, In one of the most egregious passages, blames Israel for a war of aggression against the peaceful Egypt, Jordan and Syria in the Six Days War.  I recommend the book, aptly titled, Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East to dispel any misunderstandings fostered by Hourani.  6.  Even when writing honestly, Hourani tends towards dry, and needless, repetition.  By way of example are his nearly indistinguishable passages on Arab poetry on pages 12-14, 49-51, 87, 153, 187, 193-195, 239, 305, 340, 395-397, which could be summarized as "Poetry, both oral and written, is the greatest achievement of Arab culture.  Even today it retains many of the same themes and similar structures to that created in pre-Islamic times."  Except Hourani takes 18 pages over the course of the book to say it.  In conclusion, I can not recommend this book for either the beginner or specialist.  The beginner will be overwhelmed by the flood of unexplained names, dates, facts and figures.  The specialist will constantly find problems with Hourani's accuracy and honesty.  There are too many good books on both Arab and Islamic history for you to waste your time on this one 
 and put it in the cabinet.  If I get 3 more, I'll make them a coaster set.  I have been a John Hiatt fan for years, and this just doesn't measure up to his usual high standards.  I found it to be a pretty boring listen 
 This book was not helpful to me, in fact, it was a little upsetting.  It reminded me, with the dialogue format, of some of the "channeling" books (like Seth or the Course on Miracles), but without even the substance of those books.    Rather, the authors seemed to concentrate on people's childhood troubles, just as a psychoanalyst would, regressing them so as to uncover the beginnings of their psychological problems.    This, to me, is not a useful procedure, but obviously, some people are helped by it.  For those who cannot afford psychotherapy, maybe this little book is a fair substitute.    I personally would need something a little more substantial and down-to-earth.  Diximus 
 Amazon didn't tell any outright lies about this product but they certainly weren't what I expected.  I was expecting something a bit more durable...the first night I tried to sleep in these, they ripped in the back.  The immitation-satin is so thin that it can barely hold itself together.  But I can't give them 1 star because they are just as cute as they look! 
 I think this book has amazing potential- the plot lines are intriguing, and the characters are interesting- but it falls far short of what I anticipated.  Phillips' prose simply does not draw the reader in.  Instead, it is dry and boring, and it becomes incredibly difficult to get through the long, uninteresting passages to find the good parts.  While I think that many readers will enjoy this book because of the powerful plot line, it seemed to me as though the book relied too much on plot and not enough on quality writing 
 I saw the stage production and thought that since it was good the movie would be good also. I was very wrong. The movie is awfu 
 No seriously. I had the highest expectation for this experience. But the story is a mess. It's episodic to the point of distraction. The point of view changes randomly. At one point it's a confession, or a "verbal account". Then it is a written account from a character hardly seen in the first 70% of the story. To say the characters are weakly developed is an insult to...uh...weak people. The language is occasionally witty, but often repetitive and uninteresting. The best part of the novel is the epilogue, which gives details of the Phantom's origins, all of which are FAR more interesting than the contents of the book. I also loved a bit about the real Opera House that came with my Easton Press copy. I loved the stage musical, I loved the old films, I liked the new film...this was extremely disappointing 
 A perfect circle is a great band.  But I may never buy one again after this stupid album.  The first two albums released were wonderful.  This one stunk worse then a fresh turd.  They are surposed to be hard core, destroy the world type of a band.  Not whining little anti war cry babies.  Don't buy it, buy the other two 
 I'd say this book was mediocre and trite. You can judge a book by its cover here- an awful title for an awful read. It is written from a fairly feminist perspective despite the fact that the authors are men. It had a few good points but I could have spent my money in much better ways. A lot of it is stories (Bruce is the fictional 'hero' and Bob is the 'failure' and they keep re-appearing to illustrate the ideas in the book) and the stories are awful. There are  checklists in each chapter ("what to do during the date") and these stories recap what the checklists and ideas say. When one of the stories quoted the checklist verbatim (something like "bruce touched his date on the arm at least once to make physical contact with her blah blah blah") I nearly vomited. At that point I literally threw the book into a fire and made it useful. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED 
 The film was great, but the music, which seemed to fit the film so nicely, just doesn't hold up well on the CD. Save your money for  the DVD or something more interesting than this overly emotional East-West hogwash 
  I haven't seen a movie so one-sided since the Contender. They didn't even try to make good arguments for the pro-gun side. I hate to use the term Liberal Bias but in this case it fits like a glove. The cards in this movie were so stacked against the defense team that by the end of the movie I felt like the gun companies were the underdogs. Pure garbage.   
 There is no such entity as an addictive personalty . Often  the author belittiles ,  mocks   and  discounts what a substance Abuser  says .  Few are truely  in denail as they are seeking help , what denial really means is that the person disagrees with the 12 step counslers version of thier life and problems .  What the non medical term Dry drunk means is a person is  not using   or moderateing with out the help of a 12 step program   The reality is most people quit or moderate on thier own with out the religiious gibberish  of a 12 step program that many    have begun to veiw as a  dangerous cult   Please   seek other advice based  on emprically   reviewed science not  ancetdotal     nonsense dreged  on out dated relgious  dogma .  12 step treatment is nothing more than faith healing and the last time "denial " was used as  evidnece    of something was during the witch craft trails in te 16,00s . It is now 2006 we can do alot better than this.   
 As a 4th year medical student and, formerly a lawyer, I am confident that Mr. Kessler is on a rabbit trail that will never pan out across the spectrum of diseases he suggests. His ideas sound wonderful, but he is missing a fundamental problem. Diagnostic tests inevitably incur false positives and false negatives, and to greatly simplify, as you improve on one, you amplify the other. So, for example, as whatever algorithm you want to concoct becomes better at predicting disease and reducing false negatives, the false positives will go up. People will be treated unnecessarily and that often is harmful. There's a word for that-iatrogenic. This is nothing new and well-known in medical research. Thus, silicon is hardly going to displace MDs. But, it may foster lots of unnecessary and iatrogenic care that will drive the cost of medicine far beyond where it already is today. In addition, it will provide new fodder for the med mal lawyers. Truly, medicine is an art and a science. 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 This is the story of Cassie, who is found wandering helplessly in a cemetery by a young Indian policeman who just arrived in LA. Cassie suffers from amnesia and we don't know what brought her there, until a hollywood megastar recognizes her as his wife.  This is by far the most disappointing of Picoult's books, and I've read almost all of them and am a big fan of hers. Cassie is amnesic, yet she does remember stuff and it is not clear at all in the book how comes she recovers from her amnesia or actually how it happened. The story goes back and forth between the present, the past, the memories, and leaves readers lost in the middle.  I was surprised by other reviewers who were surprised by the ending. Chapter one gives the ending away in my opinion. What is frustrating is that it takes Picoult 350 pages to make her character realise the obvious.  I also found Cassie to be unreliable and unappealing, let alone her husband Alex, a massive egocentric. The story was very confused, mixing hollywood lifestyle with movie sets in Africa, with anthropology, Indian legends, domestic violence, alcoholism, amnesia - it was just too much for one book and the message was confused.   If you want a superb story of domestic violence, read Black & Blue by Anna Quindlen. If you want a good Picoult book, read The Pact or My Sister's Keeper, but definitely not Picture Perfect 
 I started watching this after Fever Pitch, which made me love baseball.  This "documentary" made me hate baseball.  Basically the show plays out like a monologue by Garrison Keillor, set to still photographs.  The history of baseball is not presented factually and dispassionately; instead the viewer gets it crammed down his brain that baseball is a great and noble game played by great and noble men.  This would be like watching a history of World War I and finding that it is narrated by a syrupy-voiced, American-as-the-apple-pie-you're-just-about-to-vomit narrator who starts, in Prairie-Home-Companion-esque manner, drumming it into you that the American soldiers, they were real fine fellers, but Johnny Boche... he was a bad sort.  Maybe Jimmy Stewart could be resuscitated just long enough to provide the American-till-you-puke aw shucks voice-overs and tell us that The American soldiers in the field were as right and true as the weather vane on top of the old barn back home in the yellow corn fields.  The yellow corn fields near the old swimmin' holler, where MaryJane McKlusky took off her red dress with the small white polkadots and danced around naked awhile to the soft sound of the whistle from the faraway train out of Coop's Junction.  
 I was scouting around for a new British crime series to start and heard good things about Peter Robinson. So, when I came across this second in the Inspector Banks series, it seemed like fate was telling me to dive in. However, I and my wife both found it a severely disappointing, utterly unimpressive procedural. I can only surmise the series gets better over subsequent volumes, because this is utterly average stuff.  Inspector Banks has recently relocated form London to sleepy rural Yorkshire and is still getting a feel for the lay of the land (following his first case in Gallows View). One day a retired historian turns up dead in a field near the village of Helmthorpe, leaving Banks with an old-fashioned whodunit. Pretty quickly, the stable of suspects is established: his widow (who inherits a nice legacy), his old friend and publisher, his mystery-writing drinking pal, his local GP and drinking pal, a local entrepreneur developer drinking pal, or the local folk singer he may have had a fling with a decade ago?   Like a latter-day Miss Marple, Banks and his plod underlings go back and forth from house to house, interviewing suspects and trying to tease a semblance of motive and opportunity from their statements. Of course, like the old-fashioned constructions of Christie, we are left with lots of semi-plausible motives and seemingly few opportunities. Banks is convinced the answer lies in a fateful summer ten years ago. Meanwhile, a local teenage girl brags about seeing something the night of the murder, placing herself in danger. Will Banks be able to get to the bottom of things before the killer strikes again?!?!?   It's all pretty bland stuff, and gimmick by which the murderer masks themselves is a bit of a groaner. The clues dovetail nicely, and Robinson's done a capable job of constructing a puzzler, but the story and characters are instantly forgettable. The writing is utterly without style or distinction and the Yorkshire setting never really came alive for me. It seemed a kind of generic green and pastoral land with insular people and cure stone cottages. All in all, very little to recommend here. 
 I have been readung daily meditations/modivational readings for as long as I can remember.  I find this this is probably the most useful in that it covers all aspects of one's life.  I find myself unconsciously nodding my head as I read.  I would highly recommend this book to all of my friends.  It is amazing how much better your day is when you get your brain primed early in the day 
 The absurdly obvious title should be enough to tell you: this book is painful.  From the outset, the characters are all completely stock, thus assuming the reader already knows who they are, thereby releiving the author of developing them significantly.  In keeping with this bland characters, their problems seem to be little more than dopey whinning and fail to be anything more than annoying.  The plot is VERY predictable and I found I was just waiting for the expected outcomes to run their course: Devlin's self-absorbtion does him in, Max's inner goodness helps him adapt to the situation, Zeffy and Tia are set up to become big stars after overcoming self-doubt, the mother becomes more confident with the help of a new lover and the teenage daughter meanders through standard teenager problems before spontaniously deciding to grow up at the end.  Don't feel like I've blown the ending- its obvious from the get go.  I admit this is the only De Lint novel I've ever read, but I don't feel like reading another 
 This machine has a couple of neat sounds but the volume is very low and even when you turn it all the way to maximum it is not loud machine - this is a noise machine! The machine is also very flimsy and doesn't make me feel confident that this is a good quality machine. I ended up returning it and go back on the market for a good noise machine (Homedics used to have a good one, but it's no long available - it has been replaced with this new one definitely not as good) 
 The late Dr. Kelly is one of my all time favorite authors in the field of Church History (_Dictionary of Popes_, _Golden Mouth_, _Jerome_), but this foray into Biblical Studies, is quite disappointing.  Dr. Kelly merely retreads tired interpretations of what are three of the most overlooked but most interesting of the New Testament epistles.  The inclusion of 1 Peter with 2 Peter & Jude is highly dubious as well.  For really interesting writing on Jude & 2 Peter, I would suggest E. Earle Ellis' or Richard Bauckham's work.  There are many excellent commentaries on 1 Peter, too many to list.  I guess even brilliant authors have their off days 
 Fong Sai Yuk 2 is my favorite Jet Li movie bar none. I'd give it 6 stars out of 5. Why do I enjoy it so much? Because in addition to a lot of wonderful over the top martial arts you get a tremendous amount of hilarity and top shelf comedic acting from both Jet Li and Josephine Siao, who plays his mother. Sadly, the english dubbing of this version of the movie re-titled apparently at random by Disney as "The Legend 2" eliminates Li and Siao's priceless performances. What you get instead is 10th rate otherwise-unemployed American actors stumbling their way through a lot of generic, sanitized dialogue in the footage which remains after much of the comedy has been edited out. That's right, actual footage has been edited out of this version. Sheesh. Do yourself a huge favor and avoid this version of the movie. Look for the original language, subtitled, uncut version entitled "Fong Sai Yuk 2" which is available from various online sources 
 I found this book sophomoric and silly.  Not up to par.  
 With the elections approaching there are going to be a lot of changes in the House, Senate and among the nation's governors. Printing this almanac before the results of the election effectively makes a large portion of this book worthless.  
 While some consequences for the backtalk make sense like taking away a priviledge or cancelling a special outing, there are some that seem extremely selfish on the parent's part and can affect more than just your child. According to this author, if your child backtalks right before he is to perform a solo in a school band concert you should discipline him by refusing to take him to the concert. You should call up all the relatives that were going to attend the concert and tell them not to come. As for the entire band and the band director that were counting on that solo as part of the performance, you should tell them that it's not your fault he wasn't there, but your child's for backtalking. In what universe is it acceptable to ruin the entire performance for a band (often consisting of a dozen to a hundred kids) and embarrassing a band director because you were unwilling to think of a less selfish punishment? According to his book, he says you as a parent shouldn't even care how it affects the rest of the world! They just have to deal with it! That seems as immature and rude as the backtalk he says you should eliminate 
 I wanted a cheap edition to mark up with notes- but I had no idea that this publisher would be so careless as not to proofread or quality check the work.  There were typos- sometimes several to a page, such as "Foik" or "Fdk" for "Folk", periods randomly placed in the middle of sentences, lines that would shift up a fraction of a line (as if they were superscripted but the font size remained the same).  It was a headache to read.  On top of this, Pages 443/444 and 453/454 (which are the same sheet of paper) were torn clear across the bottom half, yet sewn into the book as is- so I can't even read those pages!)  I had already been reading and note taking up to this point so I don't think I could return it now, even though its obvious on inspection this damage happened in the assembly of the book 
 I waited for months only to find out my order was not available.  Would have loved to have received it 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 This text is an easy read, and you will understand the reactions that are given in the text examples. So why the low rating? Organic chemistry is all about "prediction". And when it comes to teaching you how to predict the outcomes of reactions you've never seen before, it is lacking! You can study this text two hours a day, every day, and unless you have an uncanny ability to understand chemistry (I don't)--you will still not have this most fundamental skill you need to succeed.  Try "Organic Chemistry as a Second Language" and "Organic Chemistry II as a Second Language".  They will have you predicting and understanding Orgo in no time!! This course isn't hard at all- once someone explains it to you properly. David Klein (the author of those two books) does that beautifully 
 I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read.  The whole plot is just plain ridiculous.  Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime.  When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years.  Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is?  Avoid this one 
 To borrow a riff from PJ, if this is literature, I'd hate to see what drivel looks like... I've always enjoyed PJ's hilarious rants as he skewered stupidity and political correctness, while keeping his political beliefs (for the most part) under the hood, where they rightly belonged.  Sadly, in this case, the dual curse of flat humor laced with bitterness and the burden of a lost political cause (the defense of Dubya) combine to transform this from "must buy" to "pick it up when you please because it will languish on the library shelves".  I had to force myself to finish this, and will say that the final postscript was the best part of the whole. 
 (With the possible exception of Klemperer's Fidelio.)  I am deeply comforted to see from other reviews that others are finally getting the message. As Mr Clinton's campaign team would say, "It's the singing, stupid". Do *not* be mislead by the starry names, this thing barks and yowls like New Year's Eve in the cats-and-dogs home.  Do not pass Go, do not waste $35, go directly to Josef Krips on Decca Legends for three discs of perfect joy 
 The book is good. The software is plain horrible. It sounds a strange combination but how you could qualify a memory hog which eventually shuts down my pretty good home computer with 2 GB of memory, with horrible boot time, and random crashes or hangs and features I would not care for in ages, like ability to keep my media on INet 
 It had some moments, but overall, if i had it to do over again, i wouldn' 
 As is becoming unfortunately common today, this text has not been seriously edited. In many places it either lacks proper punctuation or the punctuation is improperly employed. The text is sometimes missing conjunctional words, and numerous sentence fragments occur. The book sometimes reads as if the manuscript was in point form; at others, it is almost like a rushed translation into English from some other language. Although this is the fault of the editor, it is an irony that the author sprinkles (sics) liberally throughout his book, where these are intended as quibbling corrections to the spelling or technical inaccuracies of the autobiographies and field reports of the soldiers involved in the action the author is describing.    Moreover, several-page introductions/historical overviews (of such mundane topics as the 'Second World War,' but also of some of the geographical locations discussed in the text) preoccupy the first pages of several chapters; these have been included as backgrounders, but serve only to distract, as they are either unnecessary given the expected audience, or largely irrelevant to the book's thrust. Some readers will inevitably skip over them on sight, as I found myself doing.    The endnotes in the book's first half are largely technical data on the weapons mentioned in the text; this is another curious addition considering the (assumed!) intended audience, who likely know this information from memory. The book's structure therefore anticipates an informed (although not specialist) audience, but the introductory narrative of a few chapters and most of the notes assume a general readership. (On the other hand, the author does not explain the lion's share of the requisite military jargon and acronyms; he assumes they will be understood by the reader).    The operational descriptions would have benefited from additional maps for contextualization (only one map is given of Operation JUBILLE, when the book concentrates on the actions of 4 Commando on the far right flank; a map of the RAF's flight paths on the right flank seems to have taken precedence over the movements of the Commando. (?))    Ironically, the end of the book, which describes events after the withdrawal of 4 Commando from the beaches of Dieppe (chapters entitled "Homecoming" and the "Aftermath"), are much more skillfully and thoughtfully written without unruly harping on the results of Dieppe proper, and it is these entries that make the overall effort worthwhile.    The book ends up reading like a narrative, and not a scholarly commentary; this will make it more attractive to the general readership, and is perhaps the more fitting introduction to this little-known subject. Ultimately however (regardless of the format!), the context and intended audience of the work was never definitively solidified, so the book cannot decide whether to comment technically (which it does occasionally, but not very well), or try to characterize the figures that are important to the operation. Sadly, it makes a partial attempt to do both, but fails to do either. It is however a quick read, and I wasn't put off enough to give up on it (if you don't mind the editing, you'll find it fun).    The subject of 4 Commando's actions in Operation JUBILEE merits serious treatment, within the larger context of the result of the Dieppe raid. Two stars given for the importance of the topic; no more is fair, given the organizational quality 
 This guide does not come close to comparing with Lonely Planet.  It is poorly written and gives little or no information about museums and city sites other than their address and hours of operation.  The map is also poorly done and it is difficult to use in locating restaurants and museums.  Buenos Aires is an amazing city so I suggest buying a worthy guide book, not this one 
 This handsome volume badly disappointed me. I think the proper rating for the book is about one and a half stars, but I gave it two out of generosity.   If you don't have a printer and are looking to buy one, it gives a pretty good round-up of the choices, technologies, and papers. The problem with this kind of thing, of course, is that it is necessarily dated--so it can't really serve as a buyer's guide.  If you already have a printer--I have an Epson 4800--and a source of digital images, you won't find much information here about how to make great prints. The only section on the actual print making process shows the dialogs for one printer, probably the author's. Totally unhelpful unless you have that printer (and you've probably already figured out how those dialogs work if you have that printer).  The section on RIP software is way overview, and doesn't provide any decent guidance on how to proceed with it.  I'm not given to writing negative reviews, and I don't often return books (as I am with this one), but in the face of all the positive feedback for this book I feel compelled to provide my opinion. As I said, if you are looking to buy a printer, this might help you understand the basic technology issues (although the models have changed since the book was written). Otherwise, the only use I see for it is as a "gee whiz" coffee table book for would-be digital printers rather than a serious reference manual 
 The normal elements of an Anita Blake novel (supernatural detective work, exciting action, and Anita's strong will) are reduced and pushed aside in favor of gratuitous sex scenes.  There's nothing wrong with a little romance, especially if it advances the plot.  However, these repeditive scenes are about as romantic and subtle as a sledgehammer.  They don't contribute to the plot, but instead interrupt it.    The excuse is that Anita has been infected by the ardour, a supernatural hunger for sexual energy.  Supposedly she got it from Jean Claude, even though it was never mentioned in the previous nine books.  It's a very flimsy plot device.   More annoying is the change in Anita.  Always before, she fought stubbornly to maintain her morals against all influcences.  However, she makes no attempt to resist the ardour.    The book is so different in focus, flow, writing style, phrasing, and word choices that I suspect it was partially or entirely ghost written.    I greatly enjoyed all the Anita Blake novels prior to this one.  I recommend reading those.    I advise against reading this one 
 Makes many accurate observations about boy behavior and its origins,however,the book leans a little too much toward "feminization" of boys in preventing behavioral problems.This may be the politically-correct way to help boys,but not the productive way or the ethical way 
 OK, this obscure slasher seems promising... good premise, attractive and interesting cast with a few known names, decent budget and effects, a sense of humour and witty, bitchy dialogue. I mean, you'd think a horror flick about competing for cheerleader queen would be a can't miss, no? So where did Cheerleader Camp go astray? In two major areas... pacing and body count. Nothing ever really happens until the ending, and after all the build up, most of the murders occur offscreen! So, basically, there's no payoff. What a waste of a great set-up an an eager, game cast. Don't buy, rent 
 Cleopatra Records produces a wide variety of compilations. Some quite good (tribute to pink floyd and gong's YOU remixed) and others awful. This package falls into the awful category. A nicely done package with little inside. Over 50 bands contribute to this. Biggest names are Bauhaus (In the Flat Field), Leg. Pink Dots, Delerium, Fields of Nephilim, Boyd Rice, etc. If you are a true collector of these folks and expect to get something new or really rare, forget it. Most of it is available. The rest of the multitude of bands sound like 80 throwbacks. Nothing really innovative or original. Problem with gothic has always been it's pretentiousness. Cleopatra has already released a variety of dull gothic compilations, why do this again? I am sure there is something in here for everyone, but not everyone will love all of this material. Borrow it from a friend, not worth the price in my opinion.   
 Golly! I didn't find out until the other day that BSB came out with a new CD last summer. It's called "Never Gone" and I didn't even know BSB was trying to make a comeback! No one tells me anything! Anyway, I listened to at least 2 songs on the CD and then I couldn't take it anymore. BSB will only be known as one of the many corny, untalented boy groups in American music history. Believe that! 
 I read this as a thirteen year old boy and enjoyed it.  A re-read twenty years later gave me a different perspective.  MacLeans dialogue between his characters is comic book variety at best. There are also a few glaring errors that I am surprised that his editor did not pick up on, two of note: Shaffer (supposedly from Montana) is credited with a Mid-West accent?? Montana is far west not 'mid' west.  Secondly, Nazi helicopters?  This is just plain sloppy.  MacLean should have known much better.  This one belongs on the bookshelf of a teenage boy.  For a better read of MacLeans better works I reccomend; HMS Ulysess and Bear Island.  The characters are far more credible and provide a better story by far.  A poor effort by Mr MacLean 
 The concept of this book intrigued me: analysis of the first really postmodern president America had, a man who was known for scanning the polls before he had an opinion on any issue, and a candidate whose success was made possible by computer analysis of voter opinion. However, the work itself is quite tedious. There is not enough analysis of characters, and too many scenes explaining the political process. There is too much emphasis on the development of a plot that's tangential to the study of tehse characters, and there is not enough room given to them so that, in breathing, they might exhale what we can then diagnose. I didn't understand why so much emphasis was placed on the narrator, either, since his role was not central. While I read this book without political bias, I was not blown away by its quality as a read or a political novel, but the insight into a certain president's character, and how that made him a success, was intriguing. Not sure if I'd recommend it to anyone except historians at this point 
 Not to put too fine a point on it but this book is DRY - almost like a text book.  There is very little action and/or suspense brought forth about involvement in the Angola operation and what could have been was quickly blunted with operational and bureaucratic detail.  And that's how the book drags on, with excruciating detail. In one part, Mr. Stockwell describes what he did to finally get a desk to work from at Langley by sitting in the hall in everyone's way and stacking his papers up beside him.  What took him pages to describe should've been done in a simple paragraph.  To be fair, the book is written from the viewpoint of an intelligence staffer not a cloak and dagger operative. Yes, there might be some interest in how inefficient the CIA was operating back in the mid-1970s but that's true for most large government organizations. He also describes some of the "political" machinations between officials within the CIA.  Again, mildly interesting but nothing notable. Some of the descriptions of dialog and reactions of persons seems contrived, almost as if he (or some ghost writer) added these things for effect. It almost "reads" like a fiction novel in that respect. Rather than writing a solid, crisp account with thoughtful and concise opinions about CIA policy and inner workings the book devolves often times into monotonous detail. However, in the latter chapters the account does get more interesting as he discusses "plausible deniability" and the deception of the CIA to "hide" their involvement. One of the more interesting parts is the organizational background and resources needed to run an operation of this type including the shipping of weapons and ammo, the propaganda strategy, the political workings thru committees, the State Department and the President to gain support, etc.  The book does makes one wonder what other rebellions or conflicts the CIA was involved in over the last 30-40 years and is an eye opener about our nations espionage policies. On this level, the book succeeds.  But, in the end the book was almost a grind to finish.  I'd only recommend this one for the hard core 'spook' fan 
 I got some sea monkeys and was really excited to see them hatch and grow. They did grow and develop and they grew pretty big but they were kind of boring to watch. I wasn't really satisfied though. I knew and did take care of them as much as I could but the tank got really nasty and it was too gross and dirty to look at. I wasn't very satisfied and didn't get what I expected 
 Troy Taylor is without doubt an inept writer.  He rambles constantly about unimportant minute details while letting big concepts pass by.  His depiction of the witch varies from page to page.  At times she is nice, and at others she is mean.  However, during reading, the reader gets the impression that Kate is great fun to have around.  At one point, he goes into a complete tangent about Andrew Jackson that is completely unneeded in the story, and this complete history of Jackson was not needed.  Also, this book has little merit as a historical work due to the authors unending bias agains debunkers.  Many of the stories that he presents are postulations on "what people must have thought," and he makes his rather negative opinions of debunkers quite well known.  I will admitt that he did do a good job of presenting the basic parts of the Bell Witch story, but beyond that, he srewed this book up.  Also, for the love of God, he needs to learn to have someone besides a trained chimp to proof read his work.  These are mistakes that a fourth grader could have picked up on.  
 I wonder if Ms. Wise realy cooked and tried out all these recipes? The garbonzo bean preparation recipe at the times and temperatures specified, left the beans to hard and inedible. The Bolognese sauce ,cooked at medium heat, left my new Fagor pressure cooker with a horrible scorch that took me two hours to scour out.(Many of the temperature setting look way too high for pressure cooking) She states that only baby Artichokes can be cooked in a pressure cooker...not true.etc. etc For a better, more reliable, pressure cooker cook book try "Pressure Cookers for Dummys 
 I don't see how you can isolate "The Grand Inquisitor" chapter from the novel in which it is situated, The Brothers Karamazov.  I think that knowing who is telling the story, who he is telling the story too, what the story means to each of these people, and what the consequences of what the Grand Inquisitor have to say, are ALL important; important because it is a great novel and important in understanding the grand inquisitor!!!!!!!  My suggestion: Buy The Brothers Karamazov instead of this.  It's excellent 
 After waiting for 1 month to get this toy I cannot tell you HOW disappointed my 7 year old daughter was when she got it. Absolutely this thing is a WASTE of money!  It is poorly designed and there is no way you can trace from it. The image is impossible to see with any amount of detail.  DO NOT BUY THIS TOY! I would give it zero stars if I could 
 It Could Happen to You was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others. The movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day.   The acting is surprisingly (!) below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is not bad at all.   Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful! Bridget Fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland. Rosie Perez's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on. As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong.  Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all. Finally, somebody shoot the "Narrator," PLEASE! Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here. If Nicolas Cage is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels and/or The Family Man. 
 The Gospels do make it clear that Jesus was divine:  Specifically in John "In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and the Word became flesh".  As well, when Jesus got up on the temple steps and points to himself and says "Before Abraham was 'I am' (Yhwh--identifies himeself with the four letter name of God).  Not surprisingly, this is when the Jews go for the stones.  Rubenstein's book tries to wishfully explain away the "divine" aspect of Christ but, as with the Arians before him, the attempt will most likely fail 
 This is my first (and definantly last) IGOS published book. It is astonishingly badly written and the author states in the introduction that it's source is from "channeled" material to boot. The fake leather cover has the cheap appearance of a junior high school annual. It's hard for this reviewer to understand what makes this poor tome "ancient" or "dark", or for that point "magick 
 Lucky for us, Siri Hustvedt went on to write greater things, and we can expect even more of her as she hones her craft.  "The Enchantment of Lily Dahl," he second novel, will disappoint those readers who absolutlely loved her novel "What I Loved," an emotionally gripping, sophisticatedly plotted and lyrical novel about the intersections of love, art and life in 1980s and 1990s New York City.  I found nothing really enchanting or enchanted about Hustvedt's protaganist in this one, a blond buxom waitress withering as in smalltown Minnesota but hoping for a career as an actress.  The story might have been about a young woman discovering something within herself and her surroundings, but instead, the reader gets a murder mystery with a psycho, as well as a handful of caricatured and unbelievable characters who all seem to love Lily Dahl but never seem to get her.  Don't judge Hustvedt by this one 
 Price's rant against white racism (brought on by Kenneth Hagin, Jr.'s silly comments on "mixed marriages") has revealed his own bigotry.  While watching his weekly TV program, I saw how Price lambasted the white members of his church as guilty collaborators of America's treatment of blacks.  This is the same thing as blaming Japanese-Americans for the attack on Pearl Harbor. If the white members of Price's church were bigots, then why were they attending in the first place?  The following week's broadcast showed Price chastising his black attendees for harassing white attenders as they left services the week prior!  Price continued his tantrums for many weeks--which now constitutes this book.  This whole episode demonstrates how Hagin and Price are more alike than different.  Ignore the book as you should these two undisciplined, self-righteous teachers 
 I can't really smell, but everyone who has been around me as said it smelled terrible. Smells like ammonia is the answer i usually got. i then tried putting it on, then putting on some of my good colonge and it didnt help any. Only one girl thought it smelled nice... she thought it smelled like vanilla. All others... list of about 20+ said it smelled bad. I am going to return it for my money back. You can give it a try... 1/20 are the odds i got, not good enough for me to spend $40 on 
 I really wanted to like this book and the beginning started out great.  A shocking murder is committed in the town of Newpointe, then another.  Meanwhile, fireman Mark Branning has moved out and is separated from his wife Allie.  There is a serial killer targeting the wives of firemen and Allie and Mark must fight through their struggles for the sake of their marriage.  I wanted to like this book because it is a Christian novel with a good purpose.  Ninety percent of the books I've read have been secular but I'm starting to read more Christian novels.  But to me, this book fails for three reasons:  the marriage conflict between Mark and Allie isn't believable, the serial killer plot collapses under its own weight, and the spiritual message is confusing and disappointing.		  Mark and Allie's marriage is suffering because she thinks he had an affair and he hasn't convinced her otherwise.  Seeing your husband hugging another woman is not proof of adultery, but it is grounds for suspicion.  Yet, Allie assumes Mark is cheating on her because she witnessed him hugging another woman.  It seems to me the truth would be discovered in the resulting fight.  Instead, Mark and Allie separate and Allie sees no hope for her marriage because of that hug and what she assumes was an affair.		  Blackstock does a poor job of framing the conflict between Mark and Allie.  Throughout the book, references are made to Allie believing Mark had an affair with Issie.  Allie refers to Mark's act as "adultery" and recalls him "lying" his way out of it after Allie caught him hugging Issie.  Their marriage is struggling, but Blackstock should have given more reasons why Allie assumed adultery other than a hug because throughout the book, Mark says he didn't have an affair and Allie chalks it up to one of his lies.  Later in the novel, Blackstock gives more reason for their conflict but by then its too late.  The serial killer story is poorly done, and it also seems everybody knows everybody in this book.  When they book a suspect at the end, it seems ridiculous.  The police work feels like it was written by an amateur.  One line in the novel, "As much as the evidence pointed to XXX, Stan didn't want to believe it."  In my opinion, the evidence didn't point to that person and Stan, the detective, seems foolish for believing it.  There isn't any rhythm or flow to the police work or the serial killer in the story.  There is no sense of setting in the book.  There are too many characters that no each other yet little context in how they know each other.  Finally, this book talks about God and prayer and being "saved" throughout the book, and that's great.  With a serial killer on the loose, a lot of bad things are happening and the characters react to this in a bad way.    At one point, a conversation goes like this:  "How can the murder be part of God's plan?"  "Maybe it isn't"  "That would mean God isn't in control."  "He is in control, but he allows some things to happen."  Then at another point, Mark says to Allie, "I'm going to be fine, it's time to trust the Lord.  He's taken care of us so far."  Then Allie says:  "But I don't know what his plan is.  I don't know how he wants this to end.  I don't know what he wants to teach us."  At other points in the book, characters say that God has a plan and maybe the serial killer is part of God's plan and that through God's plan, all things can be used for good.  This line of logic is infuriating.  Bad things happen to everyone, including God's people.  God doesn't "allow" a serial killer to shoot and burn your wife.  That's a horrible message to send to a non-Christian who may have lost someone in a car wreck.  Telling them it was part of God's plan is the quickest way to turn someone from God.  God is obviously there for people when something bad happens to help them through it and to find the good in it and God can even keep bad things from happening to Christians.  But like above, where Allie was afraid because she thought God might have chosen to have her killed to teach a lesson, God doesn't willfully kill people.  It comes down to the simple fact that all people, including serial killers and Christians, have choices to make and have free will.  I'm surprised I wrote so much on an 8 year old book but I wanted it to be a good book.  
 This book was a silly mess.  Karp's pop ethnopediatric approach, which likens toddler development to the evolutionary development of humans, was silly at best and scientifically shoddy at worst.  In addition to the problems with his guiding analogy, his notion of "speaking toddlerese" and thus supposedly showing our young children that we understand their feelings is ridiculous.  Maybe it's just my kid, but I don't think many young children are that in touch with the feelings which we are supposed to mirror back to them.  In addition, my child doesn't care if I understand her or not if (as another reviewer remarked) the answer is still no.  I think understanding child development is very important in helping parents to contextualize and deal with various behaviors, but this book is a failure in both of these respects.  
 This book is not at all what I was expecting.The websites and ideas are  very well known and some such as etoys do not even exsist anymore!It is very outdated and I think anyone who is at all familiar with the web knows about such sites as ivillage.It also gives you lists of very well known beauty,parenting and magazine sites.If you are looking for a book that will give you fresh ideas and fresh little known innovative sites this is not the book for you.Stick with a search engine and save yourself the money.You might even find better sites using a search engine!If you are very new to the web and need a very basic guidebook then this is for you.It is a great starting point.I am actually going to give this book to my Mother in law who has never surfed the web.That is about all it is useful for 
 Too bad there isn't a 0 star rating. This was simply awful.  I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years - waded though a lot of her semi-readable stuff - waiting for another decent installment.  But I give up.  No more Kaye Scarpetta for me.  This book cured me - for good 
 It may be surprising to know that this is one of the cases in which the movie is a lot better than the book. This book is literary garbage, an over-written mess with a terrible story.  The main problem has to do with just how ridiculous and convuluted it is. If you've seen the musical movie, prepare for a story that is not only different but of poor construction. This is likely from its serialized roots. The convolution would be fine if the work was not written in a ridiculous amount of detail that muddles the already fuzzy story.  People also complain that the book is anti-semitic. A top criminal is referred to as a Jew. That claim is ridiculous. If you know a lot of crime fiction, you'd probably know that there are a lot of Jewish criminals and they usually are identified by that detail.  I adore the film, which is classic and has great music. Stay far away from this book, which IMO is bad 
 This book only tells you that radiant heat is in the floor. Very basi 
 In the original film the seven were played by seven top-notch actors..even Brad Dexter,the most colorless of the original seven was head and shoulders above this new bunch...Oh,yeah,Yul Brynner replays his role as the leader,but the other two surviving members from the original film are played by new,and inferior actors.."Vin"the role that helpled make actor Steve McQueen's reputation,is taken over by Robert Fuller,the scout on the old"Wagon Train" teevee show..While McQueen started out on teevee himself(In "Wanted-Dead or Alive"),he had that "something" which Fuller lacks.."Chico"the half-breed mexican,who also survived the first film's shoot-out was played in that film by Horst Buchholtz..in this film the charismatic Buchholtz has been replaced by the colorless Julian Mateos..Claude Akins and Warren Oates try to fill out roles played better by James Coburn and Charles Bronson...Another thing that first film had going for it was Eli Wallach as the bad guy.. ,the bad guy in this film is about as menacing as a housefly,which tends to make the whole film seem a total waste of time.. 
 This book is packaged as light and fun, but it's a long, slow read.  It's not cohesive -- it reads like several short stories strung together.  The book is supposed to be a romance, but the weakest relationship by far is between Lisa and Strauss, who won't even let him call her by his first name.  When the story revolves around her family, it gets funny and readable and moves along fairly quickly.  When it bogs down in her relationship with her boss, it's just boring.  The ending felt abrupt and forced and was very disappointing.  I know it's supposed to be a happily-ever-after for Lisa, but I just felt sorry for her.  
 Aside from some of the special effects, this is the worst movie I have ever seen.  The story is basically an updated version of Pinnochio and it left me feeling cheated. I kept watching it becaue I expected so much more but it never, and I do mean never, delivered. I believe that I was supposed to feel pained over what the human race suffers but I just felt sad that I spent so much time with this movie 
 This material is a very short {67 pages} from a speech given at the poetry center NY, NY ..back in 1970. It is based on classic 'anarcho-syndicalist' thought, which the author makes no bones about. The likes of Von Humbolt and Rousseau are quoted {or misquoted} from which the author derives his own extrapolations. Unfortunately there are no prescriptions for how this 'perfect' society is to emerge. It is difficult to rate. Since it lacks a logical conclusion I have given it two stars, though it is a well written agitprop. 
 the script is garbage...as if they made it up as they were going along ( the amount of production goofs prove it).....even a golf ball knows you can stop a train by killing the power to the third rail...the subway chase scene ?...catching a train on a motorcycle ?...the two trains ramming at high speed ? ugh hello !!!this movie was a complete waste of time and to be avoided at all costs......if your into trains by any means, dig into the archives and discover "the taking of pelham one two three 
 As someone who was absolutely blown away by 'Waiting' I anticipated loving this as well. I did read a pre-publication proof that I found used in a local bookstore, so maybe there were some big changes between the proof and the finished product, but I was very disappointed in this story. As a few other reviewers have pointed out, the characters are totally one-dimensional, and Jian, the narrator, is relatively uninteresting and one doesn't really care what becomes of him. Plus, while what happened to Professor Yang after the Revolution was horrible, i'm sure it happpened to many, many intellectuals, so it wasn't that out of the ordinary. Finally, and I don't know if this was in the final novel or not, there is a note from the author at the end thanking someone for 'seeing the potential for this when she first read it in 1988.' So, my fear is that this is one of those first novels that was rejected, and suddenly, when a writer has success (as with 'Waiting') their earlier work magically is worthy of publication.   Overall, not a great novel, but an interesting view of pre-Tiannammen Square China, and Ha Jin is a good writer, and 'Waiting' was SO good that this wouldn't stop me from reading something else by him, but i'd pass on this one if I were you.. 
 This movie has everything-- predictable plot, wooden acting, monsters, bad guys, selfless heroes, villainous professors, pretty heroines, bombs, guns and explosions (although my husband noted that there wasn't much nudity or sex.) We had a great time making fun of it, guessing what was going to happen next (which wasn't hard; we were right every time) and laughing at the incredibly bad dialogue. This would be a good movie to watch on Halloween night with the kids who are too old for trick or treating. Turn off the lights, turn on the movie and let 'er rip 
 Nothing new or the slightest bit insightful can be found within these pages. Anyone who's read a decent book or two about Led Zeppelin (not counting the terrible Hammer of the Gods or Richard Cole's travesty) already knows everything supposedly "revealed" here. There's a lot left out, and Fyfe seems to attribute every good idea the band had to drugs. He keeps calling them "hippies," and has the nerve to claim that they never went on to release an album on par with the fourth. Excuse me?  He also mentions the ridiculous "deal with the devil" rubbish far too many times, giving the '70s media hacks more attention than they deserve and actually claiming that Zeppelin cared about what critics thought, designing their fourth album around media "respectability." He has the audacity to try defending the press's treatment of the band during the '70s, and says mean things like how Jimmy "ate his words" when he agreed to play with Plant again. This kind of unwarranted criticism can be found throughout the book.  One gets the idea that Fyfe was never much of a Zeppelin fan, but read a few books and stole their best bits for this assignment. His wording's often identical to that in other works. His grammar's not very good; it's full of run-on sentences and annoying word repetition.  There's so much good information left out from dozens of great interviews over the years, regarding the making of the fourth album alone (which is what this book's supposedly about, although you get a condensed bio of nearly everyone mentioned on the fringes of the band, which is unnecessary and tedious), that the book is unacceptably incomplete.  There's also a lot of erroneous information. For instance, Fyfe quotes John Paul Jones as stating that "Going to California" was recorded outside in the garden, and that a plane can be heard flying over. He's actually talking about "Black Country Woman," which is on an entirely different album! Fyfe quotes "In the Evening" by claiming that Robert sings "I'm in pain" (no, he doesn't) and says that hip-hop as we know it wouldn't exist without the Beastie Boys ripping off Bonzo (very wrong).  He also contradicts himself constantly -- stating, for instance, that Page and Plant arrived at Headley Grange with "Battle of Evermore" worked out, but then later telling the story we already know: Page picked up Jones' mandolin while staying at Grange and began writing the song based on his experiments with the instrument.  The book's full of things like this. Save your money. 
 I have to wonder if the previous reviewers are writing about this particular book.  There are no "rhymes" and the letters of the alphabet do not run down the page.  I was quite disappointed when I received this book, since it was not what I expected.  The author could have invented more clever phrases than "Xylophone for Xmas" and "Nine in their nests".    I was not impressed 
 While the story line was tolerable and interesting at times, the preachiness of 'educating the reader' about the favorite 'special interest' of the author really comes across to clumsily that it detracts from the overall flow of the book (every few pages there seems to be a jab here and there thrown in to meet some sort of a PSA quota.)  The story line is not as good as Toxin, but this title is slightly less offensive in the constant regurgitation of the 'healthcare system= evil' message than it is in Toxin 
 While the silicon used in the construction of the sleeve is very nice (feels grippy but not sticky if you know what I mean), some of the features are just wrong.  For instance, the opening for the hold switch on top was apparently cut wrong and does not line up with the switch at all - requiring you to have to push the cover around so you can flip the hold on or off.  Also, for whatever reason, the edge of the sleeve is right at the headphone jack which causes it to be somewhat difficult to keep some headphones seated during use (the sleeve can work its way in and pop the jack out).   The armband is satisfactory at best - it's just a standard, no frills, velcro armband 
 Oh, dear. Le Carre is, or was earlier in his career, a brilliant writer.   I have read and reread a number of Le Carre books lately and what is clear to me is that the quality of his novels has deteriorated over the years, as one might expect, I suppose. Single and Single reads like something written to fill out a publishing contract for a certain number of books.  The plots meanders and is hard to follow. You may think that this is par for the course in the novels of Le Carre, but all I can say is that his better works like Spy Who Came In and Honourable Schoolboy have elements of this trickiness, but it is not overdone.  There is a certain tendency in modern English novelists--I'm thinking of people like Martin Amis--to give the reader a hard time, and in his later books Le Carre seems to be increasingly of the school of letting the reader try to figure out on his own what is going on in the book. My interpretation is that this is due to lazy writing, and the author losing sight of the reader. Others may disagree.  In earlier novels Le Carre leaned a great deal on what appeared to be inside knowledge of the espioniage business. Well, he had me convinced, anyway. Once he gets away from that territory, it seems to me that he is much more inauthentic.  My guess is that the character of Tiger Single is somewhat based on Le Carre's own father, who was something of a jet-set conman.  The book has plently of brilliantly witty  dialog, very much a Le Carre specialty, and passages of superb descriptive writing, so all is not lost, but I would only recommend it for the diehard Le Carre fan who has read everything else and has a lot of time on his/her hands 
 I have not read this book.  But I clicked on the link for information about the author, and was taken to his publisher's website.  It was filled with Mr. Capt's books, and many others on (pro) Identity movement, British Israelism, the superiority of the white race, disbelief in a literal hell, etc.  I am caucasion, and I strongly disagree with these cult beliefs, so I would not consider reading books by Mr. Capt other than to see what a twisted version of a topic from the Bible said.  Evangelicals--beware!  Make sure you know what you are getting 
 This movie is so bad. It is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems. The only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character, a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities. The movie tries hard to invent new "teen speak" with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character, Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end, she's like Ella May Clampet going after Jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out. 
 I used to think Ty made good toys...but I was wrong on this one! The "fur" is really a weird material (not plush!) that has an awful "tacky" feel to it that makes it creepy to touch and makes the toy look worn out and old already. But even worse is that all of Blue's spots are actually painted on! You can feel where the paint is dried and it is truly gross. I wouldn't recommend this toy, especially not to give to a child. I have yet to decide if I should throw it into the wash or throw it away altogether! Yuck 
 I recently saw this book on the bargain bin.  This book was pure garbage, by two arrogant 20-somethings in clown suits.  Basically they are saying valuations don't matter.  Since they wrote the book, it has been prooven that their philosophy, approached over the long term, produces some great damaging losses.  The book may be useful during the next bubble, which if history serves, will occur well after these clowns pass on to the big three-ring circus in the sky.  To the dungeon with these two knaves 
 Take advice from somebody who is able to easily win over others easily.  The advice and beliefs shown in this book are just wrong.  If you want to do really well.  Do what others that are doing well are doing.  Adopt the beliefs, mannerisms, attitude,  techniques, ideas  of who you wish to be like  and you'll get the same results.  in other words.  Don't copy John Gray.  
 I agree with "A Reader"  I bought this book thinking I could use it to get on top of levels, get infinite ammo, etc.  What I got was some pretty useless guides for Halo 1 and 2, plus a bunch of what felt like ads.  If you're a die-hard Halo fan, this book might be worth buying, but otherwise I would advise steering clear of it 
 The friends of and people know to Chicago Lt. Jacqueline "Jack" Daniels are being targeted for torture and murder by someone connected by the convicted "Gingerman" serial killer.    I really did enjoy Konrath's first two books.  But this one left me with a hangover.  I love the characters of Jack and her partner Herb, and the humor in the writing.  I did get tired of constant description of every item of clothing Jack was wearing and the label attached thereto.  I don't even mind dark and gruesome as long as there's a real purpose to it.  But this felt, to me, as though the author couldn't think of an original plot so he merely picked up on a theme and had a joyous time describing as many ways possible that one human being can torture themselves or another.  It is a quick read, it does have humor, it is absolutely not for those who don't like graphic violence.  I think it's time for me to go on the wagon where Konrath is concerned 
 I had to use this book for a class at National University.  What a coincidence it was written by a professor at NU! ... The book is biased and doesn't go in depth into anything.  Most of us in my class figured we had to buy this book to line Ryan's pockets, none  of us really cared for it much.. 
 I had high hopes of an engineered CD that would help my newborns development.  Instead I got a CD with 8-10 tracks of classical music - that's it (and the tracks aren't even labeled so that I know the composer/song).  There are none of the nature sounds, verbal messages, biorhythms, or heartbeats that are promised on the cover.  Just a plain classical music CD 
 The 2 stars is the average I give to all the fable books written by Patrick.   The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: 5 stars  Obviously, it is the best one. (you can see it from the sales record in Amazon). It was the first Patrick's book I read. I have finished reading the whole book in one setting and couldn't wait and jump to look for his other books. The book has a reasonable length, setting up a bit simplified, but not over-simplified, and still reasonable fable-like setting to illustrate all important team dysfunctions and team building skills. The whole book is tight and coherent and an easy but enlightening read. Highly recommended!    Death by Meeting: A Leadership Fable 4 stars  It is a good one but not as great as the five team dysfunctions. A very good explanation of all kinds of meetings and how to use each of them. I recommend you buy one, read it and keep it as a reference. One drawback is the author tried to spicy up the book so one of the main characters will occassionally scream out some rude comments if he didn't take his pills. I never work with such an unusual person and I prefer less dramatic in a management fable. (not something like in "Desperate Housewife", the neighbor besides you was a serial killer and the housewife across the street did her gardener and used her Chinese maid to bear her baby.)   I should have stopped here and never rush to read his other books..    The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive: 2 stars  This is the one made me begin to feel betrayed. If the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months, this one seems to be done within weeks. The fable setting needs more polishing works. Although the four obsessions have been presented with reasonable clariy, reading this book makes you feel that the author thinks you are an idiot. Scenarios like how the VP HR plots to damage the trust seem to be more suitable for a toddler fable rather than something for teenagers, not mentioning for managers. The rough plot affects the whole four points--though four very good points. I will recommend you to skim the whole book in less than 20 minutes by standing in a bookstore.    Five temptations of CEO 1 star?  It is the one makes me begin to feel angry. Again, if the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months, this one seems to be done within hours. The major story (95% of the book) happened in a dark train, where a poor CEO was taught about these five temptations by some ghost-like old men, who turned out later to be the previous CEOs in the SAME company! Again the five temptations are all great and worthwhile points. It is the plot that made me sick. If you have a chance, skim the whole book in less than FIVE minutes.   Silos, Politics and Turf Wars NEGATIVE 1 star  The worst one. Negative 1 star is because it wasted my time. I thought the five temptation one was the worst until I read this one. Patrick spends most of the book to illustrate the silo problems rather than provide any solution. And he even spends many pages about the main character's struggle in balancing his work and his wife's pregnancy, which I believe, should belong to another fable about personal life balance, given how many pages the author devoted to this. From other fables, more or less, you can at least learn something. But not from this one. Forget it!  
 This isn't a textbook and a study guide! only some key word explain in the left hand side and the right hand side is blank! Don't buy this 'outline' if you only want buy a textbook 
 After reading the first book *(which was catastropha) and reading the second which was really good, I thought that the series is taking off, I was mistaken, the third book is slow, and boring, you can see very well that Stephan king has no Idea what so ever where he is going to take that series  Nothing much is happening, and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas, the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find (And better written as well) in dragon lance series, or other adventure books, also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books,  reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book, which some say is very boring  I guess this is where the adventure end for me.. 
 Alright, first of all, I have read dozens of books on nutrition and weight, etc., many of which were inspiring and very helpful. I highly doubt that many women in 2006 lack general nutrition knowledge, but if they do, it can be found easily online or in the library. Dr. Northrup's advice was ludicrous. 30 grams of carbs per day? I was encouraged when she began by citing Geneen Roth, but things deteriorated from there until I wanted to throw the book out the window. If anyone is looking for a mind-body approach to food, please, PLEASE do not read Dr. Northrup's chapter on "nutrition." Instead, I would recommend Fed Up by Dr. Wendy Oliver-Pyatt, Eating Mindfully by Dr. Susan Albers, any book by Geneen Roth, or even How Much Does Your Soul weigh, by Dr. Dorie McCubbrey. These books adress eating mindfully, allowing yourself to enjoy the foods you love while paying attention to your body's responses. Dr. Northrup's "nutrition" chapter is just another externally driven, trendy, but ultimately ineffective attempt to control weight and promote health (She calls herself a "sugar addict" and if you want information about that, read something like sugar busters (until you figure out that ALL diets will never work long-term). Anyway, I think she's a nut, and I wish that consumers were more perceptive and less desperate and likely to grasp at straws like Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom. 
 The pan doesn't have a non-stick coating so the rice sticks (go figure). Not a bad brand from what I hear - I just prefer a cooker with a non stick coating 
 I read this book and couldn't believe that it would have actually been published. I *AM* a woman and the author has NO idea what it means to be a woman except what he experienced during the 6 weeks he lived as one. The way the book is put together is like someone who waited till the night before and tried to do a term paper. It was as if all of his thoughts were just "thrown together" and it was hard to follow at times. In his *Epilogue* he said that "Gender is due to social Interaction*. Excuse me sir, BUT *GENDER* DOES NOT have anything to DO with "Social Interaction. *Gender* is what someone IS on the *inside* NOT on the outside or how they are perceived by others in society. This book was a waste of time AND money!!!! 
 The general theme of this book is, to quote Lerner and Loewe in My Fair Lady, "Why Can't a Woman be More Like a Man?"  Frankel does point out some behavioral tics that women would do well to ditch, like the infamous framing of statements as questions. But she goes far beyond that to advocate what is essentially a complete overhaul of behavior, appearance, speech, body language, office decor and relationship style. Women are urged to act in ways that feel unnatural all day, every work day. I don't think even Meryl Streep could keep that up for long. Work is inherently stressful and exhausting enough without pretending to be something you're not 50 hours a week.  Frankel encourages women to think that to be female is to be inherently flawed. Freud must be smiling, wherever he is.   Maybe to some women the pursuit of "the corner office" or however they define outward success is worth sacrificing their personhood, but I question the assumption that male behavior is the normative standard to which women must conform---or fail. The corporate and political worlds have historically been dominated by supposedly male traits of aggression, competitiveness and "winner take all" (I doubt, by the way, whether men as a group consistently display those traits), and look where that's gotten us--Enron, obscene executive compensation at the expense of other employees, falling middle class wages, growing disparity between wealth and poverty, foreign policy debacles. I think women should be trying to improve the organizations of which they are a part instead of slavishly copying male behavior that has proved dysfunctional. Let's face it---a man is going to "outman" a woman every time.  
 Ended up giving it to my parents and buying the Shark. Liked the concept of the broom with a vacuum, but tends to get just a little heavier as you keep cleaning. Not such a great job cleaning around the edges of the tiles and doesn't pick up as much when on a low angle. Just not bad that's all 
 Although John Stanley's book covers a lot of great movies, there are many problems with the overall context. For example, he seems to only have a vague recollection of a lot of the movies. Because, a lot of reviews get the stories completely wrong. (HELP's plot is not about the Beatles looking for Ringo's magic ring. Everybody knows that!)Some actors are credited with the wrong roles. Also, there are many glaring spelling errors and a slight continuity problem: A title will say "see altertnate title", and that title and review would not be in the book! Mr. Stanley, do a little more research on your films and a more careful job of copy editing and you'll have an invaluable book. The more I read your current volume, the more mistakes I find and the more I feel I could write a better book myself 
 If you're searching for a CCNA study guide, I'd advise looking elsewhere.  While reading, I've noticed many typographical errors, poor editing, and in one case, an entire paragraph repeated for no apparent reason... and I'm only up to chapter five.  Many of the explanations are difficult to understand at best.  I frequently find myself searching other resources while trying to make sense of the incomplete and often confusing material.  If you must get this guide, wait for the sixth edition.  Hopefully, it will have gone through a more thorough proofing process 
 There is nothing insightful about this book. If men didn't START wars,they wouldn't have to die in them. Men have NOT been the only ones to make great art, music & scientific discoveries. Try the fact that for most of mankind's history, women were not permitted to be professionals in these areas, and until very recently, on an historical scale, were denied the schooling necessary to make "great scientific discoveries." And if we're going to whine about things like men working in coal mines, then let's not forget all the women who have been forced into prostitution or who died in childbirth, (and sometimes still do.)    And I don't know what women you people know, but surprise guys - many of us don't actually live to shop. And, in fact, most of the women I know handle the responsibilty for juggling the household bills, and their husbands are CLUELESS about how to do that and make ends meet. Some of us even have interests we prefer to explore. Imagine that.   Life isn't fair - grow up and get over yourselves. And nobody "forces" you to do anything. If you don't want adult responsibilites- than don't accept them. It's your choice. Don't get married, don't have children, and live your lives any way you like. But for God's sake, stop your crying. It's pitiful. 
 Recently I got into a conversation with the guy next to me on the plane about some of the memorable books we had each read in the past few years.  Unfortunately, I had to recall `Confidence'-easily the worst book I've read in years.  To describe it as disappointing is to go easy on Ms. Kanter.  It is far beyond that, and altogether abominable and embarrassing.  That such a prestigious business school like Harvard can tenure a professor who writes such insipid pablum boggles the mind.  Let's start with the central (and only) idea of the book--that winning begets winning and losing begets losing.  This of course strikes most people as fairly straightforward and unworthy of a book's worth of elaboration.  Yet Ms. Kanter tumbles all over herself to spell out the details: why this is the case (as if someone with an ounce of inferential ability couldn't figure it out in a couple of minutes), how it affects team morale, how it self-perpetuates, etc...  And worst of all, endless, endless, endless examples that do nothing or very little to elucidate; rather, they simply restate what has just been said.  And they restate and restate and restate.  Tautological (I think the word was invented in anticipation of this book), boring, tedious, insipid, stupid, unthoughtful, unenergetic, disengaged, disrespectful.  All these adjectives apply forcefully to the book.  Most of all, though, it is utterly uninventive and cliched.  Turn to any page and you'll find such gems of penetrating insight as (forgive me, but these are so funny I have to quote at length):   "Winning feels good, and good moods are contagious.  Success makes it easier to view events in a positive light, to generate optimism.  It produces energy and promotes morale.  It is easier to aim high and expect to reach the target."  (P. 29)  "Overcoming obstacles, leaping over hurdles, and recovering from fumbles can strengthen a team that has the discipline not to panic under pressure." (P. 71)  "Once the 'loser' label gets slapped on, those suffering losses are set up to fail.  They find it harder to get support, harder to get opportunities." (P. 115)  "Various turnaround tasks operate on different clocks.  Bold strokes are fast and can be done by one powerful person; long marches to change culture and behavior take more time and the commitment of many people.  Execution is play by play, game by game, while strategy is season by season..." (P. 178)  "People embodying the pathologies of the past can always be replaced, but eliminating the bad does not automatically produce the good.  It takes a major effort on the part of leaders to foster confidence that a demoralized company or group is capable of working together and succeeding at it.  Restoring people's (sic) confidence in one another requires four kinds of action..." (P. 241)  "Confidence is an expectation of a positive outcome, but what happens when outcomes are negative?  The dividing line between winning streaks and losing streaks is the choice of behavior in response to setbacks...  That decision to build rather than retreat, to rally rather than get discouraged, involves viewing setbacks through an optimistic lens, as an opportunity to learn and move on." (P. 357)  And it just goes on and on, mercilessly and cluelessly.   The wisest, most incisive business people read, study and think about far more than just sports and business.  I would recommend Ms. Kanter first enroll in a decent freshman-level literature or history seminar.  There she can learn to write and, with some effort on her part and perhaps a bit of luck, to formulate some imaginative approaches to problem-solving.  Beyond this bilge, I have had the good fortune to come across many books that have helped address confidence.  These are: selected essays by Montaigne and Emerson, `Hamlet', Whitman's "Song Of Myself", David Herbert Donald's biography `Lincoln', `Emotional Intelligence', `Flow', and Jack Welch's `Winning'.  `Confidence' inspires confidence only in the realization that you (no matter who you are) are at least intelligent enough to be the "Ernest L. Arbuckle Professor" at Harvard Business School 
 Tool is new to me, having been introduced to Laterus in 2005... This new album 10,000 Days is off the chain.  The band is fluid and generates or should I say radiates energy from their music.  It's nice to hear metal played clean, tight and leaving you with wanting to play the album over and over again 
 As one of the reviewers noted in his review, I too have given many postive marks to those who have given five-star reviews for this novel; because some reviewers have made very good arguments in defense of this novel. [I never give negative marks on anything, even if I don't like a review, but I do give plenty of positives] Therefore, before you begin to throw the bricks and sling your arrows at me, please let me try and explain why I gave this book such low marks. First of all, I have tried to read--or at least decipher "Finnegans Wake" on four different occasions. I see from some of the reviews that anyone who attempts to disagree with this novels merits gets pelted with negative marks. For those of you who enjoy this novel, good for you! I do not profess to be as knowledgeable as some of you may be on this books merits. But I DO KNOW WHAT I LIKE! And I did not like this novel.  I first tried reading "Finnegans Wake" when I was in High School [it was not required reading] because I heard so much about it that I wanted to read something challenging. And challenging was an understatement. Realizing I was young, I attempted it much later while in the military. As if military life were not frustrating enough. It was not until I entered college, where I was reguired to read the novel, that I did so with true earnest: Due to the fact that I had to write an essay on the novel. I did receive an A minus on the paper. However, to be honest, this was after profusely littering the paper with as much b***s***, that to me Joyce littered his novel with. My professor must have seen some great merit in this essay---at least I felt so at the time.  However, wanting to truly understand the novel, I decided to REALLY try and capture what Joyce was trying to write. This too led to my dislike of the novel. Not so much with the books difficulty [although that was a problem], but with the simple question: Is it really worth reading? My answer? No! For me a novel has to give me that quality of enjoyment that makes the journey a delightful one. It has to capture my soul! This novel never did capture my soul. Give me unabridged editions [the only ones I read] of "The Count of Monte Cristo" by Dumas, "Les Miserables" by Hugo, "War and Peace" by Tolstoy [once is enough please] and more importantly, my favorite author, Dostoevsky, "Notes From the Underground," "Crime and Punishment,"  and "The Brothers Karamazov." These novels have given me something back in my life for the efforts that I put into reading them. They were profound and affected me deeply. They ALL gave me something in my life.   In conclusion, to those who find this novel worth the high praise it has garnered, I respectfully disagree. There are many great novels from which to choose to spend and evening, afternoon, or morning perusing. And while I do not look negatively on your opinions; if this book gives you enjoyment, then great for you. For me, however, the book gave me nothing. Nor do I wish to spend what little time we are alloted in our short life to spend it on this type of reading. That is my honest opinion. I am sure a 5 star review will give me many positive marks, but that is not why this review exists, or what I am about. This is just my honest opinion.   Today I am going to start reading two novels that I have been wanting to read for some time, but have put off until recently. "Growth of the Soil", by Knut Hamsun, and "The Master and Margarita," by Mikhail Bulgakov. I hear they are good novels; and after laboring over "Finnegans Wake" for too many hours in my life, I will begin to start on that reading list of mine. I'll let you know how these two novels work out. One thing I am pretty sure of, however, is that they will probably not frustrate me as much as "Finnegans Wake" did; and in fact, no other novel has been more of a disappointment to me than Joyce's so-called masterpiece 
 I'm not Christian. I'm Agnostic and I picked up the book because I thought it looked interesting and I wanted to learn something about Christianity.  This is perhaps one of the worst books I've ever read. Let me be clear that I am saying nothing against religion in this review. I cant judge that, but I can review this terrible writing. LaHaye and Jenkins seem to have no concept of motivation, logic, or storytelling. It's as if when writing the book they had ideas of where the characters should end up, but then used the first idea that popped into their heads about how that should happen with no critical thought at all.   As stated before, the names of the characters should have given me pause, the most egregous being Chang Wong, a name so stereotyped that I cant believe the authors have ever met an Asian. At this book in the series the world has devolved into a right wing nutjob survivalist fantasy, where the TribForce(...) is living literally underground, in rebellion against the New World Order(who call themselves, wait for it: the New World Order).   The final battle of the Apocalypse is fought on ATV's and horses.  Jesus. 
 This is a perfect example of false advertisement. If you're like the many that i've heard of trying to order a remote for the Playstation 2, Don't order this one unless you have a newer model. The picture shows an IR unit but it doesn't come with one. So save yourself the hassle and don't order this 
 It seems to me like Levinson barely put any effort into this book at all. There really is nothing new or groundbreaking in this book. To me, this was just a quick way for him to capitalize on his "Guerrilla Brand Name" to make an extra buck with recycled information.  The concepts in this book were so basic, they were almost insulting. Maybe if you are 14 years old and have no prior entrepreneurial experience this is the book for you. I felt ripped off. I actually ended up throwing it away... Catchy title, but it does not deliver at all 
 Do these people live in the ice ages or what.  There are some good suggestions and worksheets but this book gave me no soild plan. Ordered another book from him, guess I am out of that money too 
 I think this is possibly the most overrated series I have ever read. Since I seem to be alone in this thought, let me explain.    1) There is little to no narrative drive. Adams intrigues the reader with some interesting narrative points early on, but never actually gets to finishing the point, leaving the reader wondering why there is no resolution (was he bored when he wrote? or is he just sloppy? probably the latter).  2) There is little cohesion to bind the five part trilogy together. It's really just one random story after another. In fact,it's not really a story--it's more an extended TV series in which the writers make up plot points as they write (a la Alias). Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.  3) Only the first book seems to be truly good. After that, it goes downhill. Unfortunately, the first book, ending without a conclusion such as it is, only makes the reader want to read further, which upon completion of reading further,the reader becomes disappointed that the further reading was not as good as the initial reading, which in turn makes the initial reading not as good as initially thought. Conclusion: overrated series.  It is however, somewhat funny. Hence, the two stars 
 Triple H: N'SYNC should be called XTINKT! Shawn Michaels: You got that right Triple H! Triple H: Is it me or does Justin look like Kenny of The Spirit Squad. Shawn Michaels: Yes and he sounds like him, a wuss who would get beaten up by D-GENERATION X! Triple H: Also, Bye Bye Bye and It's Gonna Be Me are as bad as eating a rotted tuna fish sandwich. Shawn Michaels: Also, Steve Miller should sue these losers and Left Eye's estate for stealing Space Cowboy from him! Triple H: What next, Bratney Sneers calling herself The Gangsteress of Love. Shawn Michaels: We don't have to worry about XTYNCT anymore as they are disbanded, especially after Lance admitted to loving things who had last names like Clark, Cheney, Embersol and Parry. If you are not down with D-X, WE GOT TWO WORDS FOR YA(crowd yells "S*CK IT!") 
 Everyone who reviewed this piece o' crap 1 star had the right idea. Now, let me drive the point home further: this song is pathetic. Billy Joe should really quit whining about how he "walks alone". After all, Green Day is on top of the music world right now in spite of being a lame Nirvana retread. So sorry, but you don't walk alone. Maybe if he had the decency to admit he was only in it for the money, I wouldn't be so opposed to this song.  I've heard it said that this song has emotion. That's great...where? I know it's not in the bored way Billy Joe sings his uninspired, typical "Nobody-loves-me-even-though-I'm-also-a-rock-star-and-I-have-fans-on-the-other-end-of-the-world-but-becuase-I'm-a-sellout-I'll-sing-about-being-a-loser" lyrics. You want emotion? Listen to Bell Bottom Blues by Derek & the Dominoes. You can tell that Eric Clapton meant every word he said. With this annoying track, all you can tell is that Green Day is a highly overrated group. If they don't stop playing this song, and fast, I don't know what I'll  do. 
 Good deal for the price.  However, the book is very small and hard to write in.  It would be better if it was in a spiral bound book.  I found it extemely hard to write in.  Great concept, but lacking in the design of the book 
 Sean Hannity is a joke, all of these pundits are. WE should dig a hole and push them all in, then throw in a few starving tigers. That would roc 
 Author is extremely creative photographer, and book is well written.  Great for the amateur photographer who wants more from their photos 
 As a St. Jeanne d'Arc devotee, I have read quite a bit on my favorite Saint, as well as seen my share of movies.  Some were well done, none have been definitive, and others are, well, like this one.  I usually try to be a bit more intelligent, but the first word that comes to mind when I think of this particular version is CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Historically innacurate, spiritually unfaithful, this film stinks.  It is downright heretical, portraying our beloved Jeanne as having made a pact with the devil.  She is shown as a proud, haughty girl at odds with her Church.  What a bunch of bull.  The ONLY two bits of this film I appreciated were the attention given to her ring (given her by her brother), as well as the scene when she brings a child back to life (I am unaware of any other films on her that portray this true story).  Other than these, it took a lot not to walk out of the theatre when I went to see it.  In other words, BLAHHHHHHHH!  Don't waste your time, money, or soul on such non-sense 
 From Lind, verbatim: "Who won and who lost the Vietnam War?  The only complete losers were the officials of South Vietnam, whose state was erased from the map."  May the dead, maimed and mourning    find some comfort that their misery could be yet more abject: they could be suffering the pain of the war's cartographic consequences. "Necessary War"? - Unnecessay B.S 
 Avoid being egoistic -- these three words sum up the entire book, so if you already know this, don't bother with the book.  Based on other rave reviews here, and from hearing Ben Stein on the radio, I decided to give this book a try.  This book serves two purposes: as a humor book and as an inverted self-help book.  Regarding humor, I was disappointed to find the book as a whole, not funny.  I smiled a couple of times, but that was it.  In terms of the self-help aspect of the book, there is really nothing new here and Mr. Stein is very redundant - so much so that it suppresses any humor he was trying to convey. Overall the book could quickly be summed up by reading the table of contents and afterward section in the back of the book -- which is only a couple of pages.  Another weakness in the book is that Mr. Stein tries to address too wide of an audience and on the same page he will address you as wife, husband, and student -- this makes parts of the book awkward to read, and I'm surprised editors didn't catch this.  Thankfully I picked this book up at my library today and didn't buy it, because frankly, I don't think it is worth the money and wasn't what I expected from a man of Mr. Stein's noteriety 
 Dr. Weart has received an extra star for his attempt to cover the early history of climate science. That's it.  I was kind of disgusted by this book because what I expected was a story about some scientific discoveries connected with the global climate. A story about the history of science is always fun to read even if it is a little bit biased - for example towards the advocates of the global warming which was expected in this case.  Instead, this book is mostly a story about the money. It's a story about a group of greedy people who were not satisfied with their funding as the scientists and with the "boring" objective tasks that a scientist must usually solve, and who always wanted to find new sources of funding by claiming a "discovery" of something new and sensational. And Dr. Weart is completely open and reveals his opinion that it is OK if science is affected by politics. In fact he enjoys it, and as a historian of science, he is happy to analyze this interaction.  Let's hope that I am not the only one who believes that it is unacceptable for scientific research to be affected by politics, and on the other hand that science cannot determine which policies should be adopted.  If you see the book, try to count how many times the word "funding" appears in it. I find it completely scary. The truth in science does not depend on the money! These global warming alarmists seem to be a culture for which science is a hostage and a tool to achieve something completely different.  If you open this book, you will see many stories about some scientists who were supposed to measure the concentration of some gas somewhere - according to the old-fashioned, objective rules of science. Because they knew that it's unlikely that anything shocking would be found in this way, they decided that they wanted to measure something completely different - something that can be used to argue that there is a big "discovery" - this bogus discovery was finally called "global warming" (well, after the attempts in the 1970s to call it "global cooling").   It is a great "theory" that predicts something 20 years from now - a short enough period to scare the people, but a long enough period to get funding for a long time and to allow the people to forget that you were wrong once it's proved. It's a theory that Weart admits won't ever be quite convincing, but nevertheless the decision making should be based on it.  The book offers, much like many similar books, simplistic arguments that the global climate is simple and its models should be right. Weart does not hesitate to claim that the temperature in 2050 will be up to 5.5 Celsius degrees higher, even though it is known that the temperature in the last 100 years only rose by 0.6 degrees or so.  Even if you forget whether the global warming is true or not, the history as described in this book is completely twisted. For example, it is focused on America only. There is nothing about the 20th century European scientists, for example. And of course, there is nothing about e.g. the influential Russian Academy of Science that identified the Kyoto protocol as a "scientifically unfounded nonsense".   Mr. Weart won't tell you such things - instead, he will brainwash you with the obnoxious lies about the "scientific consensus" - this consensus has become the only real "argument" of the "evangelists". It's because he kind of knows that Goebbels said correctly that a lie that is repeated 100 times "becomes" the truth.  The global climate has been a politicized topic for many decades - but this is one of the first books I've seen which is completely open about the fact that the global warming alarmists are twisting the data - and picking their problems - in order to get more funding and in order to support their political allies.   Weart also happily attacks the global warming skeptics by the characteristic far left-wing argument that they may have some links to the corporations. Well, I will probably prefer a person paid by a corporation over a person who wants to destroy the corporations - but the actual scientific results don't depend on such things as long as science is done properly. Weart openly says that it should not be done properly.  Weart's book actually describes the very same people as Crichton's "State of Fear". The difference is that Crichton's novel ends with a happy end - the evil eco-terrorists are either shot, or eaten by the eco-friendly native tribes - while Weart's novel ends as a horror: the same people are celebrated as heroes who are almost allowed to declare their rubbish comments called "global warming" as one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs of the century.  I am ashamed that these global warming people are sometimes identified as our colleagues.  Dr. Lubos Motl, Harvard Universit 
 One wonders why anyone would work so hard to bring together a collection of unappealing recipes 
 I bought one of these when I bought my Macbook to keep it in pristine condition, just a few months ago.  I just popped it off to clear out a little bit of debris that got caught between the cover and the Macbook and find that all along the cover has been scratching my Macbook.  They should at least have had the foresight to make the plastic in contact with the Macbook of a softer material, or created a design where it won't rub against the laptop.  Really stupid design.  It may have protected against some very minor scratches,but likely I'm worse off for using this cover (scratches on the outside of the cover are more evenly dispersed than those now on the macbook but both are of similar severity). I don't think in the long run it was worth $40, and I feel very misled by the marketing for this cover.  Given the choice again I would have either gone for another brand or just saved my money 
 Imagine someone combining the scripts for Zardoz and Independence Day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing....then you would have Battlefield Earth.  It is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars.  You become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of John Travolta putting his heart and soul into a project.   Just awful. If Battlefield Earth and Pluto Nash were humans they would deserve to be executed 
 Do you giggle uncontrollably when poking corpses with a stick? If so, look no further, this book is for you.   I understand a book like this will appeal to a certain demographic. I guess I shouldn't have expected much, and I certainly didn't expect a literary masterpeice, but this was the first book in awhile I just felt like giving up on. I didn't, since it's so short, but I may just as well have. It is not that the book is so "grotesque" or "disturbing" as seen described elsewhere. The author either left out or was incapable of the proper narrative to make the potentially disturbing scenes at all vivid. Unfortunately, that applies to all aspects of this book.   The entire book is in rural vernacular, including ignoring proper punctuation. But the end result is that nothing is described in any detail. It's like reading a poorly worded list of stuff that happened. It's almost as if he wasn't really trying very hard, or as if the story really was told by a simpleminded country person - an omniscient one that can read people's minds. I suppose the idea could have worked, but doesn't. Not a terrible read, just annoying and vague. With so many other good books out there, why waste your time 
 I bought into a subscription of this magazine sight unseen.  That was a bad decision.  After having received two issues, I continue to be disappointed.  The quality of the art & design, and products displayed overall are dreadfully amateurish and in most cases incredibly tacky. I would be hard pressed to think that anyone in pursuit of help with romanticing their home would be inspired by this magazine.  
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 Interesting observations about rehab and kicking a bad drinking problem, so part of the book is worthwhile and inspiring.  About half way through I had to quit.  It was too much like reading the diary of a shallow teenage girl.  (Will he call me?  Did the gorgeous guy wear that tight shirt to impress me?  All I do is think about him.  Is he thinking about me? Oh, please, please, please, let him say something to me.  I love you, but I'm not in love with you.)  On and on. The humor is mildly amusing, but seems forced; it doesn't ring quite true, like the author is trying too hard.  An earlier negative reviewer said they didn't like the author.  It didn't prevent me from reading the book - I like the writing of a number of unlikable people.  But I now understand - the book is completely about this shallow person.  His struggle with alcohol is one of the few interesting/humane things about him.  His colleagues force him into rehab, which turns his life around.  He returns to work a changed and invigorated man, loving life, but continues to mock the people who saved him.  It doesn't dawn on him to thank them.  
 This book is totally focussed on troubleshooting serger problems. It has good pictures and great solutions to correct all types of problems. It is a wonderful resource to have on hand because it addresses many situations that other books might not. I am glad I bought it and highly recommend this book. Also keep in mind that this book is a great supplement for your other serger books 
 Having read several novels by this author, and having been delighted with his characteristic use of language, I picked up this novel from the library.  To say I was disappointed doesn't begin to describe the boredom I suffered while forcing myself to finish this book. Far too many pages are taken up with philosophical dialogue between characters whose voices are nigh indistinguishable.  While I enjoy improbable stories, deus ex machina plot twists remain distasteful to me.   If you're still interested in this book, get it from the library before you invest.  
 Another great player selling out to sell more.  Seems like another outbreak of the Kenny bug.  I'm sure any jazz aficianado would agree with me when I say that Gerald Albright is a much more comprehensive player than this album suggets.   Check out the 'Live at Birdland West' album for a taste of what Mr. Albright is really about. 
 This was the textbook for one of my Comp Science grad courses and I didn't really care for it. I think it put way too much emphasis on modeling and theory and none at all on practical implementation. You will not be able to secure a network after reading this book. This book will give you some information on security theory and really would only benefit designers of systems in the 70s-80s or academics, not IT practitioners. 
 Sorry, but this was boring to me. Couldn't get through it. After you are beaten up in the first chapter for not being perfect enough for the angels to help you out, why bother 
 One hell of a waste of money! if you are expecting alot of the same charectors from the first movie like I was, you are in for a hell of a disappointment! the only reason why I think the first one was bad ass is cause Vin Diesel was in it, and yeah it was totally bad ass! I'll tell you one thing that this damn thing has in common with the first movie is that the only real cars were destroyed, in this movie you get two real cars this time, a 1969 Camaro SS, and a 1970 Dodge Challenger r/t and they both get destroyed! who in their right mind would destroy those sexy cars! God all mighty! Don't waste your money on this movie, I wouldn't take this disappointment if it was given to me! if you are wanting to buy a kick ass movie, buy Frost bite! you won't be disappointed 
 Elizabeth Berg has written several humane, touching, so real they hurt novels about relationships: patient/nurse (the affecting "Never Change"), families ("Say When"): and she's  written them with uncommon grace, knowledge and understanding of what makes Us tick. The genesis of "We are All Welcome Here" was a letter from a fan, Marianne Raming asking Berg to write about her Mother who was stricken with Polio before Marianne was born. In the prologue to this novel, Berg at first recoils then warms to the idea, telling her fan: "(your) Mother's circumstances will serve only as inspiration for a different story that I will make up...if you want her real story to be told, contact a non-fiction writer." Unfortunately, Berg may have had better luck writing this book in the non-fiction form for as it is "WAAWH" is mostly flat and uninvolving except that the central story: a Mother trying everything that she can to raise her child despite being incapacitated by Polio and living in an Iron Lung, is without a doubt rife with drama and tension. Berg's novel isn't.  What it is, is flat and oddly enough very much like reportage.Berg, in her quest to avoid the trappings of non-fiction, falls victim to them nonetheless with the "just the facts" style of prose she adopts here. And then I read this gorgeous scene at the very end of the novel: "It's everywhere, she said and those were the last words I heard her speak. She meant redemptive beauty, I think. Despite her many obstacles, what my mother succeeded best in doing was appreciating the many forms of beauty in life...as well as its possibilities. And she relished perhaps more than any other mother could the growth of her daughter, seeing in me a part of herself set free." If only this novel as a whole could have been as elegant, as perceptive, as intelligent as these last few words on the last page of this book. 
 Conclusions:  To start from the end I got the Xacti CA6, tested it and returned it. Here are the pros and cons.  Pros -  1. Very small, just put in your pocket and go 2. Easy and simple controls 3. Super fast start up from sleep mode 4. Good video quality when lighting conditions are good 5. the ability to take stills while in video mode (I had no issue with the video pausing, no way around that) 6. You get video and 6mp stills in one device for a reasonable price 7. SD card that records for a long time 8. Easy transfer to computer for editing   Cons -   1. Indoor video unacceptable, although the video is brighter the ones my Sony digicam takes, it is extremely grainy (more so than my Sony digicam videos!!) 2. Super slow zoom when in video mode 3. In good lighting it is very difficulty to take stills that are not blurry (especially when trying to capture a kid on the move, for scenery it might be OK) 4. In low lighting stills are unusable (even at short distance) due to a very, very weak flash. 5. Red eye almost every time the flash works 6. Strap is a joke 7. No lens cover  So in short, on paper this camera is great, I love having the SD format rather than tape or DVD, the size is amazing and the ability to take both video and stills at a high resolution is priceless.  But....the stills are useless both in good and bad lighting (see above) and the video is usable only if shot in very good lighting conditions (for a new dad that shoots many videos indoors this is impractical). This camera is only for outdoor people who shoot in good lighting conditions and have a very very steady hand (for taking stills). For almost everyone else it is not adequate, I will have to compromise on having both a dedicated still camera and a miniDV camcorder  (going for the Elura 100)..... Ya, I know people told me that this was the best option beforehand, I was hoping to prove them wrong....; - ( 
 The lady can sing, but her "Christian" message is compromised because of her part in "Chasing Papi", where she played a woman who - had she had the chance - would have hopped into bed with her on-screen boyfriend prior to marriage.  It's "Crystal Clear" to me that Jaci broke my heart in a million pieces when she played that part.  It's really tragic to see such a beautiful young lady with such a opowerful voice and message now reduced to nothing more than a hypocritical wannabee, much in the same way that Stacie Orrico is now becoming.....and is it just me, or is it coincidence that these two womens' album covers look strikingly similar?  It appears their paths in life are similar, too: compromising a message and a stand that once set them worlds apart.  As with a recent review of Orrico that I made, I'll give Jaci Velasquez her due:  she can sing, and what I mean by that is sing the roof off of a house!  This album was excellent.....was.  Now, whenever I think or hear of Jaci Velasquez, I can only think one word:  HYPOCRITE 
 After about 10 weeks of intensive dance lessons or a season of cheer practice your child should be easily able to perform the first five minutes of the "warm up".  Otherwise, they will be very frustrated. It is very fast, very complicated.  Well Choregraphed but even the "break it down" segment moves at double speed.   
 One of the most monumental events in the history of American sports, the 2001 World Series is perhaps more worthy than any other sports topic of a comprehensive, informed and inspired film document. This film is not that document.  The premise of the filmmakers is that the New York Yankees, because they chose to play after September 11 rather than abandoning the season, should be regarded as saints. They then maintain that it was the patriotic duty of the Yankees' opponents to roll over and lose in order to improve the moods of their non-playing interview subjects (all New Yorkers). Meanwhile, the players responsible for the most courageous and inspiring performance in baseball history are cast as villains, and the city that experienced the greatest moment of sports-inspired civic pride in American history is ignored.  Here are three reasons why this World Series will be talked about in 2051 that were barely, if it all, talked about in this movie:  1. There has never been a greater contrast in the backgrounds of the two participants in a professional sports championship: the most celebrated, decorated team in American sports history against one that was only playing its fourth season. The Yankees were fielding teams when Arizona was not even a state! I would make the argument that not only was this the most important event in Arizona SPORTS history, but by way of having so little traditionally defined history, this was the biggest thing ever to happen in Arizona period!    2. By virtue of becoming the first pitcher to win three games in one series since Mickey Lolich, Randy Johnson became the unchallenged star of the series. The most spectacular pitching performer since Nolan Ryan, this series marked his transformation from star to legend. While it's unfortunate that he did not make himself available for interviews that is no reason to be giving him passing mentions instead of prominent ones.  3. There is no more magical moment in sports than a bottom-of-the-ninth come from behind rally by the home team to win the seventh game of a World Series. What will place this in the realm of the greatest sports legends is that it occurred in the context of a blown save by the greatest relief pitcher in the history of the game.  For Pete's (and Pinnacle Peak's) sake let's all hope that fans from both of these cities someday get the film about this series that they deserve.  
 To be honest, I didn't read it all from cover to cover.  Of that which I read, I found it was a lot of psycho babble and I always found myself asking "How do you know that?" They did include references, but I found myself questioning the basic logic.  Also, I didn't find this book helpful in being a better mother, which is the reason I bought it in the first place. 
 BPM is solution for all problem businesses facing today: from Snow White animation to unknown changes of next 50 years -- that's the description, comments, history reivew and the coclusion from Chapter one to Chapter nine. The "why" and "how" are missed. Too bad 
 i am a huge De Lint fan, but i cannot drag myself through Moonheart.  this is an early attempt by him to solidify his ideas about celtic and native american mythology and their presence in a modern setting, and for that perhaps it was groundbreaking at the time, but after his later books, this is painful to read.  the characters are largely flat, though the setting of tamson house is a good and intriguing one. the super secret paranormal branch of the canadian mounties (!) is never made believable or interesting and i kept losing track of the cops' names, which didn't matter as they kept dying anyway.  anytime he creates a character of a specific ethnicity, the cartoonish stereotyping and deeply labored ethnic dialogue are painful to behold (i.e., the "rasta" man who begins every sentence with "I and I"); the character of keiran with his constant declarations of "NOM DE TOUT!" and "LORD JUMPIN' JESUS!" is annoying beyond endurance -- and furthermore, what is he supposed to be, french canadian or southern gothic with those odd declarations?  the scenes with the native american "manitou" read like bad B westerns written by Carlos Castaneda.  do read De Lint, but don't start here.  his later books based in fictional Newford are his best, especially the books that are collected short stories -- they're wonderful.  if you want to read one of his early Ottawa-based books, read Jack of Kinrowan which combines two shorter novels into one and which is far, far better done.  i'd hate to have someone pick up Moonheart and think that's all there is to De Lint 
 Threads of Life is really disappointing. Shadows Fall once showed great promise. What happened? We get the same guitar riffs, same song set up and same bad vocals. Brian Fair has to be one of the worst and most predictable singers out there. Anyone who has seen them live (like me) can tell you that. Guitar work is good but we've all heard this before. Nothing new or innovative. Some solid but predicatable drum work. Do they have a bass player? Metalcore is on its way out.  Stick with "Art of Balance" or "The War Within". Or save your money and buy the new CD from Machine Head or Dark Tranquility. 
 This book has very limited Mexican food. The recipes are poor, as are the directions. I suggest trying a different book 
 Who ever thought you could make a boring book about the tragedy of Sept.11.  Spiegelman's In the Shadow of No Towers is dull as dishwater.  I'm sure he had the best of intentions when he published this book, but there is little if any resonance in this book.  In the last pages there are reprints of Platinum Age comics...WHY.  I guess I'm just too dense to appreciate this book, but I definitely felt nothing after reading this.  I think the good reviews for In the Shadow of No Towers are a mixture of the Emporer's New Clothes syndrome and elitist hype 
 I agree with David Thomson when he says few audiences in the West would be content to view an American epic composed solely of battles and their contexts. Kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the West was entrenched with "Kagemusha" and "Ran", he knew what (American) audiences think of as heroic and mystical about "historical" Japan: Kurosawa's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what Americans (or Westerners) imagine about Japan. He was not popular in Japan (where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded, hence the suicide attempt). I am not saying that the work is rubbish - there is no "ugly" shot in either "Ran" or "Kag" - merely that there are more "authentically Japanese" films out there to choose from.   
 Its unfortunate that freedom of speach also allows authors such as this to completley fabricate and slander an entire culture.  There has been documented scientfic evidence of the fabrications that substantiated human sacrifice and the so called god theory.  The reality is, europeans LACKED the understanding and knowledge that would allow them to comprehend the indigenous cultures they encountered.  Their belief system was so different, that they saw EVIL where there was none.  To this day there has been NO archeological or scientific PROOF of sacrifices.  This book is nothing more than a good piece of fiction 
 I never got to use this sheet. I pre-washed it and put it to dry on low heat as I've done with all the baby clothes. I later saw the label said to air dry, which seems ridiculous for something that'll be washed so often. Anyway, it shrunk and doesn't fit over the co-sleeper mattress. If you have time/space to air dry it, it's probably a fine product. 
 While the book is full of nice pictures, the actual useful projects are rather scant to my liking. I did have one item project that I am interested in pursuing, but overall, the overcrowded pictures take away from the item for the project. The instructions are a bit wanting, leaving gaps in the process, ex. the making of the teacup-based lamp where the actually steps and pictures for the fitting of the hardware is abscent 
 Alhthough Polsky has some interesting insights on the art market, they are relatively few, and are separated by numerous pointless anecdotes and even more pointless details.  For example, in describing a visit to a colleague staying at an upscale Manhattan hotel, Polsky writes that (in case he wanted to stay there in the future) he decided to ask a few questions of the concierge, "a moderately attractive young lady, who was wearing a very businesslike skirt, jacket, silk blouse, and matching bow." (p. 208).  Why exactly does it matter that the concierge was "moderately attractive"?  So we can gauge how excited Polksy was?  So the reader can decide whether he or she would rather stay at a hotel where the concierges are more than "moderately" attractive?  Notably, Polsky then does not even have any questions for the concierge -- so it appears that the whole event was not designed to give him an opportunity to find out if he'd want to stay there in the future (as he claims), but simply so he can decide how "attractive" the concierge is.  The book abounds in such pointless detail.  The author comes across as self-impressed to an extraordinary degree, and while his occasional insights on the art world are interesting, the reader must suffer through a remarkable amount of banal detail.  Not recommended 
 While i was inspired by all of other castaneda books (i have not yet read second ring of power)  this one was my least favorite.  It did not have any of the great quotes of don Juan Matus or commical actions of Don Genaro, and it was not inspiring. it did have a few interesting parts here and there, but overall was kinda [crummy] compared to his other book 
 I'm surprised this show got past Season 1. Honestly, more talent can be found in my local karaoke bar. This show does NOT discover talent, they produce and market it. It is really demeaning to musicians everywhere. The judges are a joke, I guess the producers tell them what to say. Simon "the jerk" Cowell tries hard to be rude to everyone, hey...he has made a living out of it. Randy Jackson's vocab is limited to "yo", "yeah" and "dawg". Paula, who's the only one who I think deserves to even comment on the singers..unfortunately praises everyone, be it for their performance/energy/character/looks/(fill with any word of your choice). All in all, a total disaster...only in shows this sh*tty, can no-talents like William Hung be hailed as a celebrity. I am shocked people other than the families of those participating would actually spend time and money voting for these posers. On a more positive note, it's good that people don't actually buy the albums, thus resulting in total disappearing acts from Idol winners like Ruben and Fantasia...now we just need the American public to stop tuning in to the shows. Well, hope is all we have, right 
 This is my 3rd Nora Roberts book.  I've read the first 2 in the 3 Sisters trilogy, and decided to read Chesapeake Blue while I (very eagerly) await Face the Fire in the mail.  Perhaps I was spoiled by the characters, the conflicts, and the love stories in 3 Sisters, but this book pales in comparison.  The Quinns are meant to be a family whose perfect and deep love for one another is tempered by a course and affectionate manly banter.  Sort of like 7th Heaven meets a beer commercial.  Anyways, Seth is supremely talented, handsome, kind, and sizzling in the sack; in other words, a stock Nora Roberts male character.  Alas, he is also entirely thick-headed, vain, and has the mental processes of a mule when faced with his "problem", which he only exacerbates over the course of the book.  So he has a floozy of a mother who blackmails him into huge sums of money on pain of, what, her leaking a story to the press which, once she removes all the parts that reflect poorly on her, would be about 2 sentences long?  And, he can't tell his troubles to his family that he loves "so" much?  I mean, I wouldn't tell Cam anything myself, because he seems to deal with every moment of emotion by pitching someone off the end of a pier in a fit of manly love.  But Anna and the rest seem like good candidates for a chat.  Finally, Drusilla.  First, the name makes her sound like a villian in a Disney movie.  Second, she is flat as a pancake, and I would pay for problems like hers.  At the very end, she exhibits a spark of life, and sort of morphs into another stock Nora Roberts stock character: the sassy, smart, no-nonsense, gal who steps up to defend her man.  Which, I like that character.  In my limited experience, Nora Roberts writes female friendships and falling in love brilliantly, but her male friendships need a few less put-downs and jaws clenched to supress brotherly emotion.  And, I agree with the other reviewers who wanted Seth to end up with Aubrey.  
 You have sent me a model different from for the one that I asked!!!! I live in Chile ..... there is no way of returning it ...... 
 I work on a helpdesk where our employer purchased a set of CS10s (along with a set of older-style lifters for which I cannot find a model number) to allow us to move freely about the office while taking support calls. While generally very functional, they exhibit a few *very* severe problems. We have gone through a total of nine of them without resolving these issues:    The units will, seemingly at random, produce incredibly loud feedback to both sides of the connection. This seems to be related to the phono jack on the remote unit, but also depends on physical location (some areas experience this more frequently than others; so far, air conditioning seems a likely cause).    The units will periodically bleed across channels. Changing channel on the remote unit or range on the base unit does not affect this -- you will be treated to static and the combined calls of all other units in the area, typically until you replace the remote unit (although the remote units appear to correct themselves after time).    They also exhibit frustratingly poor lifter response (even after replacing our older lifters with HL10s). This appears to be a duplexing problem; when placing an outgoing call, the lifter responds fine, but if a call is being received, then the signal used to ring the remote unit (even if ringing is turned off) appears to block the lift signal, not only failing to answer the call but also preventing you from using the Talk button for 5-10 seconds afterward. When this happens multiple times in a row, it becomes entirely impossible to answer the phone at all.    I am very surprised to read so many favorable reviews. After having replaced every single unit at least once, we still find them to be barely adequate for our operations. I do not believe that we have received defective units every single time, nor that our environment is unusual in how we use them. I recommend all potential buyers approach this product with caution 
 The Amazon description says Vol. 1-3, boxed set, hardcover.  That is all true.  What they don't tell you is that there are actually six volumes.  The box in which it comes is clearly marked, "Volumes 1-3 (of six)."  That would have been a much better description for Amazon to have used.  If you have volumes 4-6 and you are looking to complete the set, this book is for you.  If you are looking for the complete set, look elsewhere 
 This book is a collection of reviews from the New York Times, containing many different writers. The book has a wide range of reviews, which is good, but you can find a good list of great movies in other, better books (and on the web too).   The big problem I have with the book is with the critics. They're the most pretentious people I have ever read. They seem incredibly detached from all the movies they write about. They seem held back, as if they're almost afraid of liking the movie too much. I wonder if they would give their favorite movie of all time anything above a three out of ten.   One of the reasons Roger Ebert is the best critic today is because, when he really loves a movie, you can tell, not by his star rating, but by how he works so hard to convey his admiration for it (or his disgust, in the case of a bad movie.) I don't quite see how the pressure of deadlines could force these writers to distance themselves from these films, but it would've been nice if they injected a little humanity into their reviews. Definitely not recommended. 
 I can't believe how complimentary the reviews on here are for these poems. Ugh. When I read them, I want to tear every last hair out of my skull. 
 I, for one, am not a fan of inspirational stories. I honestly thought that this is one of the most stupid books I ever read. I had to read this for summer reading and I really did not enjoy it. At all. Yay, so three boys from the ghetto became doctors. Incredible. Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. Don't waste your time. It's stupid. 
 Although there was a wealth of information within the book, it was almost impossible to locate through the Index.  If you are trying to find an explanation or discussion quickly, do not bother with this book, as we found it necessary to leaf through pages and scan for key words, which often were noted museums, churches, palaces, etc.    For ease of use, and because of its weight, it should be separated into 2-3 volumes. We stopped carrying it very soon after arriving in Eastern Europe. 
 She seems to have been heavily influenced by both azuza street crowd i.e. much of today's pentecostalism/charasmatics i.e. the toronto/brownsville blessing (a history which is fraught with charlatans and very biblically problemic) and hollywood.  In studying many of her sermons what is readily apparent is the lack of any solid biblical understanding or doctrine.  It was just get saved and jesus loves you.  A cozy accomodation to the masses who can pretty much define that jesus they want to believe in and then follow.  
 === quote   Pay no attention to the negative criticisms by those who are obviously Moonies. This is should be required reading. Nansook Hong had the courage to endure and to finally escape the clutches of this dangerous cult led by the Korean flake who thinks he's God.  === end   Funny, so people should not listen to the story of those who are still within the UM, why is this?   Also Rev. Moon himself doesn't claim to be God, this is always said by others, Rev.Moon stresses the point without God he would be nothing... 
 Reading this book is difficult, I don't know if I'll be able to get through it.   12 point type gets a 12 point paragraph indent, 14 point type gets a 14 point paragraph indent, this book has paragraph indents of .5 inch, which suggests the type should be 36 points  It's as if the book is trying to hypnotize a person into being a good typesetter, my eyes zigzagged back and forth, and this voice started saying, "you will be a good typesetter, you will be a good typesetter." Something about the excessive white space at the beginning of the paragraphs was putting me to sleep. So any good information about typesetting will be hard to extract. 
 I know exactly what another reader means here, but it seems to be the norm of using the same words for the relaxion, but throwing in a few words for whatever the title of the CD claims to be. It doesn't do guided imagery justice, which works very well with some other authors 
 I loved the original book "The Sherbrooke Bride".  I have read all of the bride books and this is by far the worse.  The only reason I have given this book two stars is because it lets us know what has become of our favorite characters.  Otherwise, this book is a complete waste of time.  If you want to be thoroughly entertained I suggest reading the first book which happens to be about Alex and Douglass.  Skip the second for Ryder's story is so-so.  I would then read Sinjun's search for love.  It is very funny and captivating.  Ms. Coulter generally writes really good books.  She should have quit while she was ahead 
 I learn from my experience if only a handful of people rated 5 stars don't believe it.  I only read 15% of this book, and it is really really borring. I didn't laugh one bit.  This book say if I am not laughing than I don't have humor.  That's a lame excuse for a boring book.  If this is really 5 stars, I can write a 10 stars book for people to laugh at intelligent and witty jokes, not stupid unlaughable joke like this book.  But, Amazon is way cool, 5 stars bookstore.  I have bought quite a few books (> 50) at Amazon, and I will continue to buy it.  Recommend: I did laugh with for better or for worst by Lynn Johnston.  Clean and witty whole some family jokes.  Judy Carter is also very funny.  These two ladies are way cool  
 We purchased this purcolator for Christmas 2003.  Every other pot is weaker than tea, many grounds are left in the bottom of the pot.  Once the coffee is done, the warmer continues to boil the coffee making it bitter and burnt.  The auto shut off did not work and boiled the pot dry.  I am returning the pot and purchasing a Farberware for half the price 
 Gene Hackman is Jedidiah Tucker Ward, an aging yet tireless litigant for the public good, enemy of evil corporate type and the bane of overpaid attorneys everywhere.  On the other side of this gap of good and evil is Maggie Ward, Jed's headstrong daughter.  Between them is a products liability lawsuit involving car lights that kill people.  The premise suggests the ending - Jed will win the day, but not before his daughter has been transformed into a noble attorney.  Jed will fight the good fight (which will require supreme grandstanding) while Maggie learns just how amoral her side really is.  What robs this courtroom thriller is what's missing in virtually every courtroom thriller - a case that could go either way, an actual case in controversy.  Maybe because of the amount of preemptive litigation required just to produce a major motion picture, Hollywood is simply too beholden to lawyers to make a truly biting film about them.  Instead of a compelling case, we have one that's ready for our verdict as soon as we've seen the suits worn by either side or their offices.  The case in "Class Action" is one you can typify as "David & Goliath", which is to say that the end has been fated to be won by the little guy by a higher power.  There's no way that we're going to see a case won (even by dishonest means) by Donald Moffat's hired band of Harvard-trained professional liars, and there's no way anybody in the audience is going to buy their arguments.  Maggie's bosses are so transparently bad, that not only do they screw up, but even their explanations are patently evil  Even so, the film stacks the deck against them by cynically attributing to them as evil what are basic facts of life for lawsuits of this kind - namely that products liability plaintiffs will make overbroad requests for discovery, and defendants respond in kind by deluging the other side with documents responsive to the request but otherwise valueless.  For a thriller about high-paid lawyers, "Class Action" has all the legal acumen of high-school mock-trial, with fewer suprises 
 Let's face it, I have a million things I'd rather spend my precious time doing that reading a book about a cute and lovable newlywed who has gotten into a horrible accident and suffered amnesia... only to remember halfway through the book that her darling husband is dead.  How rotten is that? Even a dose of "Ghost-esque" contact with the dearly departed loved one who assures her she will love again was not enough to restore my faith in humanity and Marian Keyes. As the English would say, "What is she playing at? 
 I bought this. It is sacriligious and NOTHING at all like the Biblical story. It is immoral. I threw it in the trash because I did not want anyone else to see it 
 I would recommend not buying this CD if you actually want the songs listed on the detail by Amazon 
 Bill does a good job here explaining the problems with the current morality of American's but other then that,   he sounds as if he is constantly trying to uphold his beliefs on us, continually bitching about people who do not choose to appear on the the o-reilly-factor, and downing everyone who has a bad word to say about him..   he claims he is not conservative, yet this book shows his support for almost every republican in power..  (who in there right MIND can say that george bush genuinely cares for our country?!) and defines himself to be 'with the working-class..'   POSER! 
 I'm an active duty soldier and business student. I have experience in the civilian business world, and will re-enter business upon completion of my term.  Mr. Sullivan apparently has little experience outside of the  military, and it shows. Although much can be learned from the military in  terms of structure, team development, and decision making, it must be  severely tempered with a dose of good business sense. The Army does not  operate for profit, and therefore will never achieve the same level of  pursuit of excellence that a highly motivated businessman can. Because the  Army lacks both customers and shareholders, underperforming leaders  routinely get away with murder in their progress reports, since much of  what they do in peacetime is subjectively interpreted. In business, profit  and loss are not easily concealed, and underperformers are shown the door.  Change is painfully slow in the Army's layered bureacracy, and a modern  business this sloth-like soon becomes lunch. The authors obscure any  possible connections to civilain business practices by conspicuous absence  of examples and analogies, instead substituting "there I was" war  stories and abstracts that a civilian will not easily relate to or care  about. The introductions to each chapter read more like West Point  commencement addresses, and are about as interesting and as long. Overall,  the book could be useful if more concise and relevant. However, since it's  more likely to be read by Army officers rather than business people, it  will still sell. For real business generalship, study Al Dunlap 
 Where does one begin? This book is about 90 percent Michelle martyring herself, and 10 percent truth.   To begin, she whisks us very briefly through the 90's Vampire movement. I do mean briefly, when it comes to providing deep facts. Merely, she paints a picture of the vampire culture having to hide. That is already common knowledge to most interested in a book like this.   She definately enjoys painting a picture that she began this movement of Psychic Vampirism, yet it existed far beyond anything she still knows. She isn't the originator, only someone who decided to share her own views.  Therein lies a massive problem with this book. If we listen to Michelle, she began this movement, to the point of liberating a culture. She saved the modern vampire.   On top of it, her "energy workbook" is actually written for her own Vampire "house". So while reading over well known techniques one can learn in coffee houses, she keeps throwing her houses name into each segment of teaching. As if to tell you "We made this".  No, Michelle. You didn't "make" this movement. You didn't make anything new at all. You simply neglect to give credit to those who came before you, and who still exist today, snickering.  To anyone who wants a book on Psychic Vampires, you should take this with a grain of salt. And buy it used, if you buy it at all. I don't even think it was worth 13 dollars just to read such an egotistical book 
 Excellent resource for those desiring to know how to create really beautiful jackets for men or women.  Completely replaces pattern instructions purchased with the envelope 
 I hate this band.THEY WERE THE LEAST RESPECTED GROUP IN THE 70'S.THE ONLY GROUP WHICH MATTERED IN THE 1970'S WAS PINK FLOYD.I JUST CANT UNDERSTAND THAT WHY IN 2006 WOULD PEOPLE WANT TO LISTEN TO THESE TALENTESS DI**HEADS WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH BETTER MUSIC AVAILABLE THAN THIS.GET PEARL JAM'S SELF TITLED ALBUM INSTEAD.BUY THIS STUPID ALBUM IF YOU ARE STILL LIVING IN 1970'S.ZERO STAR 
 This thing is garbage. I originally had a client buy it, but we couldn't get Quick VPN to work right back then. I got the unit in the end, and it worked for a year or so. Then all of a sudden the diag light started flashing and the unit stopped working. I reset it and updated the firmware. That completely toasted it, and i had to reload the firmware with TFTP. Then there were the notorious MTU problems. Ident is still not filterable in the new firmware, among other shortcomings. You have to forward the port to nowhere manually. Finally, got it to work again for a couple of hours with the new firmware before the diag light started flashing again, and this pathetic router failed again. Now, it's going in the trash. I read that these have a CMOS battery inside them, which can cause problems and is not user-replaceable. If that's true, it's funny how none of the other old, cheap routers i have used ever had any trouble with that. Right now, my old, cheap D-Link router had to take the place of this overpriced trash. Marketing this model as a small-business router is nothing more than a joke.. 
 As others have stated the DVD mini-games are nearly impossible to play due to wonky controls. I also have no idea what the cards or pieces are for, other then they may come into play if you "win" the main game.  They should have just done a choose your own adventure type game.  It would have been less high-tech, but you could at least have a laugh when you choose "set up a perimeter" and the terrorists once again escape.  DO NOT BUY 
 I'm glad I found this book in the library and didn't buy it! After hearing the good reviews here I was shocked at how poor this book really was. I'm a fan of the paranormal and have studied it for a long time, I am always looking for new views and info whether it be pro or con. But this book is obviously a debunking manuscript. And a poor one at that! It tackles only the weakest of cases, ignores REAL evidence, and brings forth "rational" explanations that are even more far out than the paranormal explanation. The section on crop circles was horrible, dismissing it as a hoax without even LOOKING AT ANY of the fascinating evidence that this is a real occurance. Pass 
 After Cold Mountain I was sure that Thirteen Moons would be my read of the year. Unfortunately, it fell extremely short of being even a good read. I couldn't wait for it to be finished. I think the author attempted to be too sophisticated and svelte to really convey what should have been a heart-tugging and compassionate telling of the plight of the Indian Nation of the Smokey Mountains, especially the Cherokee. I felt he was writing more for an R Rated Hollywood script potential than for a much anticipated follow-on to Cold Mountain, an outstanding book by the way. Could have been another Cold Mountain but ended up, for me, a cold turkey 
 The 1991 "Our Game" is a standalone post cold war spy story by that British master, John LeCarre: and he's written several memorable spy stories, such as "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold," and the Smiley/Karla trilogy.  This book exhibits some of his virtues as a writer: unsurpassed spycraft, strong set piece openings, and closings; plots that might keep a reader up way past bedtime, sharply drawn characters given snappy dialogue, and engrossing narrative and descriptive writing.  The book opens on Tim Cranmer, forcibly retired British cold war spy; luckily for him, he seems to have more than his share of wealthy relatives,enabling a comfortable retirement as a landed winemaker.  He has acquired a beautiful, much younger mistress whom he keeps in luxury.  And he's been able to place his oldest friend, Larry Pettifer, a friendly rival since Winchester, the elite public school(as the English call it; we call them private schools), and the elite unversity, Oxford, in a job nearby.  Mind you, Pettifer was also one of the deskbound Cranmer's spies, or joes, as Le Carre calls them; he was also a double agent, working for the Russians as well.  Yet there's nobody the cold Cranmer has ever been closer to.  Suddenly, Pettifer disappears, taking with him Cranmer's young mistress Emma. (He tells Cranmer:" You stole my life, I stole your girl.")  Cranmer soon discovers that Pettifer has committed himself to a new cause, for which he's taken with him $37 million Russian that he wasn't entitled to.  Cranmer also soon realizes his former employers at the spy shop suspect him of complicity in the theft; and, what's worse, a ruthless Russsian mafia does, too.  So Cranmer goes on the run, to Paris and Russia, remembering his helpful spycraft all the way, as he looks for Pettifer and Emma, while trying to avoid the parties looking for him.  At one point Cranmer muses: "He /Pettifer/ has been goading me about my indifference to the world's agonies....I have said that I never considered myself responsible for the world's ills, not for causing them, not for curing them.  The world was in my view a jungle overrun with savages, just as it had always been.  Most of its problems were insoluble....I have said that I have always been, and would continue to be, prepared to make sacrifices for my neighbours, compatriots, and friends.  But when it came to saving barbarians from one another in countries no bigger than a letter on the map, I failed to see why I should throw myself into a burning house to rescue a dog I had never cared for in the first place."  Now,unfortunately, readers who find that speech resonant, who perhaps are even saying to themselves some variation of: "Right on, brother, couldn't say it better myself," will have a problem.  Because, for reasons never made entirely clear, Cranmer will suddenly pull a 180 in his beliefs, grab a Kalashnikov rifle, and run off to try to put the world to rights himself.  For such readers, this book might not be the best place to start reading Le Carre.  
 I loved "Diary of a Witch" and was hoping that this book would be just as good and give even more insight.  This book can not compare. It takes away Sybil's validity. She is really quite vain and arrogant,very  self absorbed,and homophobic.  It was a dissapointement and even made my  view of "Diary of a Witch" come down a notch. Much too wordy and  runs around in circles 
 I bought this camera 3 months ago and have used it a few times. Last week all of a sudden the pictures look out of focus and over-exposed. I haven't changed anything or done anything. I have no idea what's wrong with the camera, but given the price I'm pretty annoyed and Amazon.com will not refund my money because it has been over 30 days 
 For a movie that was intended to commemorate one of the darkest days in American history, I was really disappointed in the film Pearl Harbor.  As others have mentioned, the love story took up far to much of the films overly long three hour running time.  Even portions of this part of the film failed to be historically accurate.  For example, the scene with Affleck, and Beckinsale, seen standing on the painting scaffold that dangled over the side of the liner Queen Mary, as it sat, supposedly in Hawaii, late in 1941.  The Queen Mary was a British passenger liner; were on earth do the writers think this ship was in late 1941?  It sure wasn't painted in its bright peacetime colors making pleasure cruises to Hawaii.  The British by this time had been at war for two years.  The Queen Mary was, in fact, painted drab gray and carring British troops throughout the Southern Hemisphere, mainly from Austrailia to Eygpt for the battle of North Africa.  You would think the films makers would have at least tried to hide the name of the ship painted on its bow.  This is just one example on many historical goofs that occur throughout the entire film.  Do the writers and director think that everyone seeing this film is ignorant about history?  Most producers, and directors tell viewers in interviews on DVD special features that they want to get it right historically as a tribute to the heroic efforts of those who actually took part in the events being portrayed.  The producers, and Director of Titanic went the extra mile to get it as accurate as possible.  To bad the makers of this film didn't do their homework before beginning production. It's a shame, considering the money that was spent. It's said that actions speak louder than words, well, for the writers, producers, and director of this film it should be noted that the results of their actions speak louder than their intentions too.  The WW 2 veterans who saw this must have been sadly disappointed 
 Kazin in his 1942 assessment of Faulkner's writing as "incoherent and ungrammatical" is completely without merit.  Any literary scholar with a basic understanding of linguistics can see the importance of Faulkner's writing not only as a genre, but as a launching pad to further understanding of his complex and cherished characters 
 Bought this on a whim.   There are brief moments where Mr. O'Reilly traces some delicate and interesting lines.  But mostly it is turgid, directionless, navel-gazing.  Spend your money on Bach piano solo - I recommend Angela Hewitt.  
 I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long.  There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep.  avoid at all cost 
 Imposible to do so with no item received 
 If you're building a computer based trading system, this title offers some interesting insight.  There are several example trading systems that implement commonly used system features, and these systems are analyzed and commented on.  But this is far from a blueprint--the methods used are too rough to actually use as defined, and the descriptions are very confusing in many places.  Included TradeStation code is a bit easier than most to understand, but that's not saying much.  Every time I read this book, I feel like my time would be better spent reviewing Conway & Behle's "Professional Stock Trading:  System Design and Automation", which covers much of the same material but with considerably more coherance 
 The book made a huge impression on me 35 years ago. I fell in love with the story and was envious of Sam's year in the wilderness.  Last night, I found the movie for sale at a local book/music/DVD store. I vaguely remembered that My Side of the Mountain had also been a movie way back when, but I had forgotten all about it. I bought the movie and my wife and I watched it.  Ugh. This movie was a waste of time. It was poorly written, abysmally acted, and strayed so far from the book that it was virtually unrecognizable to anyone who read and loved the book.  My wife and I got the impression that the movie was adapted by someone who doesn't like hunting or killing of animals. Reference after reference was made in the movie to guns and hunters being bad, killing animals being bad and even Frightful was killed by a hunter apparently out shooting for sport. So Sam never got his deerskin outfit (as he did in the book). Instead, he bought leather gloves and wore some kind of yellow rain slicker during the winter.  At one point near the end, when Bando returned to visit, there were so many people in Sam's hollowed out tree that I could have sworn it was a magic tree, much like the magic tents in the latest Harry Potter movie. Small from the outside. But huge on the inside.  What an awful movie. Even the cinematography was horrid. If I had to watch Frightful fly around for minutes on end one more time I might have shot her myself.  Avoid this movie at all costs!  But please, do, read the book. It's one of the best children's' novels ever published 
 I happened on this book while just browsing in a bookstore and because I have enjoyed Cornwell's writing in the past, bought it without reading any reviews.  I have learned my lesson.  I was totally disappointed and felt that the story had absolutely no depth and was poorly written.  She (Cornwell) would have been better off to trash this one, as I am sure that this book will give many of her fans a real cause to pause before buying another of her books. A real waste of time and money. 
 I have some Surrender Cinema stuff and they are really good softcore. But, this DVD is not. It's completely censored, if you buy it, you're gonna miss all the good parts. It lasts only 70+min when it's supposed to last 90. Don't buy this unless you get a really uncut version 
 On the plus side, this book has nicely artistic erotic sketches and a few tasteful photos, but on the whole, unless you know nothing about sex and are starting off from scratch, you won't find much new in this book.  The book was considered hot stuff when it first came out, but let's not forget it was also still taboo to have a good heart to heart about S-E-X. This is a nice book to page through in a book store, but don't waste your money buying it 
 Moore can write -- well enough to keep the pages turning and to show that she has a brain. But I think she's squandered her talents with this book. The purported "eroticism" isn't much more than uninspired pornography, and the "thrill" is pretty much nonexistent, with an ending that is easy and not particularly surprising in the way that a good, intelligent crime/mystery is when it rises above its genre. The narrator is so detached and flat that it's hard to know or feel much about her -- and while that persona may have been Moore's attempt to reflect her ultimate ending (which I won't give away here), the end did not justify the means. I was annoyed that I had to endure a gruesome scene with no payoff, and that I wasted my time reading this book at all when I could have been reading something much more original, complex, and interesting.

 This book should be titled something like, " the decline of the gene, and good riddance too". It's really just a potted and rather one-sided historical sketch of some events in the development of genetics. The author figures these stories will help her case against the idea that that there are genes for traits which act independent of the role of the environment and in just about any environment. Since this is something no one really believes, its hard to understand what her beef with the gene really is 
 Okay...look at the cover...it should tell you one thing...take your time...as obvious as can be.  Corey, you do not have to turn your back on American Idol, we have turned our back on you.  Do not waste your money on this piece of trash.  It would be better to light a match to your money.  Weak attempt at fame and Corey's 15 minutes ran out years ago.  Did he ever really have 15 minutes 
 I have not bought the colection but reading the comics I have figured out that while it claims to be so cynical,it's actually more politically correct than funky winkerbean...if that's possible 
 After reading Blood Of Heaven I was quite eager to read Threshold.  Blood of Heaven was a book that I could not put down.  I cared a great deal about the characters  and the storyline was extremely captivating.  I was so eager to find out what was going to happen next.  I read the book in 3-4 days.  Well with Threhold I was majorly disappointed.  The storyline was interesting, however I really did not like where he took the premise.  The story was not as focused as Blood of Heaven, Myers seemed unsure of what he really wanted to do with this book.  Some of the characters were interesting, however many of them really did not interest me.  Most of the secondary characters  were not developed at all, they were just there.  Thier backgrounds and motivations were really not developed.  The main character of Brandon was somewhat interesting, however he seemed like a weak character to base a book around, Sarah was a far more interesting.  My biggest problem with the book was trying to visualize many of Brandon's visions, they become more outlandish and outright silly as the book went on.  Brandon's final confrontation at the end did absolutely nothing for me, I could not take it seriously at all.  Years ago when I used to read Stephen King he was able to make just about anything believable, no matter how bizarre and out there it may have been.  That most definately was not the case with Threshold.  Overall I found parts of the book enjoyable.  I did like the resolution and the development of Brandon's abilities.  This book really did not grab me.   I have just started Fire of Heaven, I do hope I am not disappointed with that one 
 If Dr. Carson wanted to write a critique of the emerging church, he should have gone beyond simply reading a few books and assuming that he therefore understood everything about the movement. Even the title of the book is misleading. By all accounts, Dr. Carson never bothered to even sit down and talk with anyone in the emerging church directly, despite repeated attempts by Emergent leaders to contact him and invite him to dialogue.  Tell me, how can you become conversant with the emerging church if you're not willing to actually converse with anyone in it?  As one would expect, Carson's lack of substantive research and genuine interaction results in a book that grossly misrepresents what Christians within the emerging church actually believe. He creates a straw man that reflects no actual emergent people, knocks it down and declares himself the winner without ever checking whether his opponent was a true characterization in the first place.  I heard Brian McLaren, an emergent leader critiqued pretty harshly by Carson, speak in reference to the book a while back. He said "It's really interesting to read a book about yourself that purports to tell you what you think. I made me want to do some research and find out if I really think the things he accuses me of... so I looked into it, and as it turns out, I don't."  Bottom line: Carson just get's it wrong. He doesn't have enough familiarity and personal knowledge of the emerging to give a fair assessment much less a worthwhile critique of it.  For a much fairer critique of the emerging church from an informed outsider's perspective check out "Truth And the New Kind of Christian: The Emerging Effect of Postmodernism in the Church" by R. Scott Smith. Or for a sympathetic treatment check out "Emerging Churches: Creating Christian Community in Postmodern Cultures" by Eddie Gibbs & Ryan Bolger 
 The fact that the author does not explicitly define things is a bad enough reason to stay away from this book. If you only want a light treatment of point-set topology, go for Munkres, otherwise, Hatcher 
 ALL of these discs are such poor quality that they continually freeze in any DVD player.  No wonder they're so cheap, you get what you pay for 
 It might not have been that widely reported in the press but when Disney was releasing this movie, Warner Brothers and DC Comics was up in arms over the title and direction that this so called movie on the life of George Reeves was taken, so to avoid legel difficulties, the movie was edited and it's title was changed to avoid court proceedings.  Aside from that this is a tasteless movie about the life of an actor who ment much to the generation of Superman readers who watched the TV show (the offical verdict of history is that the actor's death was a suicide and this tasteless movie does nothing to change or prove otherwise).  George Reeves should be remembered more for the part he played on film and leave his private life alone.  Case Closed 
 Sorry for the sarcastic title. I've read most of this book. I'm still reading the last chapter which is actually the most hopeful chapter. I'll start with what I liked. Harris lays out some good suggestions on handling the pyhsical aspects of a dating relationship (or courtship if you get caught up in semantics) However, Harris offers nothing else except a rudimentary courtship model that involves physical boundaries and guarding against things moving too quickly. I think this is good wisdom, but the book completely lacks in many other apects of pursuing a relationship. He talks very little about communication skills. Also you won't find much on personality traits or compatibility.  When I began a relationship with my girlfriend I read this book. I don't regret reading it, but it lacks in a lot of areas. Part of this is due to the fact that I don't know what credentials Joshua Harris has to make his claims. He is not a Phd, or a relationship or family counselor. He had two substantial romantic relationships in his life. One with the girl who inspired him to write his first book, and the other with his current wife. When it comes to relationships, I would hardly call Joshua Harris and authority on the subject. He has no more experience or wisdom that the average person who would pick his book up off the shelf. I support the crux of what Harris talks about. I respect the fact that him and his wife Shannon waited to their wedding day for their first kiss. The book is chivalrous and romantic. It is a hopeful book.  But it paints only a partial picture of how to persue a relationship. If you are into reading relationship books, just be sure this isn't your only resource. 
 I do NOT recommend that you buy this book. Dr. Taylor is very good at promoting herself and appearing on television, but I do not believe that she is better than any other dermatologist at treating the skin of people of color. She is more style than substance, I suggest that you SAVE YOUR MONEY and check this book out of the library if you have the time to read it but don't spend any money on this 
 Oh, my word, this book is simply terrible. We read it in my English class during my senior year of high school, and I absolutely hated it. I read it merely for the sake of my grade. It was difficult to visualize half the book, and the parts I did understand were just horrible. I hated how the boys shifted to such barbaric behavior on the island. And the author's writing style, no offense, was awful, with a capital "A". I sure was relieved when my class finished the book, and I made a vow to never read this book ever again, if I could help it. If you haven't read this book yet, then take my advice and stay far away from it. Don't waste your good money on such a shoddy product. 
 I have read the previous reviews and I am puzzled. I do not like this book at all. I have never written a review before but this book drove me to it. I am an experienced baker and tried two recipes following the instructions carefully.  Both failed miserably and I am not willing to waste the butter, or more importantly, the chocolate, to try another. My first attempt was the Paisely Brownies.  The recipe called for 12 ounces of butter (yes, ounces, not tablespoons).  While nervous about 3/4 of a pound of butter going into essentially a double batch of brownie batter, I forged ahead.  What I got was incredible greasy brownies with a gummy raspberry topping.  I figured the butter amount must have been a typo so I tried again with 12 TABLESPOONS of butter and while the brownies were less greasy, they were still mushy in the middle with a gummy raspberry topping.  Next I tried the Topsy Turvys (didn't even get around to making the sorbet or the pineapple topping).  Each attempt to mold the baked cookie into bowl shapes yielded greasy messes on my counter.  Perhaps I got the two dogs out of the whole bunch but as I have said before, I'm not willing to waste any more butter, chocolate, parchment paper, etc. on any of his recipes 
 This headset is uncomfortable to wear but if you heat the earpiece and bend it outwards and back it will fit just fine. You can also go to an eyewear store and have them do it for you.As for the performance it is great. I drive truck and have a lot of background noise and windows are usually down partially and everyone has no problems hearing and understanding me and I can hear them just fine also. The volume is great and at times I have to turn it down in volume. Have tried the AnycomHS-890 and this outperforms it hands down. Have had it drop my phone on occasion but never during a call where the Anycom would at any time. I would definitely  reccommend this headset to anyone in a noisy environment. Very satisified with the performance. Tried to change the rating and seems like can't do that once the review is written. Amazon needs to fix the edit system on this 
 I've read a lot of Stephen King's work, and loved most of it, but 'Firestarter' was a big letdown!  It's not quite in the 'abomination' category of 'From a Buick 8', but at least King could blame that one on his car accident. This one is probably only about as good as 'The Tommyknockers.' The premise is great, but once it gets away from 'Andy and Charlie on the run', and becomes 'The Life Story of Tom Rainbird', it goes downhill very quickly! Not to knock King too much, but as this books goes along, it seems obvious that SK was losing interest, either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason, and wanted to 'explore' the supporting characters more; or simply because this book came out fairly early in King's career, when he was known to partake of certain 'substances' which he later swore off! Worth reading only if you really want to read every SK novel. Otherwise, just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one(with the exception of the two mentioned above) surpasses 'Firestarter' 
 I hated the baby bargains book but this one is WORSE. My pediatrician gave it a hands down and his only comment was "a few authors trying to make a buck." They obviously have no research in this book because they recommend products that are not even age appropriate. These authors have little credibility in my eyes and according to other reviewers, it seems the same. I was never a bargain shopper, really, I mean who is unless you have to be! But, if I was, I don't see this book as a bargain. 
 I thought the title was interesting so I bought this book.  Wow, what a disappointment.  This is sappy and poorly written.  How does Mitch Albom keep  getting on the best sellers list 
 While this was nowhere near as bad as IMPOSSIBLE, this was just boring and very repetitive.  And the end - the storm - wasn't that in Bittersweet?  A storm on a yacht and the hero comes to claim the heroine??  I have read Danielle Steel for half my life now.....named my daughter after her....but I long for the day when I can say "She's BACK! 
 this was really just okay....i was hoping for more, unfortunately its really not very insightful. i think this is nowhere in the league of some other great books i've read on the subject recently. check out the "emyth" by Gerber, "Start it Sell it & Make a Mint" by Duran for really insightful stuff...and frankly more fun to rea 
 Taylor Dane has topped the US pop, dance and adult contemporary charts.   But the real test for blue-eyed soul is the US R&B chart. A single song that peaked at number 21?  She is just another blonde babe with a decent if indistinguishable voice (but she sure does look good in those videos, doesn't she?).  For the real goods, check out Lisa Stansfield or Teena Marie 
 I looked forward to reading "We've Had a Hundred..." with anticipation.  It is the first work by James Hillman I had chanced to read and I had been encouraged by comments about the author.  As I got into the book, the anticipation quickly diminished.  It became a chore to finish the work.  Yet I forced myself to read on and finally completed it.  I held onto slight hope that something useful and profound might be sprinkled toward the end.  My hopes were for naught.  There were a couple points of interest throughout the book, but nothing groundbreaking or "framework" altering in my experience.  I really do not get what they thought they were accomplishing.  I suppose they did challenge the status quo of therapy.  But I did not see the clear alternative they were offering in its stead.  I did not see any value in any of their criticisms and saw even less value in their proposed paradigm shifts.  I saw no practical value in their ideas - of course, Hillman may bristle at such an accusation preferring "idea" over practical considerations (see page 140).  But what is the reader to do with what has been given him by Ventura and Hillman?  Precious little is likely.  I was put off somewhat by the casual conversational tone of the work.  The book is organized into three parts: two parts dialogue and one part letter compilation.  The authors' interaction is oft times irreverent and sprinkled with profanity.  Vulgar language isn't a big deal in common vernacular, but learned men throwing the words out is a little off putting in the context (probably just my puritanical leanings, they might suggest).  The framework of the book is also a little odd considering that one of Hillman's letters emphasized the need for writing as opposed to spoken word (pages 89ff, 94ff) - this in a book that is two parts spoken word and one part written.  He actually contends that spoken word is deficient for psyche searching.  Hmm...  I wondered as I read what Michael Ventura's credentials were.  Why should I take his commentary on the state of psychology and the world seriously?  He seems to have wrestled with this question himself because he seeks to answer it in one of his letters (page 54).  The answer?  He has been in personal counseling for 10 years and seems to be "synchronistically" surrounded by psychologists.  Heck, it appears everyone he knows soon becomes a "shrink".  Certainly these things make one qualified to usher the world into a new era of psychology and therapy!  Well, on second thought, maybe not.  Much of his writing (unlike Hillman's) has an air of self-importance.  It was his sentiment I borrowed from for the heading above, "You know the changes we want are so radical; we are scratching at the beginnings of a huge new conceptual framework" (page 208).  He also wrote in a letter, "What we're tuned into, what's coming through us, is, at least in part, the beginning of the articulation of a new theoretical framework that would extend psychotherapy in particular and Western thought in general into the realms of the collective" (page 60).  And it goes on.  Pretty heady stuff.  I was reminded of conversations with college mates where we thought we would change the world.  Somehow we alone had tapped into the hidden mysteries of existence.  How simple and misguided those that have gone before us (or so we must have thought)!  Such letter writing and conversations always seem to happen late at night.  They probably should not see the light of day (at least not in a publication such as this).  Following is a list of a few of their trailblazing ideas.  1) Perhaps a child's experiences and characteristics or traits are caused by his future destiny rather than vice versa (i.e., that the experiences in childhood instead create one's destiny).  Life is lived backward so to speak.  Psychology starts off with an upside down premise by attributing who the person becomes to his childhood experiences (pages 16ff, 52ff, 68ff).  2) Individuation is not to be centered in the self but rather must take on a communal or world view.  One's psyche is linked to the world and one of the great ills is Western man's preoccupation with the individual and isolation (page 52).  The authors' premises are very societal - hence the title's emphasis on the "world" getting worse.  The world, animate and otherwise, is part of the psyche and must be embraced and respected.  One sees ecological and environmental implications throughout.  3) Pains and hurts are not to be processed.  They should instead be kept and cherished.  They give you your uniqueness and are your psyche's landscape.  They are the source and wellspring of art and creativity.  They are not sources of psychosis (page 29ff).  Embrace your "madness."  By embracing it, it will not overtake you.  Dabble in drinking, drugs, sex, spending, eating, fornicating with banana trees (page 182), etc., because these represent your true psyche.  To repress such urges is wrong and detrimental.  Legalize drugs, institute brothels, etc.  A recurring theme is the awful ramification of the West's Puritanism - maybe our greatest evil.  It is demonized for its conformity and is referred to as "white bread" society.  4) Psychology is art, not science (page 150).  Its root is poetic and found in images.  This creative psychology encourages our being rather than represses it.  Certainly more ideas are hinted at and dropped.  I am not sure that any are really fully fleshed out or explored, however.  They do not offer us a comprehensive worldview to contend with what we currently have.  I could glean no new theoretical or conceptual framework from the book.  We are just given a view or glimpse of the ramblings of a couple of men who ponder on the deep things of the psyche.  All in all, what's the point?  After reading this work I felt like saying, "Ho hum."  What difference will this book make in my life or my (or "the") world?  I think none.  My time is better spent living life forward and processing my experiences and demons.  Thanks anyway 
 Being an engineer in the aerospace industry I was highly interested in this book based on my experiences from the vantage point a "hard industry." I personally believe that it's in our long term interests to maintain a strong manufacturing base because that's the foundation of real wealth, not legal services or newswires. So this book sounded like the perfect source of information to explain our current economic situation, give an assessment of how bad or how good it really is, and suggest ways to improve it. Oh, how very, very wrong I was . . .    This book started off strong, . . . for about four pages. After that a litany of tortured logic, un-sourced assertions, facts taken completely out of context except for the author's subjectively added adjectives, Orwellian double-speak, sleight of hand arguments, flat out ridiculuos statements, contradictory assessments, and even emotional vitriol coalesced not so much into an argument for industry but one for eighteenth century mercantilism with perhaps a sprinkling of far left George Soros on top to serve as an update for the twenty first century.   Even a broken watch is correct twice a day though, so there were some good points in the book which buy it the 2 star rating. These include:   - Manufacturing provides a large source of proprietary knowledge which both improves productivity and serves as a barrier of entry, creating an industry with a large base of high paying jobs, provided it's run right. (A big if.)   - High wage nations can still compete effectively with low wage nations in manufacturing by being capital intensive.   - Americans need to save more and our education system needs to produce more engineers and technically oriented graduates.   - There is some excess in the financial services and managers of publicly traded companies take too short term a view, leading them to sell the company upriver in the long run because of a personal temporary short term gain. (i.e. Enron)    A scholarly, fair, and comprehensive book that focused on the above would be extremely interesting and useful. This is not what you'll get in this book though. Instead you'll get:  A begining section about postindustrialism, things like the internet, information technology, financial services, etc., the things that make the services based economy. In three chapters the author simply sets up straw men by taking the worst examples of post industrial advocates, instead of presenting a comprehensive picture of the post industrial argument. Not being satisfied with this he proceeds to beat the straw men, set them on fire, and piss on the smoldering remains. This is where vitriol even comes out, where he equates the post-industrialists to people incapable of even thinking. If someone has to go to this extreme to make their argument, they probably don't have one. Most telling he leaves the final assessment of the value of the internet to a feminist. To me, this would be like leaving the final assessment of how good a bicycle is to, oh, I don't know, let's say a fish.  A middle section extolls the virtues of manufacturing. This is a bunch of hand picked anectdotal stories and there's no overview of manufacturing in the world or its real impact on economies at large. This is the kind of subject that screams for reams of data, charts of GDP growth over time, pie charts of the breakdown of economies into services, manufacture, agriculture, etc. You will get none of that. There's little value except in reassuring the obvious, high wage nations CAN do manufacturing. Many of these cherry-picked anectdotal examples still don't quite dove-tail with all his claims about manufacturing though! You also know you're being left in the dark with a plethora of CYA disclaimer statments like "while Industry_X has certainly had its share of problems recently . . ." at the begining of a section.     A final section basically amounts to an attack on laissez-faire, free markets, and the concept of free trade. George Soros and a bunch of other lefties, with Pat Buchanan thrown in for "balance", should be listened to instead.   The worst part of this book is the author's lack of an ability to make any sort of coherent argument. Examples of twisted thinking abound:  - A post-industrial "industry" grows five times over in a certain period. The author then goes onto explain how this is not really real growth but something that in reality is bad. Later he proves how great a manufacturing industry is because in the same period it grows a whopping 60%! Self contradictory evaluations of the performance of services vs manufacturing is common and always falls down on the side that the manufacturing industry is far far better than the service industry even when all the standard economic indicators suggest otherwise. The author's challenge to the reader seems to be "who are you going to believe? Me, or your lying eyes?"   - He rips into American post industrial industries as being labor intensive and vulnerable to low wage nations because Americans are no smarter or more creative or more anything than laborers around the world. Later he talks about how great German manufacturing is because Germans are so much more diligent than the rest of the world's workers.   - The only facts he presents - and they are surprisingly thin and overwhelmed by mere assertions - are always modified by his subjective opinion and never put in context. When describing service industries "paltry" $50 million revenues, "only" 60,000 jobs, "disappointing" 24% of revenues from foreign sources is common. But when describing manufacturing "a very high" $6 million revenues, "a good mix" of 1,500 jobs, and similar glowing assessments are inevitable despite the number to follow. A number in and of itself means nothing. The fact the author leaves out any head on, direct comparison between industries is telling.   - Official figures are the ultimate source of information when they agree with what the author believes. When the official figures don't agree with him, he finds some loner who does and then barely explains how this time around the official figures are somehow wrong. When attacking his straw men though, he accuses them of ignoring official figures and quoting some loner.    - Gems of Orwellian double-speak sentences include examples like "Solar is already a fully competitive source of energy in remote areas that do not have grid electricity. (pg. 184)" I.e. it's competitive where there is NO competition! And "Even in Singapore, one of the freest societies in the East, the savings rate was successfully boosted by a system of forced savings . . . (pg. 229)" That's not very free if it's FORCED is it? (His defense of solar is one of the most hilariously pathetic eight pages I've ever read and really is worth the price of the book. He capstones it with the "most encouraging" observation that solar cells have gone from producing one third of the energy used to make them before they wore out - that is consuming more total energy in their manufacture than they eventually make!- to now producing three times as much energy as required to produce them before they wear out. Wow, what an achievement. Any ACTUAL power source converts many thousands of times the energy used to manufacture it before it's internal workings wear out, but whatever . . .)  - Americans are dumb and the only successful American companies basically blundered into monopolies on standards. The American economy, despite the statistics, is in bad shape. The Japanese instead are eight feet tall, can read people's minds and see through lead. The Japanese economy, despite the statistics, is in really great shape. This type of persistently biased characterization makes you question everything he claims, and eliminates any value or truth he might actually have in his arguments. The author basically can't get out of his own way.    - He always attacks opponents of his viewpoint by claiming that they don't put numbers into context, are using twisted logic, making mere assertions instead of quoting facts, etc., apparently oblivious that these are the very same tactics he himself uses!  - He claims Boeing is no longer a good company because 30% of components in a Boeing aircraft are now made abroad vs. 2% in the 1960's. This is actually because foreign manufacturing for those components happens to be better and cheaper. America isn't doing that badly in aerospace by the way. The author fails to mention that 50% of the "European" Airbus is made in America. This is an example of free trade actually distributing production to where it is most efficient.   The list goes on and on to ridiculous proportions. You'd have to buy the book to see them all because there's at least one thing an alert and critical reader can find highly questionable on each page.   All in all, this book was way off the mark and a highly squandered opportunity. It's really a mercantilist argument, and the only common thread that I could see in all the author's cloudy reasoning is that nation's should do everything in their power to export more than they import no matter what. It's NOT, unfortunately, a book about how to revitalize American manufacturing in a globalized world. 
 This book pales in comparison to the Trish and Chris Meyer books (Creating Motion Graphics with After Effects). The tutorials are redundant and don't go beyond very basic concepts. I teach After Effects at a local college, and will not be recommending this book to my students 
 Copyrighted in 2001, the Cisco CCNP library has already been rendered obsolete by Cisco themselves.  Not only exam revisions, but a fundamental structural change to the CCNP examination series has taken place in the short time since these books were put on the market.  Unfortunately, I can see no other benefit to these books beyond providing a revenue stream to Cisco.  There are better books available if one is looking for truly educational technical books rather than exam-specific guides 
 I was also discouraged by the reviews but bought it anyway. It was a lot of fun! While it worked. We experienced the same symptoms as the other reviewers here ... I appreciate the info on how to fix it but should we have to? It's too bad because it really is a cute toy and my 2 year old loved it. I would not buy it again. If you are considering purchasing this toy make sure the company has fixed it first 
 It is an interesting book for a beginner..It just needs to provide enough elaboration of the material and enough examples for that matter though! Thank you 
 I found this book quite tedious, since the author makes the fundamental mistake of thinking the subject of the book should be herself instead of her work.  There is almost no information on forensic anthropology; her descriptions of cases are very short and center mainly on how she felt about them, rather than what the actual details were.  From the cover and the blurbs I expected actual case histories; the book doesn't deliver.  The book as written would really only be interesting to people who know the author personally 
 I know this is a classic, I know it made it to Masterpiece Theater, but I just cannot grab hold of the story.  It is our book club's choice this month and I struggled to read the entire book but only made it half way through and was easily distracted by many other books.  My perception is of an old and fussy book, much like the main character. It's dense and slow and just couldn't hold me 
 I've gone through half of this book and will not be completing it.  Despite this being a "beginner" book the author quickly overwhelms the user with advanced examples while providing nearly zero explaination of what he is doing or why he is doing it.  Only the simpliest of concepts (data types, casting, etc) are discussed before getting to some of the first extremely long and extremely complex examples.  From the beginning there is no discussion of code and very little in the way of explainatory comments.  After 200 pages the author STILL has only mentioned "using" a few times and hasn't even brought up a discussion of namespaces.  Yet these items are included in every sample.  Many of the items being used are never explained, there is no step by step process that tells the reader what any particular command does or why he's using it.  My criteria for a "good" book is that by the time the author starts an example he/she should have previously explained what the purpose the example serves.  Is this an example that will re-enforce the graphic manipulation discussion of the most recent chapter?  Is this an example that will show me in practice the simple coding practices the author explained in the last 100 pages?  None of this is there.  The author jumps from talking about datatypes to using some advanced C# libraries in a sample without any explaination ever provided.  This book expects you to type in dozens of pages of code (or get it off the included CD) and learn by osmosis the point of the sample; why it works; and what the key elements/procedures are.  Maybe some people can somehow mystically connect to the authors train of thought and understand unexplained code through this method, but I am unfortunate to not be one of them.  If you really want to learn C# and are a true beginner than Petzolds Programming in the Key of C# is probably the best book I've read to this point (I have high hopes for Murach's C# but am just starting that one).  Unfortunately I haven't found any acceptable books that link C# and games programming yet that discuss the subject at a newcomer level 
 I've used CAD programs written in the 80's that are better than this.   I'll go back to Drawing Board 1.0 over this thing.  Not user friendly.   I can hardly draw a few walls without it crashing.  JUN 
 This gun is a piece of $#!& My bro got it some time ago. He was so excited. It made me glad to see that he was so gung ho about his new airsoft.   He loaded it, aimed at a 1-foot target not more than 20 feet away, sprayed as accurately as possible, and guess what happened...?  Yup, out of the 20 in the clip, about 5 or 6 hit. Not on the bull's eye, I can tell you that. The 20 shots went wayyyyyyy too fast for comfort, and the accuracy sucked like mad, but my brother's hopes were not dashed yet. (-_-)  He filled up the 110-shot mag, winded it up, aimed, and the same thing resulted, only this time, the spray lasted longer than 3.5 seconds.  OUT OF MAYBE 50 SHOTS FIRED, ABOUT 12 HIT. I checked the gun all around, but it was not defective at all, except for the part that this gun was made very cheaply.  My brother tried it on semi-auto, which is usually more accurate. Not for this gun, though. In fact, the semi-auto was even less accurate than the automatic feature!!! OUT OF 10 SHOTS, ONE OR TWO HIT! i COULDN'T TELL BECAUSE THIS GUN'S 140 FPS MADE BARELY A SOUND WHEN IT HIT THE TARGET! (We were shooting in the dark.)  Let's not even talk about the "red dot scope," or the "silencer."  I only gave it a two because (1) That is the next lowest you can give, and (2) This gun's looks is okay. Please buy a different gun off ebay or something!!! You can get an m16 with a grenade launcher with 300 fps and 300 mag cap for less than 20 bucks (if you bid correctly)!  By the time my brother had finished playing, his dopamine levels were probably under normal. In simple terms, he was disappointed 
 When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.  Neither panned out.  This book is boring.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.  Too much detail and not enough substance.  Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it 
 a very good read indeed.      and a lot of truth.     but Luther (and Calvin later) went coo coo for cocoa puffs on many of the points.         Bondage of the Will is a theological invention and a very insiduous heresy.           not known or taught in Scripture.           just drawn recklessly from by certain weak inferences from Scripture.      confusing "man's nature" with "man's will" too much.             "Bondage Of The Will" by Martin Luther (the Bible corrector and slicer.    he didn't like the books of James, Hebrews, and Revelation very much, so he'd rather they be cut out, like Juhadi's pen knife.    and he unlawfully added the word "alone" to Romans "by faith", where "alone" is found in NO Greek New Testament in the book of Romans, in the history of manuscript evidence.  ok.     well Hyper-Calvinists love and swear by Luther's book on supposed "bondage of the will.    in favor of a non-Scriptural heresy.     what about Paul's words "when I WISH OR WILL to do right, what is bad is present"???          obviously there was difference between the "will" and the "inner nature".  and 'vessels of wrath' and Luther's shallow reading of Romans 9.         Pharaoh was made that way AFTER he was showing hardened resistance to God and His people.         not before Genesis 1:1 in some philosophical "eternal decree".           by the way, you're disagreeing with most Methodists and even many Baptists, who reject hyper-Calvinism and "eternal decrees" and "irresistible grace" and "unconditional election".    that's a non-Scriptural heresy taught by Calvin.          based on his misunderstandings of Ephesians 1:4 etc. we may grant that a man is "dead in trespasses and sins" and dead spiritually.     and needs to be "regenerated".      But to say that this is true that therefore man has no free will is non-Scriptural blasphemy contrary to the Word of God, no matter WHO professes to believe it.     the teaching that "depravity" extends to all of the WILL, and therefore is "total" is what is called a Bible-rejecting un-Scriptural Satanic heresy.       ther term "freewill" is a Bible term.        the expression "unconditional election" and "irresistible grace" and "sovereign grace" are nowhere to be found in the Word of God.    nor their precise notions.      the word "freewill" is found in Ezra 7:13.     Ezra 7:16.     we find offerings "willingly offered" too.      by people in the "Old Testament" who were not even "born again"  or "chosen in Christ".     and they were all "dead in trespasses and sins".      yet they were still responsible for pleasing God  and acting of their own free will, and they had a free will.        the doctrine of "total depravity" in the Calvinistic "includes the will" sense is not to be countenanced by the serious student of the Word of God.     John 3:36 says "the wrath of God abideth upon" the one who has not believed on the Son of God.     Meaning that God's wrath is not there ONCE a person truly believes and obeys the Son of God.        so if a person is "pre-elected before Genesis 1:1" then why was God's wrath "residing" on him before that?        that's not a way to treat the "elect."       Do you think that the Lord would pour out His wrath on an unsaved man when the unsaved man could do nothing about his condition?   One question that Calvin and hyper-Calvinists (and even fans of Luther's books) could never really face and discuss and still can't is how an unsaved man can be responsible for something he is unable to do and be held accountable for something he could not have done if he had tried.     Calvin's "god" was not playing with a full deck.         his theological docrinal "god". Calvin confused "foreknowledge" with a hyper-predistination.     God predistines CLASSES of individuals, not necessarily every single peron or every single person's acts.        that would make God the biggest rapist in the universe.    cuz He then created humans to rape and pillage and murder and steal.          as "eternal decrees".       the Lord is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.  (2 Peter 3:9).    Did Peter or the Holy Spirit lie?                Now to Pharaoh and "vessels of destruction".  Romans 9:17,18.     to show my power in the earth.         did you ever read Exodus to see what that was actually about and how it applied and at what point???    John Calvin didn't.       He just took for granted that God hardened the nonelect and saved the elect and that was the end of it.       rather stupid way to do exegesis.        God had foreknowledge that Egypt would not let the Israelites go.        Exodus 3.    read it.          election is based on FOREKNOWLEDGE.          not some arbitrary thing on God's part.     What is the context of Romans 9:21??        Hath not the potter power over the clay?        there is no "clay" before Genesis 1:1.     what is the context?       THE VESSEL IS ALREADY THERE.      God saw that Pharaoh ALREADY hardened his heart, and God allowed it, and thereby continued in that sense "hardening it" for a purpose.             22:   Vessels of wrath fitted to destruction.       what fitted them for destruction???     well the "wrath" of God abides on those who ultimately don't believe in Christ.        it's based on a person's own selfish will and choices.    not some eternal "decree of reprobation."  I am not a Calvinist.      which is the equivalent of saying that I'm not ready for the looney bin.  In Calvin's and even in Luther's system, the ones who are elected to damnation couldn't be saved and couldn't believe even if they wanted to.    and not one drop of Christ's blood was shed for that person.      according to Calvin.      no "straw dummy" is being built.     that's what he taught.      I have his books.  Romans 9:16,  "So then it is not of him that willeth..."     willeth what??    Calvin never found out what  the what was.      "For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy...I will have compassion...."      but that's not referring to an unsaved sinner receiving Christ.      and by free will.       as I said, "freewill" is a Bible term and idea.     (Ezra 7:13;   7:15;   7:16;    Exodus 35:21;   35:5;  and  35:29)  and in the "Old Testament" none of them was born again or "in Christ" and yet they still could choose right or wrong, in that dispensation.  Romans 9:16, "So then it is not of him that willeth...."    THAT WILLETH WHAT??       a man cannot by act of will make God have mercy on him or make God have compassion on him.        that's what that is specifically saying.     that's not saying "well man has no free will in anything."       If you want mercy from the Almighty and compassion you are going to have to come HIS way, not your own way.      that's fairly clear from the text, if a man could read it all carefully.     in other words, you can't make up in your own mind how to be saved or right with God, but it's HIS way.      it can't be like "ok, I am determined by my own act of will that God will have mercy on me."        it can't be done that way.         it is of God.            But Calvin and hyper-Calvinists for some oddball reason believe that that verse denies the free will of man in receiving Christ, when that specific thing was not even under discussion those verses.         someone might say "Well at Calvary the Lord has mercy on a man and a man receives compassion, at Calvary."    Sure, well that's the point isn't it.        The point is that, if you want God to have mercy and compassion upon you, you can't just will His mercy upon you, on a whim;    you have to obey God's will.     And the Scriptures say that God has determined that He will have mercy and compassion on no man but a man who ultimately receives His and Messiah, as his Saviour and King.   anyway, I wrote enough on this topic for now.      Luther's book had some merits, but more errors and distortions than anything truly valid.     though most of the reviewers on this ting rave.      lol.          but I only mentioned "JWs are not Calvinists" before, IN PASSING.            I am not angry with you.       I just disagree with you and your hyper-Calvinism.             and with your mis-application of Scripture, and mis-contextualization of things.          
 I purchased this swing because we wanted something to take back and forth to our parents house. Though I am VERY sorry I purchased it. When you place the baby in the swing- the seat lays almost flat/horizontal (with the foot part of the swing MUCH higher than the head position??)Very weird?? While it swings, I am afraid my daughter could end up tipping the seat backwards and land on the floor. Also, there is no head support. On the box it says that it is age appropriate from birth to 25lbs- THIS IS NOT the case. My daughter is only 4 months old and she can hold her head- but not too great yet and there is NO HEAD support with this swing. My daughter ends up leaning way over to one side of the swing- it doesn't seem to have the support that other swings have. I have another swing the head support and positioning of the way the swing sits is MUCH BETTER. To add- the mobile is horrible. It's really pitiful and hard to believe that Fisher Price put something like that on the market. The entire swing has a poor design to it. 
 From Better Homes and Gardens, I expected a more basic approach to cooking.  This book is so busy with garish cartoons and unreadable fonts that the recipes themselves get lost.  Not all kids are video game junkies who require constant visual stimulation.  I gave the book 2 stars because, as promised, the recipes themselves appear to be good.  
 This book is a waste of money. I received it as a gift so I couldn't return it. It is full of historical mistakes and careless errors. It is not  worth taking the time to point them out 
 I was terribly disappointed with this King release.  Could a creative writing student done better?  Perhaps.   It was by far the worst published work I've ever read.  It was unreadable.  Throughout the entire first chapter I waited for a plot to be formed.  The characters were choppy and the story went nowhere.  The book seemed to be published on his name alone.  I have been disappointed in S. King  for some time now and this book really cemented my idea that he has lost his touch.  I am a long time fan, I began reading him in 8th grade and the last good book I read, written by him, was Hearts In Atlantis.  
 After making a strong case that Boxers need specialized training, there seems to be little in it  particular to the Boxer.  I wonder if this is just an edit off one of the other Barron's books.  Two, the author pushes treats as training rewards, which many believe isnt the best.  Three, on some topics, like handling aggression, the author just punts - 'consult an expert.'  Not very helpful.  All in all, I prefer the Monks of New Skeet, and "The Art of Raising a Puppy. 
 Its filled with grammatical mistakes that translate into logical fallacies.  It is extremely long winded and repetitive.  The author goes no where with the material.  I recommmend stabbing your eyes out rather than reading it 
 I love Gary Null's radio program. It's so inspirational that I bought this book hoping for more of the same. Sadly, I found it one of the worst organized books I ever seen, badly edited, and full of pages and pages of superfluous "testimonials" (literally over fifty pages of insubstantial fan letters!) I'm sorry to write this because I am a fan of Gary's and appreciate what he does on the radio but I feel compelled to warn the prospective buyer away from this book 
 I do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment. But I simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it. This is called censorship, and it gives me the creeps. As a parent, I have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children. So to realise that somebody has been cheating on me, trying to do my job so that I did not have to explain how society has evolved, how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud. this review is about the Harper collins Edition , edited by Patricia C. and Frederick L. McKissak, illustrated by Michael Hague 
 Tells you what you should be doing but doesn't tell you how to do it. He explains what the quadrants are and goes in WAY too much detail describing the different types of people in these quadrants and does not tell you how to get from the employee quadrant to the investor quadrant. Makes suggestions like start a business or develop a business system. No mention on how to do that.   I just finished reading his Yahoo Finance article "A Taste for Debt" from 10/31/06 about upcoming tough financial times and he ends the article in typical Kioysaki (no explanation or in depth advice) fashion by saying "So what do I recommend? For now, enjoy the party, don't drink too much, and stay close to the exits".  Thanks for that Robert. I can't wait to not recommend and never buy one of your books again 
 Just like Desperado.  The plot and characters are banal and predictable.  Don't waste your time 
 I wish I had read some of the reviews prior to wasting my time on this inaccurate collection of self absorbed drivel. My husband and I were fortunate enough to have lived for two years in the center of Paris. I enjoy reading everything about Paris from Alistair Horne to Patricia Wells and am always looking for new insights. This book was a big disappointment that never captured even the slightest essence of Paris. If Gopnik was a painter his palette would be limited to a tiresome grey.  
 I bought this for my pilates class and in middle of my plank my feet slid right out! Very dissatisfied, socks do not have enough elasticity to stay in place.  I much prefer the yoga socks where each toe is apart from the other. I would not recommend these for anyone 
 i tried to like this book and failed.   it's the resurrection and there is nothing else.  i think you have to take that or leave it.  i decided to take it.  linda is obviously a scholar but if you don't believe in being guided by this traditiion it it just a lot of mumble jumble nonsense which one can enjoy reading, i did somewhat, but you have to enjoy reading fiction.  i kept hoping she could cover in some detail how to reconcile a fundamental tenet to christianity and this tradition-she did not 
 I ordered this book after seeing all these reviews praising the information on growing with hydroponics and was pretty disapointed to see that there were only 8 pages dedicated to that system. Still I guess it was better than the 4 pages dedicated to growing in soil 
 Dood, he's been dead for like a thousand years, who cares how he died?  It's not like they can arrest his murderers or nething 
 Whoa! I was expecting a well-written study of the lives and perspectives of young geniuses and high-IQ adults from this New York Times journalist.  Instead, "Hothouse Kids" insults and distorts the subject and subjects of  study.   The author skewers everyone she meets: parents,"gifted" study educators  and researchers, educational product developers and competitive events  organizers, even the bright children--whom she pities for what she sees as their  their "nerdish freakiness".   A former smart girl herself, the author can't seem to find anyone likeable  in the subculture she has chosen to explore. She pokes fun at how these  people look, the clothes they wear, the cars they drive. One mother of a  brilliant child, for example, has hair "suitable for a Journey music  video." Another walks with a "jerky gait which combines a limp and a  strut". One man has "wiry clown hair", another communicates through  "swaggering body language". A gifted child's build reminds the author of  "Matt Damon on a stretching rack" (whatever that means).  Somebody has a "lazy eye", someone else rolls her eyes (which is, apparently, too "Gen X"), and a respected leader in the field of gifted education is accused of  dressing like "a mystic". One family's kitchen, where the author was  welcomed, confided in, and provided with food and drink, is criticized as "rickety--even eccentric". The meal, too, is weird, not up to the author's standards. Apparently, she finds everyone in the "hothouse" she is studying to be strange and distasteful.  Several interview subjects for this offensive book have complained of being  misquoted (see other reviews). This is not surprising as the included  quotes typically consist of odd jumbles of disconnected ideas and thoughts --as if the author had extracted sentences from lengthy interviews and strung them together out of context.   As the author of more than two dozen nonfiction books, I was shocked and  disheartened by "Hothouse Kids". It is difficult enough for writers to  persuade people to agree to interviews without such a glaring reminder of  the potential for journalistic abuse of power. The process of interviewing  requires trust: that the writer will not use the interviewees' words  against them. If I want to write a book on the subject of high-IQ children,  who in the field would gladly agree to an interview now?  Perhaps the author feels that she has exorcised some of her own disturbed memories of childhood. Unfortunately, she has added little to the study of gifted kids while hurting a number of people in the process of vindicating her own bitterness 
 First, this book is about scene, not structure.   Second, virtually every sentence is hopelessly vague.  "Structure is nothing more than a way of looking at your story material so that it's organized in a way that's both logical and dramatic."  Thanks a lot!  This statement is true, of course.  It has to be.  It's a tautology.  "Structure" and "organized" are synonyms.  This sentence would be okay, if it were clarified by what follows.  It isn't.  Every sentence is equally vague. "Structure is a process."  Wow!  Would a statement like that raise some eyebrows on the people who have spent a lifetime thinking about structure and thinking about process!   Even the discussion of scenes gives very bad advice.  "What is the pattern of a scene? ... Statement of goal.  Introduction and development of conflict.  Failure of the character to reach his goal."(p.23)  Anyone who writes scenes like this will have a slow, plodding novel.  Novel writers can learn a lot about scenes from watching movies.  And from reading books on screenwriting.   Finally, some feel that you should worry about structure AFTER you've written your novel.  This is very bad advice (except perhaps for people who have trouble getting anything down on paper at all).  Structure should be done before the first draft.  Otherwise, the seduction of the prose (one's own sacred prose) will prevent you from ever getting your novel into shape.  Besides, designing a novel can itself be a creative process.  It doesn't all have to be in the line-level writing.  Of course, if you're writing academic-literary fiction, then it doesn't matter.  The worse the structure, the better.  But for most writers, creating a good structure will make writing the first draft easier, not harder.  And you can--and should--always be willing to change the structure on the fly when a great idea comes along 
 AWFUL. Yoko Ono sounds like an angel compared to this pure cr*p. I have discharged the fool that bought this for my princess, and monthes of therapy later she still has nightmares 
 I find the subject matter of the transition between the middle ages and the renaissance as a fascinating period.  This book focuses on the life and times of John of Gaunt, prince of England and the Duke of Lancaster.  One of the most powerful English Dukes who never became King, he is indeed an interesting figure and there is much of the book that is interesting in that regard.  I found the portrayal by the author of Gaunt as a pragmatist quite convincing in the context of the turbulent times that Gaunt dominated English politics.  His flirtations with the heresies of Wycliff and the patronage of the budding English humanism you find in Chaucer contrasts sharpely with a man devoted to English institutions and the well being of the Plantagenet dynasty.  There is much to recommend in this book that I enjoyed reading.  However, I found the author's writing style labored and difficult.  Some editorial comments meant to sound witty seemed out of place and detracted rather than added to the enjoyment of the book.  There were also some sentences that needed a good editor to correct some structure problems and even correct some spelling errors.  Unsupported assertions were also rife in the book.  Most disturbing was the fact that there were some significant historical inaccuracies in the book.For example, the author mentions a daughter of Gaunt and Catherine Swynford, Margaret Beaufort, who married Edmond Tudor who was the mother of Henry VII.  A little genealogical research shows that Margaret Beaufort, the mother of Henry VII was the daughter of John Beaufort, who was the son of John "Fairborn" Beaufort who was the son of John of Gaunt.  That makes Margaret Beaufort the great grand-daughter of John of Gaunt, a two generation discrepancy.  He also lists John Duke of Bedford as a grandson correctly since he was the son of Henry IV.  However he then goes on to list Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, the Duke of Bedford's younger brother, as John of Gaunt's great-grandson.  A second pair of eyes and a good editor should have been able to detect these errors and correct them.    The writing style and editing problems detract significantly from the overall historical value of this book.  If the author had remained alive, I would have hoped he would in the future revise the book, correct the problems and perhaps add some more information about Gaunt's Beaufort children and grand-children who were so significant in the political history  of England in the 15th Century.    Some day, I hope a better writer comes along and takes the subject matter Norman Cantor addressed and presents it in a more substantial and substantiated way.   
 By the title, I was thinking this would be a humorous book about how things happen to interfere with what you want to do most as an artist, or at least how things come up when you are supposed to be working on projects. Instead, I did not find it humorous at all, it has more of a negative/cynical sense of humor. The majority of the cartoons were what excuses you can use to not create art. I'm sure someone who appreciates sarcastic or cynical humor would like it, but it wasn't for me 
 I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read.  The whole plot is just plain ridiculous.  Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime.  When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years.  Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is?  Avoid this one

 Numerous typographical errors aside, the author's self-congratulatory tone throughout should have been held in check by her editor. Some fact-checking might have been done as well. The author claims to have invented collage charms.  On her website, she claims to be the queen of collage charms.  Please.  People have been making these in one form or another since the 1980's.  Even I was making and selling very similar soldered microscope slide charms and glass glob charms in my shop in the mid 1980's, and can hardly take credit for inventing them -- they were ubiquitous even then, when the author was, according to her own bio, still selling real estate.  The book is visually pretty, but the directions for the projects are inconsistent, ranging from adequate to flippant (the collage instructions), to inadequate and downright dangerous (the soldering instructions).  Fortunately, free instructions for every technique in this book are widely available all over the internet as well as in the many good collage books and magazines available just about everywhere.  And I think most people who are going to attempt soldering for the first time will realize immediately that there are serious gaps in the soldering instructions in this book.  Let's hope so, anyway.  If you enjoy being talked down to, you will enjoy this book very much.  The author maintains a tone which indicates she believes her audience knows nothing, has nothing, and she is here to enlighten us.  She tells us to put an old, comfortable chair in our studios, for example -- what an amazing new idea! -- and takes a tone which indicates she believes her studio is nicer than anyone else's will ever be.  In her paragraph in the recent tenth anniversary issue of Somerset Studio she continues in the same vein, though the other authors cited used their space for more constructive and less self-focused purposes.  A quick look at the Pretty Organized set on Flickr should assure her that there are a great many of us with beautiful, personal, well-organized places to make art, and yes, some of us even thought to add fairy lights and comfortable seating -- long ago -- though it might not have occurred to us that this anything to write a chapter in a book about.  It's what artists have always done.  It's not a contest.   I'm not being picky here -- what's annoying is the consistent assertions and self-aggrandizing remarks and I'm-so-cute-in-my-bunny-slippers kind of thing that takes up so much space in the book which could have been put to better use.  It's the page after page accretion of these repeated off-the-wall and irrelevant remarks that becomes so irritating and makes the text pretty much unreadable after several pages of this. A good editor would have made this a much stronger book if she could have guided this apparently first-time writer into a friendlier and less self-absorbed way of writing.   Thank goodness, the rest of the collage and altered arts universe is blessedly free of this type of territory-marking, -- so far at least -- but one gets the idea that the paper arts and collage market is expanding so rapidly, that anybody with a reasonable body of work and the free time available to write a book can get it published without too much editorial review.  In all fairness to all the other writers in this field, however, it must be noted that each of the other authors writes clearly, gives generously of their very detailed instructions, and manages to write great books and magazine articles without letting their egos get in the way of the text.  The text of the book is certainly irritating, but the pictures are good eye candy. The consistent "look" of the book with its beautiful aqua color scheme is well done.  I'm just sorry I paid full price for the book at a retail bookstore.  If I'd been patient and bought it for less on Amazon, I would perhaps judge it a little less harshly, but the full retail price is an awful lot to pay to read this author's love letter to herself 
 First, the good news:  1. I lost 8 pounds in two weeks on this diet, even with the occasional skim latte and granola bar.  2. Following it wasn't logistically impossible, as some have complained. Even as very busy grad students, my roommate and I were able to stick to it by making meals in advance and marking off on a daily list the things we were supposed to eat or drink throughout the day.  3. I really liked the cranberry water, and still make it when cranberries are in season. I'm not much of a water drinker, but enjoy guzzling the cranberry water, so it helps me stay hydrated and cleansed.  Now the bad news: 1. I gained back all 8 pounds and more within the weeks following the diet, even though I eat little junk food. 2. No noticable reduction in cellulite while I was on the plan. 3. I frequently felt hungry or experienced cravings (hence the skim lattes and granola bars mentioned above). I was having fantasies of buying a loaf of crusty bread at my favorite bakery and tearing into it the minute I got into my car. Definitely not a good sign. 4. As with all diets, food and body became an obsession. Finally, two things that made this experience somewhat worthwhile: 1. I learned about cranberry water. 2. It brought me a step closer to leaving the insane world of dieting. That was three years ago. I'm not and don't ever expect to be a size 8 like I wanted at that time, but I have no regrets. 
 I havent listened to these guys since vaseline way back in the early 90's........after reading rave reviews about this album, here on amazon, i had to see what the fuss was about...  The first couple of tracks are ok.....especially the first one, that is the best song off the album....as i got further down the trackilisting, they start to all sound the same....  how about the singer, if my memory is correct, he is that crazy looking clown like idiot with huge red puffy hair.....  i think his voice is so stupid, its not even funny.....oh and the lyrics, come on now.....they are ABSOLUTELY ridiculous  If you consider yourself as one of those worm type little people, that rootes for guys like roger from the nerds.....this is your type of music... 
 Sweet Charity is a thinly veiled cover-up for the many middle and upper class people benefitting from the "hunger" scandal wherein billions of dollars that could and should be spent on poor people are  instead wasted on staff, buildings, refrigerators and trucks -- the whole  food bank and soup kitchen nine yards. When added to for-profit  agribusiness interests whose garbage is dumped into this system for tax  deductions and at taxpayers' expense, the "food"  element of the  larger poverty industry makes sense. This book won't tell you that the food  banks and soup kitchens often receive legal "kickbacks" via  tax-deducted charitable "grants" from the likes of Procter and  Gambol and other giant corporations. If you want the real scoop on another  of agribusiness' dirty secrets, read something else. If you don't mind  getting hoodwinked, go shopping 
 My partner and I bought this book in hopes that it would be a good read for our daughter in the future (she turned 8 months old today!). From what we've read of this book so far all of these stories are from children who were born into heterosexual families  with one parent coming out, whereas our daughter was conceived, born and raised with two mommies. Since the stories are all from kids who have a gay or lesbian parent our daughter will, at least, have that in common 
 Gee whiz, this is just a not so great book. The problems are much harder than the actual GRE and test abstruse stuff and your knowledge of specific equations. The review in the front I guess is sort of okay in that it lists a lot of differents equations that might be helpful. But the questions are terrible. 
 I've read all of Iris Johansen's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them--this, however was not one of them.  I found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book.  What mysterious event happened to Jock and Royd?  Who is MacDuff--well if you haven't read the previous novel, you'll never know 
 If Tess is going to continue to write books like this, she should switch her publisher to Harlequin Romance, it will give the unsuspecting buyer a "heads up."  It is not possible to describe the many short falls of this rather long boring novel without giving the romantic subplots away, let just say that the ME does no pathology as she is way too busy whining about an unatainable romance and the detective does no detecting as she is totally wrapped up in her parent's pathetic lives.  There is a bit of a mystery bouncing around in the book, but it is hardly worth wading through all those pages.  Come on Tess, you can do better than this 
 The author collected articles from a number of marketing people who are attempting to get in front of advisors. There is absolutely no depth in the content, except for the bios of the 15 or so marketing contributors. This was a big disappointment 
 The first edition of this book had several factual errors and exaggerations.  To her credit, Wolf has corrected some of these errors.  However, the main thesis of her book, and a deeply flawed one at that, has remained unchanged.  Wolf argues that having been scared by the increasing successes and power of women in the West, some men decided that the best way to put women in their rightful place is to occupy their thoughts with self-appearance and starve them.    Some concern with self-appearance is not difficult to understand.  Humans have a basic aesthetic sense and desire attractive mates.  Therefore, where one ranks on an attractiveness scale should be somewhat of a concern to many people because one realizes that others also desire attractive mates.  Women often tend to be very selective with respect to choosing a male partner, and the men whom they desire, usually having their choice of women, will naturally go after the more attractive ones.  Hence the reason many women are preoccupied with their looks...they want the best man they can obtain and know that men value beauty.  If women were less choosy about men, they would need to be far less concerned about their looks because some men will sleep with almost anything.  Surely, patriarchy cannot be blamed for making women choosy about men because most men would prefer that women have lower standards.    It is true that female high fashion models tend to be young and skinny; however, these models also tend to have multiple traits more typical of men, i.e., they tend to closely approximate the physique of adolescent boys. This should not be difficult to understand if one considers the fact that the typical high fashion designer is a male homosexual. See a newly published book in this regard: "The Nature of Homosexuality: Vindication for Homosexual Activists and the Religious Right."  For a visual comparison of haute couture models vs. glamour models, see the supporting materials for this book at amazinginfoonhomosexuals.com.    Influenced by the high status of haute couture models, several women diet unnecessarily and may also indulge in excessive exercise.  Male [...] fashion designers are to blame for this, not patriarchy.  Once you control for the influence of high fashion models-courtesy male [...] fashion designers-and fashions, the beauty industry is largely responding to a mostly innate desire among women to make themselves attractive but is not generating this desire. 
 Unfortunately, Martin Seligman's atheism permeates every page of this book making it not only offensive towards Christians like myself but wholly depressing as well.  After the first chapter or two, I couldn't take any more of his propaganda and so I skipped to the end to see what his conclusions might be.  Flatly refusing in a supernatural God who can intervene into his creation to produce miracles, Seligman's conclusion is that the natural result of evolution (which expands upon Darwin's original theory on natural selection and mutation of organisms to encompass society and institutions) will produce a perfect society free from poverty and crime that resembles "God."  This utopia being the result of "win-win" scenarios is the only "God" that Seligman believes in, and his authentic happiness is rooted in part in this optimism about mankind's future society.  Needless to say, this mumbo jumbo (based on "scientific" studies like looking at someone's picture in a high-school yearbook to predict how long they would live) not only insulted my intelligence and my faith, but it made me angry that I had paid hard earned money for this book.  I am taking it back to the store tomorrow so that Seligman and Simon & Schuster will not see a penny 
 Maybe I shouldn't be reviewing this book, but I found it so boring I could not get into it.  I found her observations about love to be trivial.  Much of the discussion makes reference to Freud (one of the biggest quacks of the 20th century) and uses an intellectual tone to try to demonstrate unfounded generalities.  Not very informative, not very interesting and not at all scientific 
 This book was sent to me in a mistake. I never ordered this book from this individual. Honestly I do not know how this mix up was caused. I am not responsible from other peoples mistakes or the mistake of your services. I do not denie buying a book from him because I did but not the Micro-Biology book. I would like to speak to some one verbally over the phone so that this can be risolved and at no expense to me. Because I did not order this book. I would like to be reemberst for the money spent to send this product back 
 Buy this if you want to purchase every book on this subject, or buy The Concierge Manual for $15 more and you won't need to look any further 
 This high chair is a lot smaller than the photograph implies.  When screwing together the sections, I managed to split the wooden bar that would be the foot rest.  Any half decent person with a jigsaw would be able to make a more sturdy toy.  This toy is very basic, the seat of the highchair is wooden with a skimpy section of cloth.  Invest in some power tools and make your own, I guarantee it would be better than this one 
 Just kidding. Actually, Massachusetts has nothing to worry about. The people in this movie have as much in common with normal humans as Martians would (an effect Fellini was deliberately going for). The only reason I rented this disc is because John Lennon once said that the Beatles' life on tour was like Fellini's Satyricon. I can only hope that the Fab Four's nights in Australia, the Philippines, and Japan were more fun than this movie. More a collection of images than anything resembling a coherent narrative, Satyricon (just how does one pronounce it anyway?) bets eveything on its visuals. Some work and are impressive, but after a half hour, even diehard film buffs will tire of watching Fellini try to top himself every five minutes. I hated Fellini's La Dolce Vita. But, being a good sport, I decided to give the famed Italian director one more shot by watching this. I don't think I want to go for strike three anytime soon. One could pretty much watch the scenes in any order. As an added annoyance, it looks like all the voices were dubbed after filming, just like they did in the spaghetti Westerns. Since there are no likable characters or interesting plot twists, one only has imagery to go on. So, let me describe the movie in montage form. We see large slabs of meat, bonfires, fat pedophiles, fat homosexuals, thin homosexuals, a beautiful slave girl with an annoying voice, an annoying poet with a beautiful voice. There are midgets, galley slaves, oily wrestling matches, a sweaty Minotaur, heads chopped off, mutilations, suicides, a man swinging from a noose, lots of froliking, little real sex and no eroticism, an earthquake, sabers, Centaurians, dusty vistas, squeaky wagons, a pasty-faced demi-god, painted woman, painted men, loin cloths, art work, and as Cosmo Kramer once said, lots of unbridled enthusiasm. What does it all add up to? Two hours and ten minutes of your time wasted. If you want great imagery in a foreign film, stick with Werner Herzog's work. 
 Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed 
 I checked this book out from my local library because Dadaism was mentioned in my Design class, and it sounded interesting.  I wanted to learn more about it.  I found this book to be very confusing and not very  informative at all.  It seems that they wrote this so abstract on purpose  (which they may have).  Although the final essay, lecture on dada, was  informative and the essay was, on poetry, was very good.  I'd recommend  this book just for those two lampistries 
 Interesting observations about rehab and kicking a bad drinking problem, so part of the book is worthwhile and inspiring.  About half way through I had to quit.  It was too much like reading the diary of a shallow teenage girl.  (Will he call me?  Did the gorgeous guy wear that tight shirt to impress me?  All I do is think about him.  Is he thinking about me? Oh, please, please, please, let him say something to me.  I love you, but I'm not in love with you.)  On and on. The humor is mildly amusing, but seems forced; it doesn't ring quite true, like the author is trying too hard.  An earlier negative reviewer said they didn't like the author.  It didn't prevent me from reading the book - I like the writing of a number of unlikable people.  But I now understand - the book is completely about this shallow person.  His struggle with alcohol is one of the few interesting/humane things about him.  His colleagues force him into rehab, which turns his life around.  He returns to work a changed and invigorated man, loving life, but continues to mock the people who saved him.  It doesn't dawn on him to thank them.  
 We used Lonely Planet guidebooks all over Europe while we were there with our kids for 7 months.  This book was the first time Lonely Planet let us down.  The book is organized badly and it was full of bad information.  Two of the restaurants that were recommended in the book (both of which sounded as if they had been there forever) were nowhere to be found.  In fact, one was a pile of rubble.  This was very frustrating when you're hungry and you're dragging four kids around the city looking for a place to eat 
  Do dogs understand language?  Do they have their own syntax and grammar?  Stanley Coren thinks so.  Or maybe, as with many of his other books, he's only pretending to believe what he says in order to pique people's interest and sell more copies...  The words we use in dog training are actually irrelevant.  Since I train dogs in Manhattan, I often find myself on an elevator with one or more dogs.  When the door closes I'll say, "What do we do on an elevator?" and they'll all sit.  This often charms and surprises the other elevator occupants who may say something like, "Look!  They understand every word you say!"    Not really.  I trained the dogs to do this by first saying "What do we do on an elevator?-we sit."  Once that pattern was established, the dogs were able to make the leap from "What do we do on an elevator?" to "Sit" quite easily.  In fact, I could have as easily trained them to do this by using nonsense words, gobbledygook, ridiculous sounds that have no meaning at all.  So it isn't my words or syntax the dogs are responding to, it's my intent, my body language, my tone of voice (all carrying emotional information), and a previously established pattern of behavior.    Stanley Coren should know this better than anyone since one of his dogs is deaf, yet still obeys him.  Why?  Because of his body language and a previously established pattern of behavior, not because the dog "understands" his words.  Coren would say that the dog understands his hand signals the same way the hearing-impaired understand sign language.  But looked at objectively it's far more likely that the dog's response to hand signals is still just part of a previously established pattern of behavior, not a linguistic or cognitive process.   Coren would still disagree.  He claims that certain vocalizations made by dogs can be grouped together, which he takes to mean that there's a kind of syntax or grammar at work.  I'm sorry, Stan, but real language doesn't operate on such a simplistic level.  And while it may seem brave and controversial of Coren (who has a degree in psychology, not linguisics or animal behavior) to disagree with Noam Chomsky about the nature of language, at this stage in the development of linguistic science that's a bit like a high school sophmore disagreeing with Sir Isaac Newton about gravity.    Look, it's fairly obvious to anyone who really understands dogs that the reason certain yips, barks, growls, etc. are sometimes used together and others aren't (which isn't always true, by the way -- it depends on the dog), is that each vocalization comes from an emotional, not a cognitive state.  In other words, certain emotions -- like fear and aggression -- may be felt by the animal simultaneously, while others -- calmness and fear -- can't be.  It's not grammar or syntax, it's emotion, pure and simple.    Even if Coren hadn't thought this through from an emotional point of view, if he'd spent any time at all studying comparative neuroanatomy he'd know that a dog's brain has no Broca's area, which makes linguistic ability totally impossible.  But as with other books he's written (his LEFT-HANDER SYNDROME was notorious for being based on false data), Coren doesn't seem to care much about the truth.    Still, I have to admit that it's hard not to buy into this myth because as human beings we're constantly explaining our feelings and experiences to ourselves through our thoughts and inner monologues, or to others through conversations, letters, etc.  As a result we're almost forced, by the way our brains work, to supply a similar linguistic medium for a dog's feelings and behaviors when no such medium or ability exists.    I trained my dog to respond in a certain way whenever I ask him a certain question.  And I have to admit, I like the way it feels when I say to him, "Do you love me?" and he wags his tail, comes over, puts his paws on my chest, and licks my nose.  Does he understand the meaning of that sentence when I say it to him?  Of course not.  But I know he understands the emotion.  It's a shame that Coren doesn't get this fundamental difference between real linguistic understanding and pure emotion, particularly when the misinformation he disseminates in this book can be detrimental to the relationship between you and your dog, a relationship that SHOULD be based on real and, quite often, wonderful emotions, not on any imaginary ability to use and understand language.    If I could I'd give this book no stars at all 
 It's summer, and my reading matter always lightens up significantly! I spotted this book at the library and figured, why not!  I know, I said never again for Danielle Steel, but the plot interested me.  How bad could it be, right?    Well, there's good news and bad news.  The good news is that the plot is different for DS, and held my interest enough so that, unlike Impossible, I actually finished it in one day.  The bad news is that this book seems entirely devoid of any attempt at editing.  The repetition is maddening. When reading becomes a chore, and you can skip entire pages and not miss anything, it's time to start some serious editing.    Here are some suggested areas of improvement:  - Shorten up the paragraphs.  They should not exceed a page! - Try spending a little more time developing the characters.  I couldn't "see" Sarah - when I read, I want to be able to clearly visualize the people and after hundreds of pages, I never had a clear vision of the main character - Pay attention to style. Every time she spelled out 30,000, I wanted to pull my hair out.  Small thing, but numbers over nine should always be written in numerals unless they are at the beginning of a sentence.  As I've written before, DS needs a good editor. This book could have been one of her best to date.  
 I've just brought and finished reading this book on 2/21/2007. I disagree/agree with some of the products she recommended for us to use! For example, I disagree with using the Leave-in conditioners which makes your hair very smelly though they help you detangle your hair easily after washing, other than that they dont help your hair get better at all! Besides, using a good conditioner weekly and rinseing it out works far better than the leave in conditioners! However, using deep conditioners should always be used with heat, so there is no way you could be roaming around your house doing the house chores, like she mentioned! I also disagree with using products with petroleum which makes your scalp itch alot, like burnt, and again they dont help your hair in any ways to get better, they are fantastic at coating only! I do agree that using oils, protien treatments and good hair conditioners helps our hair get better and healthier!    Brothers and sisters, remember most of these products are not made by ppl who knows/understand our hair! They make us believe what we should be using and we follow! Or sometimes we want to believe what we are expecting!  Overall, I knew all about the good stuff she mentioned and have disagreed with the new so called information she had given! What a waste of my money purchasing it overseas : 
 I looked forward to this book but found it sorely lacking.  My biggest gripe is that the brothers jump in a few pages from their modest upbringing to b ig shot dealers wheeling and dealing million(s) dollars items,  There is no discussion of how this jump was made, or how they could manage to finance the huge purchase prices they describe.  Further the books deals in antiques that only the top .00001 percent of the population could actually buy.  Nor is there anything about the business end of things, like how one becomes a top line dealer.  Instead of focusing on real tips and experiences acquiring items that a serious (middle class) collector could hope to acquire, they focus on items that most millionaires would find expensive.  Don't expect this book to have any relevancy to you 
 Pamela Springsteen returns in her role as Angela in the dark comedy "Sleepaway Camp III- Teenage Wasteland".  Honestly, I don't see why they just don't call this movie "Waste of your Money".  Seriously, I don't have a problem with dark comedy or comedy at all, but when I want to see a horror movie, I want to see a good scary horror movie, and you aint getting that in this "Sleepaway III".  Let's be honest people...this movie is an absolute joke and is definitely more funny than anything, but even Angela's jokes are corny.  I must admit that there are movies where the characters are so stupid, insipid or just bad people, that you want the killer to kill them.  Well, never has this been more true for me than in "Sleepaway Camp III"!!!  Honestly, I wanted Angela to kill everyone in the movie and then kill herself so it would all be over...this movie is soooo stupid!  The characters in this flick are horribly obnoxious stupid and you come away thinking that they all got what they deserved.  But, therein lies the problem...the acting is so horrendous that there really is no character to sympathize with or relate to except for Angela.    To be perfectly frank, I preferred the weird creepy and disturbed Angela in the original "Sleepaway Camp" to this dorky little happy and do goodie chic Angela that you get in Sleepaway Camp II and III.  My main problem with the sequels to these movies is that the movie has no heart as there is no elements of horror, fear, evil or dread, just dorky Angela as a girl that you seemingly would love to take home to Mom except for the fact that she kills bad teenaged kids in a rather unconvincing and absurd fashion.  Sorry, this trash just isn't for me...it's not horror, it's dark comedy if you can even call it that.  Hell, for my money, it's just rubbish folks 
 Same old mistakes as previous versions, same old clumsy ratings.  What the hell is "PG" supposed to mean?  Why are the same climbs denoted with an alpha and numerical listing???  If you do not own a copy, it is a "must have" but only because you do not have a choice! 
 The official navigation rules are something that every boater should own. If your vessel is large enough or operating in international waters, you are legally required to have it aboard and understand its contents. Regardless of whether you have to have it aboard, if you go out on the water you have to understand what the rules are and what your obligations are to avoid collisions.  Think you don't need it? Collisions are the most serious boating accident, and virtually every collision is later determined to be avoidable by later investigation, had the operators been closely following the Nav Rules.  Here's the problem, though,  if you rely on the Official Navigation Rules as your only reference: this edition of the rules is technical, and illustrated, but is often incomprehensible. The diagrams are schematic by necessity, but they are not useful if you're trying to decide what to do out in the real world. New boaters will be easily confused by the situations, since there's no perspective on what is a typical or atypical scenario. Experienced boaters will be perplexed by the eccentricities of the wording. It is not a tutorial on the rules, and as a reference is decipherable basically if you already know the rules.  So what are you to do, if you have to know the Navigation Rules? You have to own this book. And then you have to learn the rules. There are numerous other sources for the knowledge. You should have a basic seamanship reference, such as Chapman's or the Annapolis Seamanship book. You should probably also take a boating safety class at your local US Coast Guard Auxiliary or US Power Squadron, both of which cover the navigation rules. If you want to be sure about knowing the rules in detail, there are a number of self-study books (such as for Six-Pack exams) that do a much better job at going through a tutorial.  Buy this book; but to understand the basics, and to get to know the details that may save your life and your boat, make sure you extend that knowledge beyond the bare minimum.  Update: I would now recommend Charlie Wing's "One Minute Guide" to the rules of the road in addition to the official Nav Rules (ISBN 0070710945) for recreational boaters 
 As an active duty chaplain in the military I had a significant interest in chapter 9, Priests and Padres.  First, I was amazed at the number of references and her ability to read, organize, and synthesize them into a narrative.  These references, however, are derived from a significant number of ministers writings or sermons, which became the framework for her conclusions.  Furthermore, multiple references, representing several wars, are devoid of their cultural-historical context and woven into one sentence or paragraph leaving the reader to think the behavior, concept, or issue is timeless and characteristic of clergy.  I don't consider the chapter a valid historical analysis because of the limitations of the source material.  What the chapter does provide is a summary of her sources convictions and behaviors-which is not the whole story.  Since I considered her conclusions in chapter 9 highly subjective I did not read the rest of the book 
 This book is built around the idea "I wish it were true = it is true".  While this book has innate appeal to those looking for meaning in their lives, if you're looking for a firm foundation for understanding coincidences in your life (i.e. intellectual integrity), you'd be better off buying an introduction to probability 
 Need a quick lesson in intolerance for your child? Try this despicable & poorly written book. Totally inappropriate for this age group. Lacks any nuance, and deals only in hackneyed and offensive stereotypes. It is depressing that parents feel the need to indoctrinate their children in this way, at this age. I am an educator, and I am appalled 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 Being an avid penguin collector, I have many, many penguin books, but this is definitely my least favorite.  The story is about a grown-up penguin telling a group of little penguins what will happen if they do things they shouldn't.  In the meantime, one of the little penguins is doing all these things.  Even though the story the Nanny penguin tells is supposed to be exciting, I found it a little on the boring side.  I do like the pictures; they are bright and pleasant to look at.  However, the rest of the story is, in my opinion, somewhat lacking.  True, it does have a well-developed plot line, but it just did not seem very thrilling at all.  Younger children might like it, say maybe through kindergarten, but the rest would probably not 
 I like Grant Green. I always thought he was one of the four or five top jazz guitarists of his day. He deserves a true biography, rather than the immaturish writing and same old liberal rationalisms for why Mr. Green failed and died young. His career failed and he died young becauee of drugs---no one's fault but his own. 
 Reading this book reminded me of how you sometimes watch a bad movie just to see how bad it can get.  I did a lot skimming (fast forwarding) to see if it was consistent right up to the end.  It was.  Don't waste your time.  This was my first Iles book and will surely be my last 
 I registered for and received these Medela bags.  After using all 50, I got a few free Lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase.  Wow!! I will never go back to Medela.  The reason I registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don't leak.  Well this is the only good feature.  The Lansinoh bag is strong as well, easy to close (DOUBLE zip-lock Vs. Medela's bothersome twisty ties), easy to get the air out (unlike Medela's), and the Lansinoh's take-up WAY less room in the freezer! Stacking Medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape...and thawing will be difficult because I can see I'll need to watch that the milk doesn't spill out the top.  With Lansinoh I won't have to worry about that.  My medela bags haven't split in the freezer...I'll give them that.  But neither has my Lansinoh bag.  
 Alright people, Not to be overly critical.... but do you have any idea what these kids are singing about on kidzbop?  Turn off the light- Starts off with "it gets so lonely in this bed"!!!! HELLO!?!?!  Shape of my heart- "Touch me now don't bother if every second it makes me weaker"!!! Hello?!?!?!  Fallin'- "How do you give me so much pleasure"!!! Hello?!?!?  Everything you want- "But under skinned knees and the skid marks Past the places where you used to learn" (This is in reference to failed relationships, and what went wrong) Hello?!?!?!  Who let the dogs out- Is about men forcefully picking up  women at a party! Hello!?!?!  come on over- "I'm not just talkin about your sexuality, but i can't help myself when u put ur hands on me (put ur hands on me), It's paradise, when u and I, Get close, get tight ,I wanna wanna wanna, go on all nite, i wanna play that game with you baby,listen ta me"..... HELLO!?!?!?!   These are just a few of the songs; trust me, more of them are just as raunchy. Now, I admit, I havent heard the songs, I just looked at the track list and was appauled. Honestly, the vast majority of these songs are totally inappropriate for children to be listening to, let alone singing. The executives at whatever company that makes Kidzbop should be ashamed of themselves. Dont be mindless consumers and buy this CD because your kids like it. Kids tend to like alcohol and drugs too (obviously not the same age group. but you get the point.)but you wouldnt supply them with it now would you?! You are parents for a reason. Be an adult and protect your kids from the stuff they like that may not be good for them. Otherwise our nation is going to go bad real soon. There are plenty of clean musicians out there that your kids will enjoy listening to.  
 Very poor choice for a cover photo. Jason should have been a man and took off his mask. This is really a book for diehard redsox fans only. The avrage baseball fan will choke on it. Stephen king should stick to what he does best,, Horror. Maybe he should write about this Redsox season 
 Be warned, if you have a computer with a slot dvd drive, you simply cannot transfer your video files to your computer for editing, sharing, whatever.  Can't be done without a series of possibly mythical workarounds and loss of quality with each step.  I was even willing to consider buying an external dvd drive with a firewire connection and a loading tray that supported the 8 cm disks, but couldn't find one.  I searched all over, asked in several places on the apple web boards, talked to the 'geniuses' at the Apple store - this camera is simply not usable with a macintosh that has a slot drive.  Talk about crazy!  
 Other than its thin sprikling of brief anecdotes about the history of science and technology, this book is pretty much empty of content. Most of the ideas considered have been lifted from dead science fiction writers (notably Olaf Stapledon). Freeman Dyson totally caves in to organized religion, and even repeats the often-heard canard that Western Civilization would have been impossible without Christianity and the Bible. The latter thesis is patently absurd. One need only consider the contributions of the civilizations of Greece and Rome. Neither one of which, as far as I know, rested on religious beliefs erected about the bizarre spectacle of a crucified Jew who was somehow also a god 
 How are we supposed to feel at the end of this movie?  Good, that the Nigerian patients survived?  I don't think so.  The most important aspect of this story is really quite simple:  Lt. Waters disobeyed direct orders and sacrificed the lives of four SeALS.  More than $5,000,000 in assets lost because his character had an emotional crisis?  That's a steep price to pay.  In the really real world, a deserved court martial would be awaiting Lt. Waters upon his return home.  Besides all of this, the military tactics, or lack thereof, in this movie must have been 'developed' by a blind monkey.  JoJo the Idiot Circus Boy must have been the military consultant.  I can only hope that a sequel is made, with the end result being Lt. Waters hanging from a yard arm! 
 Did not like at all.  I ordered both of these CD's based on a song that I heard that was beautiful and melodic.  It was the only song on both CD's that was that way.  The other songs were more mechanical, etc.  Wish I had never purchased either CD.  Should have just got the one song off itunes 
 White is obviously a master of the subject, but he doesn't exactly write so other people can *read* what he's saying.  The format of the book -- small densely packed text -- only makes it worse.  It's the sort of book that you have to read a sentence and then translate it back into english for yourself.  Once you do that, you'll get a great understanding of how Torts have progressed from Holmes' day to the present 
 This book is good for learning about the infighting and petty disputes between the politicaly appointed and the politicaly appointed but West Point trained officers. Very informative (IF YOU WANT THE NEGATIVE) of the organisation of the Army but no information at all of battles fought with the Mexican Army. Little info   about the enlisted soldiers fighting ability or courage. Reading this book makes you wonder how we won this war. The other side must have really been incompetent. This is the most dissappointing book on military history I have ever bought. I really expected more of Teaxas A&M. the largest producer of Military officers outside of the service academies. VERY DISAPPOINTING 
 I've sat in front of this book for a week, barely making a dent in it.  Flanner purports to tell the story of French culture, but succeeds only in revealing that she is a socialite concerned only with the deaths of famous authors. The book is organized into one-paragraph snippets summarizing the latest death, of Lindbergh or Monet, for instance.  However, instead of reflecting the culture of Paris in the era, Flanner simply summarizes the lives of her subjects.  Her description of Monet ends, as do many, with a count of how many people attended his funeral. Simply put, the book reads like the journal of a socialite who is out of touch with common culture.  It is not interesting neither literarily or historically 
 I much preferred The Wharton's Book on stretching as it's practical  approach was user friendly. This book should be updated 
 "The Case for Israel" is written by the Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. Politically, he could be described as a Cold War liberal. He supports gay rights, affirmative action and OJ Simpson, while opposing Cuba and Communism. And he supports Israel. Ironically, his support for Israel is as uncritical as the attitude of the CPUSA towards the Soviet Union. Dershowitz even defends house demolitions, and have proposed that entire Palestinian villages be destroyed in retaliation for suicide bombings. Despite protestations to the contrary, he also supports torture. Yet, Dershowitz is a member of Amnesty International!   "The Case for Israel" is a piece of badly edited and completely fanaticized pro-Israeli propaganda. It was obviously written in great haste, since it contains a number of factual errors and misspellings. For instance, the author seems to think that the Philippines are a Muslim nation, and calls the notorious Spartacist League "Spartacus League". In an earlier edition, he even claimed that the phrase "Turnspeak" comes from George Orwell. (Its Newspeak, of course.) While sloppy editing like this is amusing, the main theses of the book certainly are not. Here, I will concentrate on just two of them.   First, the question of collective punishment. Dershowitz argues that all, or most, Palestinians are guilty, since they sympathize with terrorist groups or actions. Thus, even punishment of civilians is justified. There is a "continuum of civilianity", says the author, since its not always easy to distinguish civilians from combatants among the Palestinians. They are all in on it, after all.   Of course, this bizzare line of argument works both ways. Most American Jews aid and abet Israel. Would that justify a bomb in a Brooklyn shopping mold? Most Israelis support the on-going attack on Lebanon. Does that justify bombing Haifa? And what about kibbutzniks at the Syrian border or settlers at the West Bank? They are heavily armed, and some of them are illegal, making the distinction between civilians and combatants on the Jewish side hard to draw. Indeed, Osama bin-Laden justified 9/11 in exactly the same way. The American people elected the politicians responsible for attacking Iraq and supporting Israel. Therefore, they must take collective responsibility for the death of Arab civilians. (See "Messages to the World" by Osama bin-Laden, available here at Amazon.com.)   Alan Dershowitz attempts to circumvent this by claiming that the Jews who are killed by Palestinian suicide bombings are "perfectly innocent" and are killed "regardless of their political views". But most Israelis dont vote for parties demanding immidiate withdrawal from the Occupied Territories, and today most support the attack on Lebanon. By Dershowitzian logic, they are therefore not "perfectly innocent". But the opposite is true as well: Dershowitz demagogically points out that some Israelis killed by suicide bombers were teenagers. Yet, he supports the massive ethnic cleansing of Germans by the Soviet Army during the last phase of World War Two, seeing this as suitable collective punishment. Of course, these actions affected teenagers as well, including teenage girls gang raped by Soviet soldiers... By implication, Dershowitz even seems to support the nuking of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where many teenagers and kids died as well! (For the record: I support the Allies and my grandfather was a Communist partisan during the war. But that doesnt mean I have to accept Allied atrocities.)   The author of "The Case for Israel" also claims that there is a difference between intentionally killing civilians (like Hamas) and unintentionally killing them while bombing military targets (like the IDF). He also points out that Israel gives advance warning before it bombs civilian areas. Are there no bounds to the cynicism of this man? Perhaps Israel doesnt "want" to kill civilians (its bad PR, after all) but their two invasions of Lebanon clearly prove that they couldnt care less if civilians do get killed. They are, after all, all guilty, right? As for giving advance warning, the IRA gave advance warning before its attacks against civilian targets in Britain. Logically, Dershowitz should claim that the IRA and the British were morally equivalent, but of course he doesnt. Besides, there may be many reasons why civilians cant leave a targeted area even if given advance warning. Witness the hurricane Katrina in the US. Besides, why SHOULD they leave? Would American Jews "just leave" New York if given advance warning about another al-Qaeda attack? I guess so, but they would surely demand swift counter-action by Ms. Rice. And Im not talking UN resolutions.   So why do Alan Dershowitz have one standard for the Jews and a quite different one for the Arabs? This bring me to my second point. The reason, of course, is that he believes Palestine to be rightfully Jewish. And not just Palestine, but apparently Transjordan as well!   On what grounds? That Jews have an automatic right to Palestine, no matter what, is an idea that can only be "justified" religiously. But the author is a secularist. With the risk of drawing some fire, I dont belive there are any secular grounds for automatically granting the Jews Palestine, save one: the "right" or might of conquest. Before the Zionist colonization, Palestine was predominantly Arab, and had been Arab for around 1200 years. No amount of sophistry can change this fact, and Dershowitz tries some! That Jews had an independent kingdom in Palestine over 2000 years ago is irrelevant. By that logic, New York City should be given over to the Manahata Indians. Ironically, that would force its Jewish community to re-settle in Israel, something they havent been very keen on doing for the past 60 years. Presumably, Egypt should be given over to some descendant of Cleopatra, provided such could be found.   The case for Transjordan being Jewish is non-existent on secular grounds, pace Dershowitz, and flimsy even on religious grounds. Some Biblical passages suggest that everything from the Stream of Egypt to the Euphrates is rightfully Jewish. That would include both Transjordan and half of Iraq! Other Biblical passages suggest that "only" the northwestern part of Transjordan should be Jewish. But most limit the Promised Land to Palestine proper, leaving out the areas east of Jordan. The rabbinical commentary "Tevuos Haaretz" exclude both the Negev and Transjordan from Eretz Israel, but include Lebanon. "Kaftor VaFerach" also include the coast of Syria, but again, no Transjordan. The relevant maps can be found in the Stone edition of the Jewish Bible, available from this site.   So what is the real case for Israel? Frankly, the only case that could be made for it, is that Israel exists, have a powerful army, and simply wont go away. In a perfect world, Palestine would either be Arab, with the Jews forming their own state some place else, or Jews and Arabs would love each other, and hence create a bi-national state. But the Jews created their own state in Palestine, and they dont like Arabs. Welcome to the dog-eat-dog imperfect world. For pragmatic reasons of Realpolitik, compromises are called for. What the compromise must be is obvious: a two-state solution, with Israel withdrawing from the West Bank and Gaza strip, where a Palestinian state should be set up. The Palestinian refugees, unfortunately, cannot return, except perhaps to the Palestinian state. I agree with Prof. Alan Dershowitz on one point only: It was indeed a mistake for Arafat not to continue the negotiations at Camp David in 2000. However, I suspect that the road to Palestinian statehood would have been a rocky one even had he done so, since Israel would surely have demanded all kinds of "security guarantees" from such a state. Arafat isnt the only culprit here...   When I was more pro-Israeli, I wrote a more even-handed review of this book. Since then, I changed my mind. Mr. Dershowitz, I have read your book VERY CAREFULLY and only give it one star out of five!  
 I *LOVED* all of Jennifer Weiner's previous books.  As soon as I saw she had a new one out, I ordered it.  It was terrible.  A bunch of short stories, that have no beginning, middle or ending.  It was like a bunch of dis-jointed thoughts that went nowhere, and then a new "story", that was just as bad.  This book was like picking up 10 books off your bookshelf and reading a random chapter in each one.  Save your money 
 A loony segment of the far left embraces a combination of pop ecology, Darwinism (of the Dawkins variety), a Rousseauesque delusion about the nobility of primitive hunter-gatherers, some old fashioned Chicken Little apocalypticism  and a smattering of terrorism.  Mr. Jensen, a grungy neo-Luddite, promotes all of the above in his hysterical denouncement of western civilization, particularly its capitalist manifestation.  In case you hadn't already figured it out, human beings are ecological vermin. When we developed beyond the level of wandering savages we began to infringe upon the rights of salmon and spotted owls.  The planetary crisis is now so dire that we should welcome the collapse of the modern world along with a steep drop in human population.  In other words, before we kill the planet we should politely kill ourselves because, as Mr. Jensen believes, it's a zero sum game of Gaia versus us.  Mr. Jensen, who repeatedly reminds us that he was molested by his father and that he fantasizes about blowing up a damn, appears to have regressed into an infantile dreamland where he is the hippie prophet of doom condemning the West's patriarchal rationality and its cultural achievements.  The book is interesting as long as you don't take it seriously and recognize that the author is undergoing therapy by publishing his scribblings.  I gave the book two stars because I found it was amusing enough to actually finish it.  The author's style is sometimes confessional and he provides an interesting peek into the psyche of a disaffected soul who  converted his spiritual nihilism into hatered for European civilization 
 The essence of the book is "corporations behave badly".  I happen to agree but I don't need 339 pages to tell me this.  I was hoping to learn something here.  I was hoping for some history of how corporations developed.  Nothing of the kind.  Just a comparison to the gilded age (late 1800s) repeated throughout the book that is obvious to anyone who knows American history.  Those liberals who love to read long winded tirades that support their point of view may enjoy this book.  But if you aren't a liberal or if you are a liberal with a brain, this book will bore you to tears 
 To be honest, I never really had much fate in Video game adaptations. Most of them in the past have failed miserably. Here, Resident Evil Apocalyse has made it even worse. A continuation from the first so-so Resident evil film. Umberella have decided to re-open the Hive, unknowingly letting the T-Virus out throughout the city, turning the people of Racoon city into zombies. Firsts of all, I love the Resident Evil video games( especially Resident Evil 4 ). Its what gave me encouragment to see this film. Before I actually saw this film I was thinking that this might be in some way decent. To be honest, it didnt even seem in anyway related to the Resident Evil series.   When it comes to bringing these video games to the big screen you need to ask yourself, What makes the actuall game itself such a success? If you take Silent Hill for instance. Probably one of the few video game adaptations that was an actuall success. They have really taken the Silent Hill video game features into perspective and shown us how this is actually done. It actually felt like Silent Hill. But in this case, it looks like the Resident Evil video games where just thrown aside. There is absolutely nothing meaningful from the video games that was put into this film and absolutely nothing atmospheric about it that even makes it feel like Resident Evil environment. And the atmospheric soundtrack from the video games have been replaced by Heavy Metal music. It felt like an absolute joke. It seems that they didnt even take the Resident Evil video games into consideration and without it, this film lost all its perspectives and has no meaning for the Resident Evil title. This is just a pointless action sci-fi. Film makers really need to take these video game adaptions more seriously. This is an insult to the Resident Evil video game series 
  Wanting something to read on vacation, I hurriedly grabbed the Vintage paperback edition from a dusty shelf in the back of my home office.  The book had belonged to my stepson many years ago. As I thumbed through the pages, it began to fall apart.   I do not recall having to read The Sound and the Fury in college, but I knew it was famous.  Other than that, I came to the book with an open mind but expecting excellence.  To that end, I was sorely disappointed, despite some fine passages, but even those often contained unclear elements.     From the start the story came across as gibberish.  Time jumped around, and characters appeared with little or no introduction.  Gradually a sense of story began to sink in, but by then, what might have been significant in the earlier pages was already lost to me.  I wondered what connection the title had to the story.  I struggled through the entire book, finding later sections to be more coherent, particularly the last, but I was unable to gain a full appreciation of the story.  And I wasn't about to reread the book repeatedly to obtain it.   There seems to be no effort at word economy, particularly in dialogue.  There are endless rambling paragraphs and only four "chapters" for the 400 pages of text.   Worst of all, there is inadequate exposition throughout the book.  There is no introduction telling the reader how the book is constructed, most notably, that it begins with an account by an idiot.  The idea of having a family's story related by several  members if fine, so is writing in stream of conscious, but adequate exposition is needed to orient the reader.     Frustrated during the reading, I thumbed through it and discovered the appendix which described the Compson family.  Most of this material should have been presented early in the book, but even that would not have provided adequate exposition.  After reading the book, I learned that the appendix was added some time after the first edition to help the reader.  That should be a big hint that the book is lacking in exposition.  I believe that good exposition is the responsibility of a writer.   This book is more of a puzzle than a story, and the latter is sacrificed for the former.  The author does not lead you through the story; he throws you into it.  For those who marvel at the literary value of this book, I say, "The emperor has no clothes. 
 Early on the author tells how he proved to concept of "learned helplessness" through his experiments where he administered electric shocks on caged dogs until they gave up and just lay there and whimpered.  I threw the book away at that point.  This "scientist" shouldn't be rewarded for his senseless cruelty that proves nothing.  We don't support your science, Herr Doctor Seligman!  Get the book from a library if you must, but don't reward him for his "experiments."  It could have been your dog this moral idiot experimented on 
 I struggled quite a distance into this book because I love France, but finally I gave up. I found the author to be a poor writer, found her stories to be so farfetched that I decided that she was not being truthful, found her values to be very superficial, found her to be describing things that were not worth reading about--e.g., the car trip to St. Tropez, and her apparent fixation on sex--e.g., her negative descriptions of the way females dress and act in St. Tropez, and her imagings about her husband's indiscretions with the Prince's wife and his dalliance with the girls in the village. Who cares if it happened! Who cares what the author imagines about her husband! You might think her husband would care and the Prince and the Princess would care. I doubt that there even is a Prince and Princess. And if the picture of the author half in a shadows, on the book cover is an example of her professional photographer husband's work, forget it.  With the car trip to St. Tropez, I couldn't take anymore. I took the book back and got a refund 
 I had somewhat forgotten how Greg Bear wrote.  His descriptions of the  Jart are so obscure and long-winded, the reader may as well just turn the  page.  I found it annoying that Greg Bear attempted to invent even more  words in this book than Eon.  My largest complaint however resided in the  high number of typos, duplicated words, letters dropped etc that made the  reading even more disruptive.  It really looked like there had been global  replacements as the same errors were repeated.  While I'd admit that an  author is more concerned with flow, plot, and technical accuracy - the  editor should review with a little more care to the fundamentals 
 "Everything is an echo," Ilan Stavans wrote in the essay Lost in Translation. "To live is to plagiarize, to imitate, to steal." And so he does. The editorial gimmick of putting together anthologies of well-known authors under the common title 'the essential...' is usually reserved to creative writers of fiction and poetry, whose work can be somehow distilled, but Ilan Stavans is an author who has made his reputation primarily by writing about others and the editorial gimmick feels exactly like one because there is no 'essential' Stavans, only the 'echo.' I always found it disturbing to realize how ruthless and brutal Stavans has been against Latina writers, such as Ana Castillo and Sandra Cisneros (see 'Form over Content', p. 41). Stavans has been particularly dismissive of the styles conjured by Chicana writers to create their own respective worlds. The reason for such pathological fear of the language of women may be discerned in this book. Stavans' heroes are usually male writers who loom large above him--Octavio Paz, Walter Benjamin, Elias Canetti, Lionel Trilling--writers Stavans has invoked to 'explore' his own identity as a Latino-Jewish male. By his own admission, Stavans exists in the hyphen of his identity, rather than in the assertion of a self-created identity. This is why he writes so brutally against Chicana writers: because they have destroyed the paradise of hypenations, they have asserted their own identities through the difficult task of creating and molding new identities and a new language to go with it. The short stories in this book, particularly, show Stavans at his most derivative, imitating Kafka while alluding to him 
 Nothing new for the 3-D afficienado here.  First timers will be amazed.  Doesn't have the artistic advances of a 3-D Book of Angels or Henry's Gift 
 I was excited to see the book with recipes for the "14 Super Foods" after reading Steven Pratt's book, but was very disappointed.  Yes, the recipes do use the "14 Super Foods", but also use such ingredients as shortening, Cheez Whiz, and yellow cake mix - hardly healthy!  If you are interested in eating good, healthy meals made with the "14 Super Foods", don't buy this book 
 I really thought these were the cutest bumper pads, but after hearing over and over again how you shouldn't use bumper pads because of risk of suffication, I decided it wouldn't be worth the risk to put them on the crib.  I don't think there are enough ties on them to hold them securely for one, and even if there were I wouldn't be comfortable with the thought of my daughter getting her head caught up under them.  She has been able to scoot across her crib since she was a newborn so there was never an ideal time to use these.  Again, cute for the nursery set up pre-baby, but I wouldn't use afterwards 
 This is the biggest joke on the planet. No doubt, it is scary, but c'mon people. I guess it's to scare the sh*t out of you. My comment has to be the first serious review that has been made for this item.  Think about it . . . the toilet. One of the best places for germs. And you want to attach some rubber device to it. I'll do you one better, and you'll get just as good a laugh from it. (Also, it'll be a lot cheaper) Go buy a roll of Saran-Wrap. Cling it tightly to the top of the toilet bowl. Wait and watch as your guest visit the bathroom to use it. I don't think no one will die from this type of trick 
 This is not "concurrent programming".This is only "philosophy of concurrency".I think so too 
 so very boring... i gave up halfway in. i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time. my sister liked it though. 
 I ordered 2 of those which never received and seller never replies emails! Stay away not recommended 
 I cant find any place in the book where the author teaches you how to think. If the book were about, say...sex...Maxwell never gets around to teaching any practical techniques for better sex. The book is all about attitude and setting....which might make sex or thinking or whatever more enjoyable, but still fails to deliver the goods about how to do "it." The book is an infomercial about thinking. Like the one's that promise to teach you how to make a fortune playing the stock market but never quite get to the part where you learn how to do "it." The infomercial is all anecdotes and quotes, like this book. And that's okay because Maxwell uses good material.   Much of what Maxwell asserts I agree with. Amen! Candy and dinner and flowers and liquor are terrific for the right mood. Plus proximity...you need to be there! But no where does Maxwell instruct you how to score. How to get from the right friends and the right place and the right time etc, etc., etc. to "Eureka!"  But in fairness to Maxwell, I dont believe you can teach anyone to think any more than you can command a feeling or mood or orgasm to materialize. I dont believe thinking and emotions etc. are THAT auto-manipulative. I mean, some very creative people swear by drugs and booze 
 This book completely fails to realistically convey the relative risks and profit potential for the average wannabe day trader.  Im talking about someone with less than a few thousand to play the market.  Unless you have big bucks and Level II quotes forget day trading unless you are very lucky. In the trading parlance, I wish I had a short position on this book at its current price, and could cover my short at the current used price! Save your money 
 Perhaps this book is simply the self-indulgence of the authors, but in reality it shouldn't take more than half a page to explain the two reasons why soccer is a failure in this country:- 1) Money.  Soccer is a game, not a collection of commercials with some chest-beating in between - a pure sport, an actual contest. 2) Americans become fanatical during play-off season for all of the purely American "sports".  After the finals, the victors are constantly referred to by public and media alike as "World Champions", well I guess a couple of sports may offer the outside chance of a Canadian team emerging victorious.  If one were to follow soccer, there is the chance that the victor would not be an American team, and that is simply not acceptable.  So instead of reading a book searching for palatable excuses for the failure of Soccer to rise to its deserved popularity in the U.S., simply accept the truth - greed and flag waving are more important facets of democracy than peoples choice ever will be.  By the way - it's not soccer - it's FOOTBAL 
   I saw this AWFUL excuse for a movie in the theater in the Spring of 1995, and to this day I consider it one of the WORST movies I have ever seen (to date) and an ABSOLUTE waste of the cost of the ticket.     I don't even remember now (it being over a decade later) why I even went to see it.     But I do remember how stupid and boring it was and how I kept dozing off throughout this sorry excuse for a film.      Looking at some of the other reviews I can see that there are others who consider Johnny Mnemonic one of Keanu Reeves's biggest flops.      I like Keanu Reeves, but he should br embarrassed for being part of such a waste of people's money and time!     If I could give this movie NO STARS, or NEGATIVE STARS, I would. But I can't on this site, so I'm giving it 1 star, though it deserves much less!  1 STAR!!!!!! 
 Even though this book is inexpensive, I wouldn't recommend purchasing it. The job ideas are not inspiring, and not really up to date either. It barely skims the surface of what someone can do with an English major and/or writing experience, and never steps outside of the basic areas that you've probably already thought of yourself. It also doesn't give you a single idea as to how to break into any of the few jobs it mentions, if you happen to be looking for that kind of advice as well. Purchase something a little weightier and a little more expensive, it'll be worth it. This isn't 
 Ive read reviews for this piece of schlock calling it a "  cult classic" ( isnt that  what they always call crappy movies that only stoned college kids can watch? )  or "underated" (theres a reason  it was underated -IT SUCKS). Brad Pitts performance was laughable. Watch any episode of Gunsmoke and tell me Early Grace wasnt a bad impersonation of Festus from start to finish. And that guy from the X Files ,David sumthin or other, mumbles in this annoying monotone throughout the whole film. This guy adds about as much to the movie as those ads for the concession stand.And Juliet Lewis playing a  yet another brain dead bimbo. Who woulda saw THAT one coming??? The only reason I gave this one 2 stars is its so bad it just kept me on the edge of my seat. I think its called " morbid fascination", like when you stop to gawk at a really bad traffic accident - it repulses you but you just cant turn away. If you want my advice ( and you probably dont) take the money you were gonna spend on this movie and go buy a Gunsmoke DVD. That way you get Festus AND you get to watch Matt Dillon beat the h*** outta somebody 
 Yeech!  Is this what all the ridiculous hype is about?  Give me a break.  As another reviewer noted, the production is thin and tinny and there is no groove whatsoever.  Also, as best I can tell, musical ineptitude by Wareham et al has been sorely mistaken for minimalistic 'genius' by sycophantic dweebs to help declare themselves as so very 'different' from the masses. But  "different" anything is neither here nor there if the music is uninteresting and poorly performed, and this is about as dull as it gets. This sort of ethereal, nouveau-Velvet Underground stuff has been done zillions of times better by other groups, such as Dream Syndicate or Yo Lo Tengo, who can actually play their instruments.  If these guys are flying your banner for you, great but I find it a very dull, solitary shade of gray.  So,if you want a good example of how not to write and perform ethereal-noise-pop, buy this CD immediately.  Otherwise, entirely forget this group and buy just about anything by Yo Lo Tengo 
 I was excited when I first saw this - looked like new music from the trio with Mehldau's original drummer. But it turns out to be series of leftovers, outtakes, "songs" that didn't make the cut in earlier albums, I guess from an earlier, now defunct trio.    The first track has a shimmering mirage like quality but the rest start interesting and rapidly go downhill -vapid, noisy, pointless and self-indulgent. And with an almost maniacal performance tendency Mehldau has gone to lately, repeating the same musical passage over and over as if something new will pop out of it through repetition. It's sad, I used to think that the earlier more lyrical, emotional Brad Mehldau, et al, were the best thing out there. Look to his various Art of the Trio albums, or Anything Goes for much more involving music.  I keep waiting for the obviously talented Mr Mehldau to put his heart back in his playing, instead of flashy technique...    Caveat Emptor. Let the buyer beware. Definately audition before purchase.  Don't blame me, I'm just trying to save your money. I've always felt anyone can write an unreflective good review, including the artist himself, the record label and his friends. That's why there are so many of them. But if someone takes the time to write a negative one, to tell you why an album is not worth buying, they probably care for your money. I always read those first.   
 The subtitle; "Glenn Hammond Curtiss and the Race to Invent the Airplane", says much about the book.  Curtiss had nothing to do with the invention of the airplane.  Instead, the author vigorously argues in favor of Curtiss and the AEA (Aerial Experiment Association) as they blithely tried everything they could think of to steal, ignore, circumvent, or otherwise discredit the Wright's achievement.  Their most odious act was the reconstruction of the Langley aerodrome, with the connivance of the Smithsonian, which has managed to so distort the historical record it is still fooling people today.  This book carries their torch into the 21st Century.  The AEA would be proud.  For those of you reading these reviews, what the Wrights discovered/invented was not the Curtiss lawyer's narrow focus on wing-warping versus ailerons, but full three-axis control plus propulsion.  Find an aircraft designer today who thinks those items are "obsolete" 
 Pat Barker's DOUBLE VISION resolves perfectly the beery "brew-haha" of Miller Lite's immortal bar argument:  "Tastes great!  Less filling!"  In this oh-so-faint cousin to English pastoral novels of George Eliot, Jane Austen, and Thomas Hardy, Pat Barker has crafted a writerly but irrelevant novel filled with characterless characters, too-improbable plot contrivances, and pop philosophical conundrums supposedly arising from the great (and noticeably non-Asian, non-African) horrors of the last decade - Afghanistan, Kosovo, and 9/11.   The novel begins with the heroine, Kate Frobisher, suffering a temporarily debilitating auto accident on an icy country road.  Kate is a sculptress, recently commissioned to create a fifteen-foot statue of (who else?) Christ.  Her late husband Ben has recently died in Afghanistan, working there as a war photographer, and now Ben's partner and boozy friend Stephen arrives to incorporate Ben's work into a book about war and its observers and the meaning of recording such events while not participating (far, far, far better treated in the DVD "War Photographer" about James Nachtwey).    Remarkably, Stephen's brother Robert lives close by to Kate, and although Stephen falls for Kate, he falls even harder for Robert's 19-year-old babysitter, Justine (so exotically French!), the only child of the local (and badly divorced) vicar, Alec, who happens to take in ex-cons, one of whom, Peter, becomes Kate's temporary arms and legs in the art studio while she recovers from her accident.  Got all that?  Add in Robert's son Adam, who suffers from Asperger's Syndrome and Peter's Zelig-like personality and surprise criminal past, all shadowed by that indomitable 15-foot Christ statue, and the result is "another fine mess" as Oliver Hardy used to say.  Barker's style is reservedly British, but her prose is observant and at times compelling if you can look past such Anglicisms as kerb (curb), poofs (gays), and fug ("a fug of warmth and music", "a fug of human bodies and damp wool").  She spins a convoluted web of strained family relationships among Robert's and Stephen's family, and between Stephen, Justine, and Alec, and their impact on one other plays at times like a multi-themed concerto.    Unfortunately, the interjections of BIG IDEAS about war, media, the role of the correspondent/photographer, Goya's representations of war, the fragility of life and our perpetual exposure to random violence and tragedy, even in the English countryside, reduce a novel of manners to Novel Lite.  Nice prose, but too many big ideas too easily tossed off and unexamined, requiring too many plot manipulations to accommodate their presence (or force their presence in the first place).  In the end, after all the dancing around horrific war images of rape and death, sniper bullets through the skull, and 9/11 catastrophes, we're left with Stephen's stunningly banal observation, "No experience is valid without the accompanying image." This philosophical gem presents itself just before a day cruise almost turned Titanic reminds us again about life's ever-threatening tragedies.    In the end, DOUBLE VISION feels more like a gentrified, exurb-London version of CLAN OF THE CAVE BEARS, full of grunts and head-clubbings (literal and figurative, that is) within an artsy, cloistered-almost-to-incestuousness, gossipy, adulterous, self-consciously angst-ridden clan of urban (and faultlessly urbane) transplants.  Only Mrs. Peel and Mr. Steed are missing to complete the tableaux.    For those seeking this kind of countryside "slice of life" with a little intrigue, I recommend the more compelling and considerably more artistically satisfying alternatives of Graham Swift's WATERLAND and EVER AFTER and Robertson Davies' THE DEPTFORD TRILOGY.  
 In the original film the seven were played by seven top-notch actors..even Brad Dexter,the most colorless of the original seven was head and shoulders above this new bunch...Oh,yeah,Yul Brynner replays his role as the leader,but the other two surviving members from the original film are played by new,and inferior actors.."Vin"the role that helpled make actor Steve McQueen's reputation,is taken over by Robert Fuller,the scout on the old"Wagon Train" teevee show..While McQueen started out on teevee himself(In "Wanted-Dead or Alive"),he had that "something" which Fuller lacks.."Chico"the half-breed mexican,who also survived the first film's shoot-out was played in that film by Horst Buchholtz..in this film the charismatic Buchholtz has been replaced by the colorless Julian Mateos..Claude Akins and Warren Oates try to fill out roles played better by James Coburn and Charles Bronson...Another thing that first film had going for it was Eli Wallach as the bad guy.. ,the bad guy in this film is about as menacing as a housefly,which tends to make the whole film seem a total waste of time.. 
 Yes the book is fairly easy to follow, but the tutorials ask you to perform tasks that are not possible with the supplied software.   Don't waste your time trying to learn from this book unless it is required for a class!  Besides VB6.0 has reached the end of the support life cycle, and it doesnt run on xp 64bit 
 I opened this product and started reading the manual the same day I received this product. I had trouble operating the operating valve and getting it to work correctly. To Fagor's credit, when I called technical service, they called me back the next day. However, the tech curtly said I didn't know how to operate the product and didn't read the manual. After I hung up, I re-read the manual and still couldn't find the help I needed. Annoyed, I spent 15 minutes trying to call them back, only to be put in an eternal loop trying to get through their system to reach tech support again. I wasn't able to get ahold of them, or leave a message, after 15 minutes. I returned the product. I wouldn't buy anything from Fagor. If you're going to buy a pressure cooker, buy it from someone else with better tech support. I've bought many kitchen products via Amazon, and never encountered the uselessness that equates tech support at Fagor 
 as someone said in an earlier review, the movie is split up into two parts.  the first part, training camp, was good. i enjoyed the movie up until it switches to vietnam.  after that, i found it unwatchable. the main character is so annoying, i kept hoping he would get shot instead of his supporting cast. if you're looking for a good war movie, look elsewhere. 
 This review is only on the packaging. The packaging looks very nice, it is a 10" size red velvet box, a bit smaller than a LP. The big problem is that inside the CDs are placed next to each other (two in the top, two in the bottom). As a result, the chances that they get dislodged during transport are high: I got two copies of it and in both cases, all four CDs were dislodged and consequently scratched.   The difference between this edition and the non-limited edition (ASIN: B000F5GKP4) is the fourth disc with unmixed songs. If this is the reason you plan on buying this edition, you can find most of the songs in their unmixed full length versions either on the GU 10 (unmixed) version (ASIN: B000GPI3BC) or on the artists' albums.  I do not recommend this item, the rating of 1 star is based on the state in which it is unfortunately likely to be received, that is, damaged 
 This is the second (and definitely last) book  I  bought from Dan Margulis ( "the experts' expert " ?) The man has certainly some talents. For example the talent to write a complete book around just one (good) idea. As one or two other reviewers mentioned this book can be summarized in say 10 pages. The rest is just making simple things complicated to fill a book. I get the impression that some authors of photoshop books praise each other's work just  to mutually boost sales 
 Difficult to belive--so much bad Bukowski.  And all in one place 
 It is unfortunate this book didn't come out better. Some glaring problems with it include: - has no concept of energy physics to begin with - does not understand "hydrogen economy" (hydrogen's an expensive storage, not a source of energy) - downplays geological data of oil discovery (or doesn't understand it), although Hubbert is covered briefly - believes or disseminates half-baked unproven ideas from the research sector: scientifically not valid energy sources are brought forward as alternative fuels - does not deal with the net energy concept (EROEI) or even refer to it  With these fundamental oversights it's really difficult to recommend the book.  It's not completely without merit as it does tell some of the basics right, but mostly it's pathologically impartial journalistic fluff, without looking at the hard facts as a good researcher should.   It's too much about how we are miraculously going to replace oil, gas and coal with tar sands, nuclear power, hydrogen and live happily ever after.  To those readers who want to believe this, this might be a good book. People looking for valid and scientifically solid reasoning on the subject will be sorely disappointed.  I'd recommend books by Deffeyes, Simmons, Heinberg, Campbell and many others before this (all on peak oil) 
 I love George Gershwin tunes.   But, after listening to the first cut on disk one entitled "Prelude No.2 For Piano," my first thought was:  "You've got to be kidding, couldn't the engineers have reduced the "hiss" noise from this great collection."   Unfortunately, the problem was with my equipment. Once corrected, this CD was well worth the money spent. My vote goes from two stars to Five Stars 
 The collection of stories in this anthology are pitiful not horrific.  This book opens with 90 pages of an intro that provides a chronology of "events" for the genre for the year.  An absolute waste of paper and ink.  Neither interesting nor relevant to a good horror story.  Finally the book opens with the first of "The Best New Horror", a triffling werewolf story that left me wanting.  Better stories are told by 6-year olds.  But I had faith and kept reading and was further disappointed by the quality of the stories that followed.  Don't waste your time, your money or your shelf space.  This book is not worth any of them 
 These things are just plain disgusting. If you are ever in need of emegency rope, get these, but otherwise I doubt they are fit for human consumption. It feels and tastes like eating soft plastic, and I would hate to think what they do to your insides. I have battled to even give some of these away, so they ended up in the trash can, where they rightfully belong 
 I thought this book was going to be a great Legal Thriller, but little did I know that it would turn out to be the worst book I have ever read. I expected a lot more out of Scott Turow, who wrote "One L", which I loved, but this book was plan boring. The begining started out slow and it never picked up from there! The worst Legal Thriller, ever 
 At first I didn't realize that you have to use Amazon's software to load onto the Zen.  Once I figured that out (actually my husband figured that out) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do.  I wasn't able to edit the stars.  If I could I would give this 5 stars.  If you have tried some other sites for the Zen, they are much more difficult to use. Amazon's Unbox is great for the Zen 
 You HAVE to use their lousy SonicStage software to transfer songs to it. That is just stupid. Well, not just stupid, arrogant also.  I was attracted to this thing becasue of it's size, battery life (which is exaggerated by at least 50%), radio tuner, and most of all its support of AAC encoded files. Apple's products have no radio tuners, and if you've chosen AAC as your audio codec, you haven't been able to get a flash based player which will both play the radio and play your AAC files.  Kudos to Sony for allowing it to play AAC audio files, it's about time someone besides Apple implemented this MPEG standardized codec in their "MP3" players, but why force poorly written software (SonicStage) down our throats? Why force any software down our throats? With almost all flash based mp3 players you can just drag and drop your music files via your operating system; you just connect it as an external hard drive and drag and drop. Then also you can use them from Windows, Macs, Linux, whatever.  And why are they still pushing ATRAC codecs? It's a waste of their time and money, and the world does not need Sony trying to push its own proprietary codecs. It's by no means superior to the standardized MPEG AAC codec or Microsoft's proprietary (although basically free) WMA codecs. Dear Sony, your codec is not significant, it is not a player in the audio codec world, and the world is better off without you trying to push it on us. The same can be said about your other proprietary variations on standardized technologies, e.g. betamax and Memory Sticks. You just make the world more complicated, in the end you lose, and your market share goes to zero. (Although I did think MiniDiscs were a good idea.)  It's a good piece of hardware, but in order to use it you have to jump through Sony's hoops. Just say no. 
 A boy and his father build a cabin in the wilderness.  The boy is left alone at the cabin to prepare it for the family.  Meanwhile father returns to civilization to collect the rest of the family, which includes younger siblings, Mom, and a new baby.  Father doesn't return and boy starts to worry about how he will take care of himself - clothing, food, etc. if father never returns.  An Indian mentor enters the picture and teaches the boy how to set snares to catch rabbits and other important living sustaining skills.  Boy ends up alone for the most part throughout the winter with an occasional visit from his Indian friend.  Father finally returns with family in spring.  Seems the family was sick when he returned home to get them and then he got sick.  The family is amazed with how well the cabin looks and how how the boy fended for himself.  Does this sound great to you?  Then go read  "The Sign of the Beaver," a Newbery Honor Book written by Elizabeth George Speare in 1983.  Speare's other fine works of historical fiction for youth include "The Bronze Bow" and "The Witch of Blackbird Pond" both winners of the Newbery Medal.  This book is very well written but I cannot in good conscience rate it higher than a "1" because it is a blatant ripoff of Speare's wonderful book. The only major difference is that in Van Leeuwen's book, two boys are left alone at the cabin instead of one.  Everything else in the the synopsis above is identical in the two books.  Van Leeuwen could have at least acknowledged Speare's work by including the statement: "inspired by ... 
 This book attempts to cover the amount of theory that would require a shelf of books to cover adequately.  As a result, it basically only gives the definitions and results (theorems without proofs) in each topic, something that one could get for free from online encyclopedias.  There are problems with partial solutions, but they are not problems that a student who is exposed to the topics for the first time can solve.  Since there are no proofs of theorems or examples, one cannot solve those problems from studying from this book alone, so why even put those problems in?  To me this seems like a book that the author wrote to summarize the author's knowledge (if the author has really indeed memorized this plethora of information???), while there is no way of understanding what the topics are about if you are reading the topics for the very first time.  To master all the topics in this book would require years of serious studying, so you are better off buy books that specialize in these topics 
 This really is not a book on Hacking Tivo, rather a book on "Hacking First Generation Tivo's."  I have a series 2 DVR and expected to see some hacks that would prove worthwhile for my DVR, however there is little for owners of Tivos manufactured in the last two years.  Very simple recommendation-if you have a first generation Tivo buy the book, otherwise pass 
 My unit failed after one day of use (never even got to the field.) Plugged it in to charge it overnight and next day only the blue LED would come on but could no longer connect. Bluetooth connections can be tricky and the paper manual provided is worthless. The on-CD manual better but is still way too spartan for a device like this.  I liked the standard mini-USB cable connection for the charger (similar feature on my RAZR) but I found it vexing that you couldn't use that same cable for data (it appears to be a standard cable) but instead have to buy a "special" cable for using the data port. They give you the mobile AND AC charger but the omission of a data cable seems odd. Other units using Bluetooth and USB (such as the 4-in-1 by Wintec) provide this. I found a LOT of complaints and kudos for this unit surfing for solutions to my issues so it appears that their are some quality control problems in the manufacturing. Folks with working units seem to love them. If you get one with the bad solder connections, you are disappointed 
 I thought the pricing for this item and the quality delivered were sub-par.  "Extra Large" to me meant a lot of sheets on the tablet.  The tablets were skimpy and the paper of the poorest newsprint quality.  I would not purchase this item again 
 I will not be passing it on to a friend.  The ending left me irritated; why should I close a book with questions in my head?  I will not buy another Picoult book.  I felt "snookered" by Keeping Faith and now I have been fooled twice.  I have to say I did enjoy the book up until the ending, but the Hannah ghost plot was unfulfilled and I was surprised to find out in the middle of the book that Ellie had short hair.  Why didn't I know that before?  Obviously, the characters would have benefited from better descriptions.  
 Yet another of-the-left anti-free market anti-business rant by a second rate 'scientist' that few people take seriously these days. Suzuki should keep to his last.  Still, if you're already persuaded to his viewpoint -- a  fellow traveller -- this book is a beauty 
 I chose this book after reading the glowing reviews here at Amazon, hoping to use it as an introductory tutorial to XML. I was disappointed!   The writing style chosen by the author is terse, as if writing space is at a premium - and this for a book which is 600+ pages long. The examples are badly chosen in my opinion, and the explanation of basic concepts is presented in the style of a reference manual. Take for example the explanation of the NOTATION element attribute: "A notation type attribute contains the name of a notation declared in the document's DTD... In theory, it could be used to associate types with particular elements, as well as limiting the types associated with the elements".   At this stage, I gave up on this book and went instead to Hunter's "Beginning XML". Still, all wasn't lost: I read a colleague's copy, so at least I wasn't out of pocket 
 There is much ado about nothing in a good part of this book. Thomson has a habit of vast illuminations of celebrities that nobody has ever heard of, while ignoring many acknowledged and well regarded stars, especially the American ones. I bought his first book, which though well written, annoyed me in its cynical certainties, voiced by an author who apparently thinks he is an absolute genius and among the most sagacious critics. I bought his second edition of the same book, hoping that he would include celebs whom he ignored in the first edition. He included a few more in the second edition, and expanded on earlier assessments, most notably of the actor Robert Ryan, on whom he lavished well deserved praise. However, Thomson continued to ignore stars, Barry Sullivan, Vic Morrow, allotted about one hundred words to Dan Duryea. I saw a lot of damning with faint praise. He criticized Frederic March, Robert Wise, John Frankenheimer, and so on. I would not consider buying the third edition because Thomson is just so full of himself that it nauseates me 
 I'm rather upset with the technical quality of this DVD.  Grindhouse rereleased this disc exactly as it was in 2000, without so much as a 16x9 animorphic upgrade.  This is certainly not worth the $20+ dollar price tag Amazon.com has right now 
 This man obviously knows nothing about human behavior. Most people know that just because someone can't hold your eye contact does not mean that they are being dishonest. In more cases than not, they simply have low self-esteem are very self-conscious, and are thinking about themselves constantly in social interactions just like you or I might do when asked to do improv. This man himself is a manipulator, and a liar. He's manipulating you to get this book,  taking advantage of those who refuse to learn how to read people from experience. Lying and "hypnotizing" people in order to get the truth out of them, is far less effective than being honest yourself. If you are honest you will recognize honesty and you will recognize liars. You will start to have an understanding of people's energies if you just pay attention 
 The book starts out very badly. It is very hard to understand what is happening.once it gets into the action it gets a little better. As you go on it gets better and better. The end is really really bad. It didnt really relate to the rest of the story                  kenny101          p.s. dont listen to ashrey pinke 
 Much too stereotypical for my tastes and the storyline is not only unbelievable- it drags on and on. Sadly, from reading some of the reviews on Amazon, Mr. Hiassen's stereotypical, over the top books on the people of Florida are read by many as real and some reviewers state that they want to visit Florida after reading Mr. Hiaasen's books. This is sad- that  people actually believe that the state is chock full of characters like Twilly Spree, Clinton Skink Tyree and Palmer Stoat. Where does he get these names? During my 25 years in Florida, the people I met  had names like Robert, Jim, Mary, Chris, Michael, etc. By the way, for those of you who think I am just a Floridian with sour grapes- I have been a proud resident of the Northeast for over 20 years. I just dislike stereotyping of groups of people. It causes prejeudice, misunderstanding and in extreme cases- hatred. Read some Christopher Moore for your humor fix. He doesn't stereotype and although his stories are over the top in his own way, he makes them believable and fun 
 This movie had some strange problems at the menu level and at the end of the playback. Sometimes there was a dark screen at the beginning, also it was not possible to start the movie using some of the menu links. At the very end playback became jumpy. All those problems are probably an effect of faulty manufacturing,  surface of this DVD doesn't look perfect. 
 I bought this book when I decided to start a container garden on my deck.  I returned it the moment I got it.  It just didn't have what I was looking for.  Although it has some stuff that is pretty to look at it didn't  provide the instruction that I wanted and needed.  I wasn't impressed in  the least. I found a book that outshines this one in every way.  It's David  Joyce's Complete Container Garden.  A huge book with wonderful ideas and  photographs.  The best part is that it gives step by step instructions on  how to duplicate A LOT of the arrangements.  I am very proud of my new deck  and it is because of that book.  I learned a lot.  It has all of the info a  beginner would need yet it is interesting enough for someone who has  gardened forever.  Potted Gardens, by Rebecca Cole can't compare 
 You truly get what you pay for. What more can I say 
 With the great business that has been flourishing to serve curiosity for Islam (read: hate for Islam) after 9/11 - this author joins the gold rush. Not only that he couldn't confirm with any evidence of document or other to Al-ahram newspaper that he has been affiliate of Alazhar universitie and earned a degree in Islamic studies there. But the book has many fallacies that can never be the outcomes of a person who studied Islam. I aticipate that the book will follow the destiny  of Norma khouri's book "Forbidden Love, A Harrowing True Story of Love and Revenge in Jordan ". The ethnic aspirations of the author are clear in his tone when speaking about the injustices that are done to his people - the Copts 
 I was looking for house plans that had the major rooms on the front of the house overlooking a view.  The title led me to believe I would find that type of home in this book.  I did not.  Also, most of the plans were very complicated with multiple roof angles and expensive building items 
 This book really wasn't for me.  It's the same tripe as 101 other books of the genre.  Although, it might be useful to the right person.  I'd happily recommend it as a gift for a teenager, or anyone who doesn't usually read books.  The book reads a lot like the "Chicken Soup for the Soul" series, with quirky quotes and anecdotes, but very little substance.  On the bright side, after reading Chomsky or Neitzche, McWilliams is a comic relief 
 This book is same story as last, except the names have changed. This book is horrible, will not buy another in this series. Save your money. 
 This is the first Grafton book I've read, but I'm pretty sure it will be my last.  Simply put, this is the worst book I've read in the past year.  The plot is ridiculous: it centers around the murder of woman who is prostitute/porn star/water treatment plant worker.  The characters only exist as canned responses to the investigator's questions.  Critical clue are revealed in predictable fashion to achieve an utterly anti-climactic ending devoid of any epiphanies or suspense.  
 You'd expect a book with this title to actually have some neurobiology in it, but you'd be disappointed. This slim volume consists of two diffuse philosophical essays, one about free will, and the other about political power. Both are simplistic, in my view, and don't bring any new ideas to the table. The essay on free will was the most interesting, but despite the book's title, the author doesn't bring in any neurobiology. Instead he basically says that neurobiology should be involved, and possibly quantum mechanical randomness, because that's the only nondeterministic mechanism he can think of that might be related to the nondeterminism of free will. That particular idea is explored much more deeply in Roger Penrose's book "The Emperor's New Mind," which despite its flaws, is a much deeper and more solid book. 
 Best Song:  Moving Oleta Worst SOng:  Secret Biggest Let Down:  I'm Gonna Climb That Mountain and Sky Full of Angels.  (Patty Loveless could have done wonders with these!) Other Good Songs:  If I Had Any Sense Left At All; Room to Breathe; He Gets that From Me; Once You've Learned to Be Lonely; Forgettable:  Love Revival; Somebody; O.K. - The Duet with Vince Gill which made such an impression on me that I can't even remember the name of the tune.    The CD is way overproduced just like Reba's normal fare.  But the material here isn't half bad.  "Moving Oleta" should have been released as the single and should be winning awards for "Song of the Year".  By far one of Reba's most moving performances!  
 While the appeal of the 'oxford' name and the attractive price/page ratio make this book seem like a good deal, I found it extremely difficult to get any useful information out of this book.  The authors give their opinions  on subjects, before (or in many cases, in place of) giving any coherent  summary of it.  Just for example, try to figure out who Draco was.  If you  don't already know, this book is not going to tell you.  The writing style  is not especially clear, either.  If this is one of the best texts  available, I can see why nobody learns classical history anymore 
 The guy is a liar...where I come from that doesn't add up to much.  
 The construction is pretty poor in my opinion. Bought these for my boys to play with and they didn't last a month. The boys are 10 and 11. Range is bad, reception is bad, battery life bad 
 I agree with michel that there are a lot of mistakes in the book. It is good for the questions but NOT for the answers. 
 Spong refuses to realize that God doesn't change, Scripture doesn't change, and therefore the Church shouldn't change.  To call the Church "anachronistic" for its attitudes on sexuality is to punt away the truth.  Granted, there have been abuses fo power by the church in many instances in areas such as these, and these are to be addressed and fixed, but to completely reevaluate, as Spong endorses, the Church's approach to how it stands in the face of modernity is to bow down to modernity as to an idol.  I hope and pray that Spong comes to a saving knowlege of Jesus Christ someday, and abandons the liberal nonsense that he worships in the place of the God he claims to serve 
 This book was readable and somewhat compelling in that I wanted to know what would happen next.  However, the narrative was ridiculous in its depiction of the character's lives.  A UCLA professor who seems to have all kinds of free time for attending events with her famous movie star husband?  It reinforces the stereotype of college professors having an easy job that doesn't require any more time than giving lectures (with apparently no preparation), going on sabbatical whenever they feel like it, and traveling to exotic places to do research.  That was just one of the silly descriptions in this very silly book.  I had to work to suspend my disbelief long enough to finish it.  It was like watching a soap opera - a guilty pleasure 
 Oh, dear.I must be missing something here, given the superlative reviews others have written. Where's the plot? Where's the character development? Where's the narrative arc? Where's the dramatic tension? I'm not quite done, but I have found this book almost impossible to follow. I can't get a handle on what's real in the story versus what is a dream or a fantasy. The story switches back between the past and the present, and the narrator's childlike voice leaves me confused as to what is actually happening. Not my cup of tea, though I recognize I'm in the minority here. 
 This book is a poisonous but convincingly well written attack on divorce.  It's conclusions --- that divorce pretty much always destroys the children --- kept me in a bad marriage many years longer than necessary, and it's conclusions are flawed.  First of all, this is a very small study of people who volunteered to be included, so the families under consideration are far from representative of the population as a whole. (The participants were offered free counseling, so you could argue that Dr. Wallerstein was selecting for the least functional divorces.) Moreover, there's no control group, so it's unclear which of the problems that Wallerstein discusses are actually caused by the divorce and which or are commonplace in society as a whole. (Other studies point to the latter.) She simply assumes that everything bad was caused by the divorce.  This book, however, is an effective indictment of the too-common arrangement, where the mother gets the kids and the father is banished to a four-day-a-month visiting schedule---an arrangement that's almost guaranteed to be bad for the kids. Most of the divorces she discusses work that way. There are other alternatives, however, that are much less destructive, and Wallerstein's book discusses none of these.  I strongly recommend that you read Mavis Heatherington's "For Better or For Worse: Divorce Reconsidered" and Constance Ahrons' "The Good Divorce: Keeping Your Family Together When Your Marriage Comes Apart," either instead of, or at least as a complement to Wallerstein's book. These books are based on much larger studies, done properly in the sense of looking at a large, randomly selected, group of subjects with control groups in place. They come to very different conclusions than Wallerstein 
 For the naive (like me) this is a comic book in disguise! Apparently if reading is a challenge, you can turn to "graphic novels".  What a disappointment. I settled down for a long winter evening's read and was done in a heartbeat. Sure, there is plenty of violence, but the plot is thinner than Kate Moss.  On the other hand, if you can't handle more than 10 words per page, maybe you will find the plot challenging. As for the surprise ending -- even a ten year old gets tired of seeing rabbits being pulled out of hats 
 This book was a rather sordid and ugly look at genders and relationships.  Heinlein is so different here than in his good books (Tunnel in the Sky, Starship Troopers, Door into Summer, or Orphans of the Sky) that I wondered who actually wrote this awful work.  It seems obsessed with sleezy gender roles and is quite anti-woman. The basic premise is what would happen with a man's brain in a female body.  Maybe a good concept, but it is terrible in application here.  I just hated this book. I was appalled at some of the slams women take in this work. Please consider avoiding this work.  Perhaps every writer deserves some grace, but this work is almost beyond redemption.  Maybe Heinlein was ill while writing this, or maybe his editor was on drugs?   
 FYI - My Life Without Me has no soundtrack available. But imdb.com gave me enough info to at least pin down this song. "Sometime later" from this album is what's playing at the end credits of My Life Without Me. (And the song playing in the car when Lee and Ann kiss is "Senza Fine", I forget the artist. 
 [...] I got a choice of a free subscription to either Parents or Child magazine. Since I already got Parents, I chose Child. I will not be renewing when my free subscription is up. The magazine is boring, the articles irrelevant and there are too many kids fashion pages. If you want a magazine about parenting/kids, go with Parents. 
 Suggest you test your digital capability to download eBooks and open them  by using Acrobat's "File\Digital Editions\Authorize Devices" before buying as Acrobat now requires a drm activation on each computer by computer and this apparently has to be transferred one to the other, and the worst part is that they apparently have major problems with their drm activation server such that I have been unable to get my "instant" pdf book for two days now. There many entries in the Adobe forum on this issue. The book involved is the Balanced Scorecard Step-by-step. Adobe has scored a zero on this one for me.  The experience is enough to turn one off all future eBooks. 
 I've *actually* read the entire book and it's a peice of trash, I actually threw it away it disgusted me so much. The author said that if you don't tell people you're pregnant your baby will think he/she is not wanted and you can miscarry because of that! Unbelievably ignorant, this author has obviously never dealt with miscarriage or infertility. I picked up this book thinking it would have natural remedies(you know like herbs) and it's a lot of meditations and visualizations which is fine and good for anyone trying to conceive but with infertility I don't care how many times I pray to buddah it's just not going to happen without a doctor's help. Don't waste your time on the rest of the book, it's not worth it and they wouldn't give a huge preview if it wa 
 I read this book and find it poorly written.  The Author has no real story line, he keeps going off in different directions and never keeping to the story at hand.  He puts too much junk into it.  First rule of any writing - keep it simple and straight to the one and leave the fluff out 
 Wild at Heart can captivate your interest and suck you in to believing it's all good.Problem with this book is that it is not sound when it comes to true untwisted scripture.I first loved this book and it began to change me until I researched further only to discover that The Bible has been used incorrectly.If you don't believe me,just punch in Wild at Heart on any search engine and read the complications with these writings.If you are a believer you will see in a very short time what I mean. If you're not a believer I suggest you purchase a Bible instead.With much love to all.......................... 
 I bought the software some months ago.  Noticed some problems with my PC in subsequent weeks. Didn't put 2 and 2 together.  Last week however, I'd come home - no icons on screen - no ability to Ctrl-Alt_Del - each day this would happen. The machine had to be powered on and off to reboot. Pulled recent software off machine. Yes - you've guessed - without Spy Sweeper I have no problems. OK - it might be a conflict with other software - a quick Google confirmed my suspicions that others have problems. I was never impressed that it was picking up anything of substance either - but then maybe my machine is clean 
 Do not buy this poor DVD. It is a waste of your money 
 Oh my good god, this book is so full of typos and typesetting errors it's physically hard to believe. Nevertheless, there is some good information here. The strategy info is marginal, nothing eye-opening if you've played games much. The crunchy bits like the tables of units and improvements are nice to have. In the end, I would probably recommend you skip this guide just to punish Brady for allowing it out the door in such primordial condition. You can always get the same information (and way more besides) on fan sites like Apolyton or CivFanatics 
 I have never read a book so boring in my life!  I read Erotique Noir, and  there were good poems here and there.  I was hoping Dark Eros would have  filled the gaps that were left by Erotique Noir, but the poems and writings  just got more and more boring.  There were VERY few writings I would have  even considered to be even remotley called erotica.  I am very dissapointed  in this effort.  Its seems who ever put it together has lost the passion we  feel as a pepole 
 I did not enjoy this book at all because it was writen in a very distracting fashion.  While it was unique, it was too hard to get into.  I also really hated the story, it was also too confusing to follow, to strange to enjoy, and to boring to care.  I totally hated this book and it was near torture and a waste of time to read.  The only reason that I read this was because it was for my book club.  The reivews, by the way, in the club were 50/50.  Some loved it, the rest of us hated it.  There was no in-between.  I would only recommend this book to someone who is into odd literature or to English majors, I'm not sure who else would like it 
 Evidently the Pequots didn't speak with this guy. I can see why. The book is really tendentious. I'd suggest instead "Hitting The Jackpot" by a former Washington Post reporter. I heard about it in the local newspaper and it's very good. Much more informed and balanced and powerful. Whichever book you like, get educated on this 
 All the reviews of this book that I read included the words "Well written". This book has a good language, and includes good information on several parts of the world. But it still lacks something. I believe that Hamish McRae has not put enough stress on some very important economic regions, such as South East Asia (the Indian SubContinent), Eastern Europe and Eastern Africa. The only reason why that could be is because of incomple research. This lets the readers draw wrong conclusions about these parts. I would not recommend this book to a friend or use it for any sort of research 
 I enjoyed reading the story of Ann Baumgartner Carl, an aviatrix that challenged the bigotry and mysoginy of the 1940s United States in order to serve her country.  The book, as it was, was interesting and enjoyable.  Its problem is that it is too short and sometimes only brushes subjects that a reader may wish to know more about.  I would have liked in particular to learn more about the personalities of a few people described in the book and who played important roles in the aviation career of the author.  This book is still a good bet however to pass some quiet time at home or during a trip 
 Ordered this product Feb. 3rd and as of today (March 10th) I have not received the product or any information as to why.  I finally ordered this product elsewhere and received it in three days.  Still waiting to find out if I will receive a refund into my account for this product, since it was paid for in advance.       NOT IMPRESSE 
   This book was really horrible because.It was really bad.   The reason I didn't like it is because. It was really boring and   stuped. Because thay used old words like Mama, Papa and insted   of dinner thay use supper.    It was also really sad in the beginning because her father dies  her dad died in a stable accident. The stable fell on him. While   he was working on them.    The only part I liked was when she was going to try to get her   own room because. She bugged her sisters and her mom and dad. But  it really got anoing after a while.  Those are the resons I   didn't like like the book     
 I love jazz, and I love almost all Coltrane, but I'll be honest. I find these shows a bit difficult to listen to.  There's just too much wheezing and squeeling here for my ear.  I find myself whincing at times. Other times it's not seeming to go anywhere. There's something pathological about Coltrane's playing.  He sounds a bit like a dying cat.  He must have been heavy into the Heroin by this point. 
 this book is useless...I bought it along with two other Access books and immediately sent it back and of course A-.com ripped me off by refunding only 50% of the price...pathetic 
 Without the historical context in the early 70s, `Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song' makes no sense at all. But if you have some knowledge about so-called blaxploitaion films, minor film genre made mainly for Afro-American audiences in the 70s, `Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song' is still a very bizarre experience to you. And I am a Japanese, fan of Pam Grier films, but I believe the film about `Sweet Sweetback' looks strange wherever you live.  The content or message of `Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song' can be summarized in the following words you will see at the beginning of the film: "This film is dedicated to all the Brothers and Sisters who had enough of the Man." Most probably before this film no film had ever tried to show a black character hitting and knocking out a white (and a white cop for that matter), and for better or worse, the way the film does it is amazingly raw and crude.  The Man is represented by several non-descriptive white cops who beat up a black. When star and director Melvin Van Peebles says he had enough, he (or his character) shows it by bludgeoning the cops senseless. The police (largely whites) are not competent enough to chase Sweetback, and he gets away very easily from them. By the conventional standard of narrative, the film is almost pointless, going on and on without showing where it is leading us. Occasionally we see Sweetback helped by some and betrayed by others (including blacks), or the strange episodes of Sweetback drinking the water in the mud.   It might look strange today that the film actually became a big hit in 1971, but it did. What distinguishes `Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song' from the films like `Shaft' and `Coffy' both commercial success, is the crudeness of its message and the techniques. As to the message there is nothing that I can add here, I tried to find the sub-texts in the scenes of Melvin Van Peebles running endlessly in the street of LA, or lots of nude bodies in the film, but could find nothing in them.   You know what you should expect from the low-budget film with less-than-enough lighting equipment. That happened in the films like `Superfly.' But `Superfly' doesn't have so many double exposures, out-of-focus images, and other tricks that could be seen only in the psychedelic era. At the same time, the film is also notable for clever use of the jazzy and funky soundtrack by Earth Wind and Fire, setting the trend of the blaxploitaion films and their music.   But all these things do not prove that the film is still good as entertainment nor justify the abundant nudities and sex scenes. The opening section showing young Sweetback (played by Melvin's real-life son Mario) is still unnecessarily graphic and even shocking to some today.   Perhaps as Mario Van Peebles did in his `Baadassss!' a filmic account of the making, `Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song' is most interesting if seen with social and personal history behind itself. Otherwise, the messy film is hard to enjoy as it is today 
 This was a book that was better not written, or at least not published. As Woody Allen once coined a phrase, the book is, "a miasma of asinine cliches unrivaled in Western Literature." Why should any self-respecting individual want to read yet another paltry story of excusess as to why a drug addict became a drug addict ( and who seems to have a somewhat sardonic pride in his past addiction.)Being a Kennedy is not worth a plug nickle--and as this Kennedy shows--it sure dosen't make you smart.     
 So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin.   There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural,  mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong.  
 People who read this book carefully will find that many of the examples in the book contain flawed reasoning. The sloppy logic often leads one to understand certain concepts in a wrong way. The book does have lots of long-winded mathematical derivations, but they don't really add to the reader's physical insight. (eg. in chapter 11, some simple linear algebra that can be done in three lines are instead derived in pages of summations and index swap) This book is a disgrace to the teaching of physics. Its tedious, sometimes illegitimate algebra spoils the elegance of classical mechanics. Compare it with Landau, and you will see the point 
 First of all, this book mentions "the heart" and strays from the truth of scripture terribly. God's word says the "heart is deceitful above all things and who can know it?" There is nothing good in our hearts, apart from Christ, and whatever "good" there might be in there comes from Him. Scripture tells us that in the last days the church will go into apostasy. This time has come like no other time before. There is a move to to throw out scripture and move past it, ignoring what God has already told us. What we need to know is in scripture--especially those things we need to know about Him and what He requires of us. This move in the church today to "feel" God and go "to a deeper level" is a reawakening of mysticism which does not belong in the body of Christ. The truth and objectives of scripture are not mystical, for a reason. Jesus Christ was and is not a mystic. This movement is called "contemplative spirituality" and it is subtle and dangerous. Sadly, even Eldredge has taken this route. How many more good authors and great men of God are going to forsake the completeness of God's word to turn inward to "self" and think they will find something new? Solomon said, "there is nothing new under the sun." The devil wants us to think we can reinvent and invent "new" outside of God's marvelous confines. We need to stick to scripture and stop reading books like these written by men who want to offer us something more than the Lord commanded us. We are treading on shaky ground, but all we need is His glorious word and to do what He said: "Keep my commandments. 
 Sometimes I've enjoyed books by David Baldacci (WISH YOU WELL and THE WINNER come to mind); others, such as THE LAST MAN STANDING did little for me . . . add SPLIT SECOND, which I just heard, to that latter list . . . it was a disappointing mystery thriller about two disgraced Secret Service agents who come together to solve two campaign-trail crimes . . . I cared little about any of the characters, and there were far too many subplots floating around for my taste . . . the ending also didn't do much for me, as it brought too many separate threads together in too quick a fashion . . . lastly, I did not particularly "buy" the man behind the crimes; he just wasn't  all that believable. 
 The author describes his main character as "a thoroughly modern young woman in a society rather like Britain and the US in the early sixties." His interpretation of how such a person thinks and talks is so distracting.  It is like reading Nancy Drew mixed with Donna Reed dialogue.  The main character writes in her diary with sentences like "Oh, Diary Dearest" and follows with other nauseating dialogue with her parents.  It made me want to throw the book across the room.  I seriously considered not reading it after the first few pages.  In her diary entries, she is merging terms together that are new to her.  For instance "Planiturth" for "planet Earth."  When one is describing complex mathematic concepts, there is no need to add mumbo jumbo like that.  The concepts are alfready difficult to grasp, without having to sort what she is referring to.  I don't see the value of doing this.  The mathematics writing is adequate for the most part.  The concepts were easy for me to understand.  And these are rather complex concepts.  I studied no further than calulus in school, so not a good deal of foreknowledge is needed.  Although a lot of patience is needed.  He makes several contradictory statments.  "The red ball got bigger and bigger until she could only see a small part of it."  If it is getting bigger, why is she seeing less of it? All things considered he would have been better off just writing a math book, rather than trying to make it into a crappy, cutesy story.  He had a lot of hubris to think he could stay on par with the original classic 
 Anyone who can say, on page 6, that a man whose mother's death when he is 10 days old causes him to "suffer from a devastating loss and its concomitant anger" is more a cliched than a clear thinker 
 I purchased this CD after reading several of the reviews and generally liking TMBG myself. I must say I am quite disappointed with this CD. The music is, in my opinion, not engaging in the least and strikes me as way too complex for small children. Nothing on this album "stuck with me" in the sense that I did not walk away humming any of the songs after hearing them. In fact, I found a few songs to be so unappealing I either felt like I couldn't wait for them to end or I just forwarded to the next track quickly. I do consider myself to have a fairly eclectic taste when it comes to music and was surprised by my aversion to this CD. My recommendation is to consider this only for older children, say age 6 or more and, if possible, try before you buy 
 This book was quite boring. Within the first few pages (when Ruby describes her own birth) hints were dropped about the ultimate "big secret" of the book. By the time I'd read a quarter of the book, there were so many hints it wasn't a secret any more. By the time I got to the end, I was disappointed that there wasn't anything more to the story than that. None of the characters were particularly likeable, nor were they bad enough to hate.  The book was billed as "darkly funny and satirical" in one review. I saw no humor except for the brief slapstick physical mishaps at a wedding reception late in the book. On reflection, I gained nothing from reading this book, and got about a half-minute of laughter from that one scene. It truly was a waste of my limited reading time 
 I was disappointed as to how little information was in this book.  Additionally, several pages of the were printed out of sequence.  I had the feeling this thing was thrown together. Some 64 of the book's 280 pages is a glossary.  Don't waste your money. Shame on you Nellie and Peter 
 This short book is about the small Tuck family (a man, his wife, two young-adult sons, and their horse) , who inadvertently drink from a magic spring which renders them immortal.  Thereafter, they do not age, and seem immune to death by violence or accident.  In this state, they seem to live a happy, almost idyllic existence.  Nonetheless, they bemoan their fate as a sort of curse, which has removed them from the cycle of life.  Mrs. Tuck especially seems convinced that it would be a disaster if anyone else were to find out about the magic spring.  The exception to this sighing and moaning is the youngest son, who, perhaps because he has the good fortune to be stuck at 17, seems reasonably satisfied with his fate.  The main events of the story take place 84 years later, when a series of improbable coincidences involving the Tucks, an 11-year old girl, and a mysterious stranger, together with some idiotic behavior by all concerned, converge to force events to an contrived climax.  The author hints that these improbable convergences have some deep mystical significance.  Since this mysticism remains obscure, one is inclined to instead suspect lazy plotting.  The stupidity, and moral depravity, of the Tucks is evident in the fact that, for the last 84 years, they have done virtually nothing to conceal, guard, protect or destroy the magic spring.  And yet when (by pure luck) they learn that the spring is about to be discovered, they are willing to commit kidnapping and even murder to keep the secret from getting out.   The author strives to make the murder victim as unlikable as possible so that the killer (the Tuck mom) will retain our sympathies.  But the bottom line is that the sole motive for the murder is that the victim knew too much and could not be counted upon to keep a secret.  I cannot possibly agree that Mrs. Tuck had any right, therefore, to take his life.  The fact that the victim gloats about his less-than-noble intentions immediately before she shoots him, does not make her act any more morally palatable.  The stream, after all, does not belong to the Tucks.  What right have they to play God, and take lives to prevent others from sharing their high and lonely (if idyllic) destiny?  Setting aside moral questions, the stupidity of the Tucks is nothing compared to the stupidity of the villain.  Why on Earth did he not drink from the stream and render himself immortal?  Why on Earth did he not do this before going all by himself to a secluded location to have a gloating, taunting confrontation with four fully-grown immortals.  He is fully aware that the Tucks are determined to keep their secret, he knows exactly why, and he knows they are desperate or depraved enough to commit the kidnapping of a child for this purpose.  In fact, why does he confront them at all?  They were completely unnecessary to his plans, as he himself points out when, predictably, the Tucks refuse to agree to them.  Bottom line is, he went merely because the author wanted to give Mrs. Tuck an opportunity to shoot him, and he gloated and taunted only so the reader might say "Ha, serves you right", when sweet Mrs. Tuck blows his head off with a shotgun.  One of the ironies of this story is that, although the Tucks are convinced that the widespread availability of the magic water would be a disaster, we are nonetheless supposed to despise the villain for his selfishness, when he reveals his plan to disseminate the water only to those well-paying persons he considers most deserving.   And yet when Jesse, the youngest immortal, starts plotting to do something similar, we are expected to retain our sympathies for him.  I suppose this is because Jesse is a hot-looking 17-year old, is motivated (one supposes) by romance rather than cash, and his offer is, in effect, being made to the young female who is the target audience of this book.    I have no need to say how this latter plot thread resolves itself.  In the end, the moral of the story is ambiguous.  There is a lot of preaching about the curse of immortality, and the virtue of remaining a part of the life cycle, but what we are actually shown is beautiful people living an apparently idyllic existence in harmony with nature.  Is the moral of the story that we should not seek Earthly immortality, or that, if we should find it, we should keep it for ourselves?    This was a quick, easy, relaxing read.  It could have been much worse, but, on the theme of immortality, you will also find plenty better (Potter books, Narnia, Lord of the Rings, just to name a few) 
 I was surprised to open this book and find no maps. This makes it very hard to get oriented once you've found the trail. The writing is too general and bland. I'm sticking to titles that are more pertinent to the region that have more detailed descriptions. I would have preferred more quality than quantity and more photographs 
 Aside from Tatum's whining about every game the Raiders lost, and his incessant bad-mouthing of the Pittsburgh Steelers of the 70's, I actually enjoyed Tatum's first book, "They Call Me Assassin".  Tatum's second book, "They Still Call Me Assassin", was almost an exact reprint of the first book, except it included a few more of Tatum's self-serving rants that would interest no one outside of Tatum's immediate family.  Now, in this third installment, we are given exact reprints of both books.  Amazingly, the reprinted portions of "They Call me Assassin" that were in "They Still Call Me Assassin" are left in "Final Confessions", so much of the reprinted material in "Final Confessions" appears twice in the book!  The actual `new' material takes up a whole 12 pages in the 348 page fiasco.  Don't waste your money now, simply wait until the fourth Tatum book appears on the market, "I Still Have Final Confessions", and has the exact reprints of volumes 1-3 
 To all real rockers in the 70's, Kiss was considered a joke band, a band for the teeny-bopper, rocker wannabe's. Alice Cooper and The Tubes did it correctly; they had the stage show, but also had the music and band to back it up. Kiss was/is all sizzle and no steak. I gave them 2 stars because they did have a couple of ok tunes, but I still cringe whenever I see or hear Paul Stanley. There's so much great rock from the 70's.....it just does not include Kiss 
 I never purchased this movie so I can't very well review it.  However, I did see it on television and wasn't that impressed 
 I just wanted to give an update on my progress.  I cannot, with good conscience, support Diane's program any longer.  I am currently weight training, doing cardio, and eating healthy.  Eating healthy is not eating whatever you want.  In 12 weeks, I brought my risk factor for heart disease down from 5.9:1 (which is horrible) to around 3 (which is nonexistent risk).  I did it with exercise and eating right.  I also lost two sizes with just a 12 pound scale loss because I was gaining muscle, too.  To be healthy, you have to work at it!  Sure, you can lose weight eating whatever you want if you eat less - at least up to a point.  But who wants to be a skinny fat woman or a skinny fat man?  Wouldn't you rather be healthy and have a fabulous physique?  Try Body for Life by Bill Phillips.  Also check out the www.bodybuilding.com website for inspiration, education, and good products 
 Although Maureen Waller has produced a good piece of researh it was clearly written for the British, if not London, reader. The information and terminology is very specific to that great city. If you are not completely comfortable with the geography and customs of London, don't read it. 
 Walters becomes very wordy in her second chapter and continues throught the entire book this way.  She has several interesting chapters in which she gives critical interpretations of popular films and television shows,  however, they fail to make up for the dullness of the entire book.  She is  overly critical of previous methods of feminist criticism, while at the  same time almost cocky about her own superior viewpoint.  In the end, she  never actually has a viewpoint of her own, except that someone else should  pick up the ball and develop a new feminist methodology.  Her wordiness  seemed to be nothing more than a cover for a lack of original thought.   This book is definately not for the new student of feminism or for the  skeptic.  There are many other enlightening books on the subject.   Unfortunately this is not one of them and it would be terrible for the book  to turn off any more people to the subject as it did myself 
 my friends all just read this and we're all disappointed in it, maybe someone who knows less about kate moss would get more from it.  it IS articulate and factual, and it's not that it's BAD writing, it just didn't give us anything new to talk about.  i wish there were other biographies - even if totally sensationalized! - about kate moss out there!  my recommendation?  maybe a good beach-time or bus-ride read, but don't expect anything revealing 
 Yes, it does provide a bit more eye relief, and can make it easier to see the whole frame (by making it smaller), BUT there is a major problem with this.  The eyepiece lens surface will not be as deeply couched in the rubber trim when you use this, and the result is a lot more reflections flashing around in the eyepiece when you have light behind you.  This is especially a problem when you are wearing glasses.  
 I usually read through one of Coulter's novel in a few days, exspecially her FBI/intrigue plots. I bought this as soon has it was released in paperback and still haven't finished it. The plot was slow and the main heroine a little too likable. Spoiler: Neighborhood teenagers diving on her body to protect her from bullets?! Talk about a work of fiction. No one expects a romance to be on our plane of reality, but in the same solar system would be nice 
 This movie is very weird and it makes you really dizzy. It shows you the end first and then shows you the events that lead up to it. Not a movie for children at all 
 The track with BG is standard, just like the original but with an added section featuring rap by BG 
 The book is probably great to those that know nothing about any psychological concepts.  But most of the information is already out there on the internet or in other psychological books.  This is definately not for people who already have done prior research.  Many of the ideas like finding your "inner child" seem somewhat implausible to me.  
   Maybe I am naive, but I think if a book promises total self-confidence, it ought to deliver.  This book does not deliver.   I admit, any book making these kind of claims would have a tough time delivering on them, but the main reason I am disappointed is that the ideas espoused in this book are hardly original.  Instead, his ideas range from cliche' statements lifted straight from Dale Carnegie ("be a good listener", "let the other guy know you are impressed with him") to the purely metaphysical, such as "whatever the human mind can conceive, it can acheive" (now, pardon me for just a second while I use my mind power to get out of this wheelchair).   For somebody with absolutely no self-confidence, these tips are good to start out with, but for most people they will simply be common sense.  A reader should expect a lot more from someone who has a Ph.D. in the subject. 
 This book sat on my bookshelf for a couple of years, and I finally decided to get to it last week. I should have left it where it was. Although it gives you a decent overview of Chess and its artists, it reads like a dry listing of every recording session and every song that Chess ever did - most of which are of absolutely zero importance, and which nobody cares about. When it does mention a little tidbit that might be more interesting, it is usually given a sentence, maybe two if you're lucky. Furthermore, the author jumps all over the place for each topic; he goes back and forth between decades at the drop of a hat - and the company wasn't around that long. The writing is extremely sloppy, and uses odd punctuation and structure. I think that this may just be a British style of writing (the author is from London, according to the jacket). Whatever it is, it is really irritating for an American to read. If you've never read anything by a British writer, and you plan to read this book, prepare to be annoyed. The book would have been served better if it had been re-edited for publication in America. Also, I'll mention that the author puts WAY too much emphasis on how Chess did in Britain. I acknowledge that Britain played an important part in the revitalization of blues music in the 1960's, but really, does anybody care how The Dells sold in the UK? In general, by the writing and the content, it seems that the book was written by a British fan, one who likes the music, but doesn't have much of a clue of where it came from or why 
 If you like the Dirk Pitt series & the Kurt Austin series, don't bother reading this book! The action is NOT there, nor is the intrigue that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series.  This book was not as 'action-packed' as the two other series, and left me wishing the book to be over.  I had to 'make' myself finish the book, and even then, my only comment was "That's it?!" It's definitely NOT the 'page-turner' type story that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series. And, to be honest, I miss the 'cameo' appearances of the author in the Pitt novels 
 It is true that most trading systems whether rigorously conceived or whimsical will generate at least momentary profits. However, this books disguises a whimsical trading system with nebulously defined rules as something derived from the rules of probability. While few popular books follow the rigor of a financial engineering text, this book is appalling. Not only could this have been written in ten pages, but those ten pages are not worth reading. The language of the market is statistics but a rigorous introductory text is the way to go rather than the appealing but false illusion of "high-probability setups". Mr. Toshchakov should consider how much of his performance is luck. Learning to trade successfully in the markets requires a firm backing in finance. Your money would be better spent on a subscription to The Econonmist or Financial Times, than on Mr. Toschchakov's next Jaguar. 
 This was one of the worst examples of rehashing previous consulting work and placing between two hard covers that I have ever witnessed.  I have had over 20 years of strategy consulting experience with global firms, and have taught at one of the top ten business schools.  I would never use this book with my students.  It shifts back and forth from anecdote to cut and paste diagrams, with no structure or detailed description of the actual methodology and approaches that are used in serious market research efforts.  Don't waste your time 
 The hullabaloo surrounding the book will lead one to believe that this is an epitome of all adventure/suspense stories. In reality, the book is nothing but a wanderings of a disturbed mind, disillusioned with life and suffering from abnormalities of mind - so common among soldiers after attending a bloody war. Those readers who praise the book sky-high must have some ulterior motive in mind; otherwise this is a shoddy piece of work and written obviously with a film script in mind rather than a book, which anyways what Hilton was, scriptwriter in Hollywood!  His other tiny book  Goodbye Mr. Chips is a better read and doesn't pretend to be something else or is it we who label a book. No wonder Lost Horizon is out of print and should remain so. I don't blame the writer as much as the so-called critics, readers and other writers for whom the world begins in Western Europe and ends in North America. A very myopic view!    
 I hate to be the only critic, but I feel I must interject here for all the skeptics out there. The reviews for this book must be coming from an extremely specific-and therefore biased beyond belief-group of people. Never fear! I am here to save the day with an (I'm sure) equally biased answer to the opposite side. This book is championed for its elevated action and incredible adventure, but truth be told, I found myself bored throughout the novel, always desiring to skim large portions to get to the "good part" (which never arrived by the way). The novel lacked cohesion and organic unity, and felt disjointed at best. This, however, must be forgiven in a novel of this ilk. After all, we don't expect our fantastic adventure novels to rank among esteemed literature. What can be expected, I think, is a page-turning, voracity-inspiring, un-put-down-able (forgive me for lack of concision but it had to be said) novel and you will not find that here. Perhaps I have high standards, but if the book is poorly written, I at least have the right to demand that it doesn't bore me to a dire degree, right? I believe the main problem is that David Gemmel fails at putting you in touch, emotionally, with the story line and characters. First off, his characterization is non-existent, leaving the characters static and uniform. I get the feeling that he wished to represent characters as human, being neither the extreme of good or evil (an admirable goal), but he failed. Guy Gavriel Kay, for one, champed Gemmel here. In his book, I could not help but be utterly empathetic to both sides of the fight. In Gemmel's novel, I was merely confused by the sudden, and seemingly random, changes in character. If he is attempting to elucidate development, or the double-sided nature of people, he executes it poorly. For example, Kaelin lashes out in the beginning of the novel when a friend dies. Later, however, he is extremely calm in the face of a much closer relative's death. In the mean time, no development, mentally is exclaimed. If he is suddenly wise and accepting of the world, it's deus ex machina style. I truly believe that none of this would be true but for the extreme dearth of characterization. In any case, I felt left out in the metaphorical cold, apathetic to the fate of the characters. My other major complaint is that the way he constructed the plot was bewildering and nonsensical to me. It played out multiple inapropos lines of the story, while leaving the critical prophecy unfulfilled and unexplained. To be fair, this is part of a series I believe, though it is difficult to tell which part as that is not referenced anywhere that I can find. If it is meant to stand alone, it certainly fails. Honestly though, from the most purely analytic point of view possible, the plot was ineptly done and baffling at best. It truly lacked cohesion. This is all not to mention the fact that the dialogue was awkward and the prose mediocre. Succinctly said, I would not recommend reading this book, but don't take my word for it. Many other reviewers seem to praise the concise characterization that I hated 
 This book is too detailed for the average user as I have seen some of the instructionals from within this book that a friend purchased as a guide; it didn't seem to help. Most of the help he/she has gotten with XP has been verbal/written advice from me and a few other friends who are PC savvy. The book would be worth it somewhat, if the price were listed at 75% less than it is now

 After enjoying the first novel in this series I was really looking forward to this sequel.  It started out pretty well but soon went downhill.  The plot is barely believable and the "woe is me" and handwringing gets old.  I don't think I'll even bother with the third book - wish I hadn't already bought it 
 We live in a society that puts a third of its black population in cages, so it's soothing for some to have figures like Thomas "who stole the" Sowell to deceive us into blaming the victims of institutionalized racism.  First, to suggest that the West has been the great liberator of those who were enslaved is misleading, we've simply outsourced our slaves to sweatshops around the world.  Moreover, the wage slaves here, working 60 or 70 hours a week, oftentimes don't even recognize themselves as slaves.  Instead, they boast of their fine "work ethic", the same sort of attitude any slave master would want to cultivate. Regarding gangsta rap, it's the sort of music that white-owned stations and distributors are happy to promote.  It serves many ideological purposes, including giving whites an object they can point at as proof of black depravity (while white America applauds their favorite gangsta programs like "The Sopranos," and their favorite gangstas of Big Business like Dick Cheney).  The on-going war against minorities not only involves the CIA pouring crack into their communities (see Gary Webb's "Dark Allliance"), it also involves cultural warfare and psy-ops.  Conscious rap by groups like Public Enemy, Blackalicious, Dead Prez, Common, KRS-ONE, The Coup and many others is not played on the public's airwaves that have been seized by Clear Channel and other media barons.  Such music would inform and empower black communities, and our power elite doesn't want that happening.  They prefer to have a desperate underclass to be recruited for the imperial forces, or to be the bodies that produce revenue in our growing prison industrial complex.  Minorities are also further debilitated by receiving the dope that Big Pharma likes to push - prozac, ritalin, zoloft and other drugs.  The traditional use of marijuana by black and brown people represents a threat to the market share of Eli Lilly and Novartis. Pharma executives don't have a patent on pot, so this "War on (some) Drugs" has become the perfect vehicle through which minorities can be put in cages, seperated from their families, and put to work at 10 cents an hour.  Our prisons are our modern-day slave ships, where violence, psychological abuse, and sexual assault are rampant.  I imagine some of Sowell's most adoring fans are making a comfortable living as prison guards or DEA agents, and therefore appreciate the manner in which Sowell sells out his own people. Fortunately, there are honest scholars we can learn from if we have a shred of intellectual integrity.  People like Cornel West, Angela Davis, Manning Marable and Mumia Abu Jamal.  These figures won't be welcomed onto our empire's airwaves, nor will their books receive massive funding for promotion; but the truths they reveal are available to all those who don't have an emotional need to cling to Sowell's endless deceptions. Right-wing white folk are no doubt the most intellectually irresponsible creatures to walk the planet, but to those who still retain some curiousity, the website of the rapper Paris provides a combination of some of the most powerful music of dissent you'll ever hear, as well as news on a range of issues affecting minority communities.  Simply search for "Guerrilla Funk dot com"        
 But if anyone asked me what these stories were about I would not be able to tell them. I remember the titles and some of the details but not the stories. Way over my head. And I am a pretty well-read person so it's not that I'm just not a reader. I wouldn't recommend this really highly because her novels are so much better. Try The King's General, The House on the Strand 
 The book was poor but had a lot of good photo of stevie nicks, I have walked with stevie on her long road of life for meany year now, 20 and counting. If you are looking to find yourself for who you are look to  stevie nicks. PELA STEVIE ALWAYS BE TRUE TO YOURSELF 
 If mind-bending thrillers like Basic Instinct prove anything, the theme of an expert becoming obsessed with his cryptic subject presents a great deal of potential. This film attempts a similar tapestry. Our protagonist (Ewan McGregor) finds himself progressively involved in eavesdropping a disturbing femme fatale across the street (Ashley Judd) who's in the blackwidow-spider type habit of zapping all males she beds. Problem is, nothing much happens of this premise. We never find ourselves feeling for the agent or his liege. No romantic overtures with dangerous undertones. No edge of the seat interactions ala Sharon Stone films of the early 90s. Instead, there's a queer apparition of the agent's daughter that punctuates every second scene and adds to the pile of threads that end up nowhere. Such constant failure to take advantage of its almost-intriguing buildups gets the film my generous 1-star rating, anyone but McGregor's biographer needn't bother 
 When I reviewed Franken's "Why Not Me?" I explained that I had read it because I loved "Rush Limbaugh is a Big..." but "Why Not Me?" had fallen short of my high expectations.  THIS book was even MORE disappointing.  The subject matter is worn and the material is not that creative, and sadly, just not that funny.  Honestly, I WANTED to laugh- I LIKE Al Franken, but this book just feels forced, the kind of thing that's churned out just to meet a publisher's deadline and get Franken's face back to the front of book racks (Pre- "Lies..." of course).  It's worth reading if you are stuck on an airplane, or an elevator, or something.  Otherwise, pick something else by Franken.  ANYTHING else by Franken 
 I am not sure what protection an Ipod has, but difference between standard 5V USB and potential 12V is huge. Only the IPOD cable is useful from all this package. And do not be fooled by the low marked price. Sales will charge "handling and shipping" so the bottom price will not be cheap. If anyone in San Francisco area wants the wall adapter without the USB cable - it is yours for free, but you will have to pick it up : 
 Hundreds of writers have waded into the Arthurian waters and some have come away with great books. This isn't one of those times. The Guinivere in Dragon Queen is so perfect she's just a card board figure. The ruin of Merlin's character isn't even worth talking about. I bought it at 8:15 AM read it, didn't like and by 4 PM I got my money back 
 This appeared verbatim in the magazine THUNDER PRESS.  BTW, Zimberoff's next book (out next spring), a continuation and sequel to ART OF THE CHOPPER is dedictaed to INDIAN LARRY and contains a full chapter of his work, a portrait and his biography plus every other major builder on the planet.  Reviewed by Terry Roorda  QUOTE  Dated photos gleaned from the collection of photographer Michael Lichter combine with perfunctory prose by writer Mike Seate to bring us "Choppers: Heavy Metal Art," a shameless effort to cash in on the current chopper craze by using the exact format found in the highly acclaimed and successful "Art of the Chopper" by Tom Zimberoff. That's it in nutshell, folks. The similarities in physical size, style and content between this work and Zimberoff's are striking to say the very least: A fat highly- produced coffee table book that examines a roster of custom bike builders through portraiture, some biographical verbiage and studio photos of some of their creations.  That's where the similarities end. In the execution of that formula, Zimberoff's "Art of the Chopper" is fresh and literate while "Choppers: Heavy Metal Art" is stale and sophomoric. Seate's writing is lackluster at its best and painfully awkward most of the time, reading like the first draft of a work being produced on contract and on deadline. In three of the early vignettes in the book we are informed that "Colorado's Arlin Fatland has what you might call a wicked sense of humor," and that "Pat Kennedy of Tombstone, Arizona, is what you might call seriously old school," and that "Nothing about Kodlin's motorcycles is what you might call tradition- al." These excerpts are what you might call bad writing; the type of tedious template prose so devoid of creativity and enthusiasm for the subject matter that any editor worth the name would kick it back in disgust and demand another go. That's assuming there was an editor involved at all, and judging from the wealth of typos and awkward usages found in this book, there's little reason to believe there was. A truly ironic typo comes early in the going when in Seate's acknowledgments he pens this gem: "to Almetta, for never letting us forget the value of the wirtten word." Yes, folks, it says "wirtten." How's that for value?  Here's some other stuff that made me wince: "Looking like a cross between a scene from a concert by gangsta rappers Insane Clown Posse and a Felliniesque circus nightmare, Johnson's paint schemes grab a viewer's attention and hold it rapt for hours." Hunh? Or how about this stinker: "These self-anointed keepers of the hardtail faith congregate in Internet chat rooms and in the letters pages of custom motorcycle-enthusiast magazines to heap dis and envy on builders who aren't afraid to move the art of the custom motorcycle into the twenty-first century." Ouch.  There's plenty more where those came from. And the tragic thing about it is that Mike Seate is usually a competent and entertaining writer-and probably the most prolific wordsmith in the genre. Therein may lie the problem. This volume represents Seate's fifth book with the word "chopper" in the title, and four of those, including this one, were published in the span of less than a year and a half. Who wouldn't get burned out? The upside of "Choppers: Heavy Metal Art" are the images furnished by renowned biker photographer Michael Lichter, a man with one of the most impressive resumés in the industry. As always, his photos are luminous, and anyone familiar with his work in Easyriders magazine over the past couple of decades will recognize his style, but there's a problem here as well. These photos apparently came straight out of his existing inventory of bike feature shots, and many were taken years ago, going back as far as 1992. When you're making the case for custom bike building being a vibrant and dynamic craft in an exciting period of change, growth and popularity, wouldn't you want the timeliest material you could bring to the premise? Other complaints in this regard are that the names of the featured bikes are not provided, though they're often referred to in the copy, and the sparse technical data given for each consists only of frame style (rigid; Softail- type) and engine style (Panhead; Evolution-type), which are obvious attributes to anyone the least bit familiar with the subject, and of little or no educational value to those who aren't. Those criticisms aside, we have to understand that doing this book right would have taken some time, and clearly the publisher wanted to get into the market before Christmas with a product that would hopefully piggy- back on the success of "Art of the Chopper." That's understandable, if not admirable, from a business stand- point. From a creative standpoint it's disastrous. END QUOT 
 The simplified arrangements in this book gut the harmonic resonance of almost all the songs.  Numbers like "Dividing Day" and "The Beauty Is" are very nearly unrecognizable.  Thank you for the performance edition of "Light in the Piazza," now please,    release the Vocal Score, Mr. Guettel 
 Ethan Walker's "The Mystic Christ" does NOT AT ALL understand or explain the REAL Jesus Christ.  I'll return this literature as soon as I get the chance. It's completely bogus (with very little truth to it)I mean this man totally misunderstands the plan for redemption, what real love is meant by Christ, and any other reality pertaining to Christ.  If you want to understand Christ, TRULLY, then learn about Him from St. Francis of Assisi, St. John of the cross, St. Teresa of Avila, St. Vincent Ferrer, Fr. Reginald Garrigou - Lagrange, Dom Vitalis, Henry Manning, St. Thomas Aquinas, Sister Josepha Menendez,. Etc....These days it's very popular to twist and distort Jesus Christ by saying Lo here is "A" Christ and Lo there is "A" Christ.  This book lacks in real knowledge of Christ.  While some of this litarature has good points (not on Christ of course but on Buddha and Krsna,etc it does) it really only shows the authers lack of understanding Jesus' real plan and reason for His Incarnation.  The book should have been called "The Mystic Life" and NOT "The Mystic Christ".  Totally misleading and insulting toward Christ (Not "THE" or "A" Christ)....  If you want to be mislead then read this book.  If you want to be lead in the correct path then read "The Way Of Divine Love" by Sister Josepha Menendez if you really want to know THE REAL Jesus Christ (There is no Lo here and Lo there and there is no word "THE" and letter "A" in Christ). Do not fall for this sort of Neuro-Linquistic Programming... 
 Fiona Mountain had a good idea for a mystery with Bloodline, but she ruined it with her ham-fisted way of telling a story.  She seems never to have heard that the cardinal rule of good writing is "Show, don't tell", but repeatedly hits the reader over the head with the points she wants to make.  She insists on calling attention to the parallels between Natasha's life and the mystery she's investigating, as if she (the author) were afraid a reader wouldn't be clever enough to notice them on her own.  For example, in describing a scene that takes place in a garden, she says, "The exposed and tangled roots of the weeds were pale through the covering of dark soil", and then feels compelled to add, "The analogy of roots being ripped up wasn't lost on her."  Trust me, if you make it to page 262 (where this passage appears), the analogy wouldn't be lost on you either, even without the authorial intervention.      In my review of Mountain's previous book (Pale as the Dead), I commended her for not letting her research get in the way.  Unfortunately, that isn't the case with this book.  Too often, reading it felt like reading the author's research notes.  She even has one character -- an elderly woman who isn't an academic -- say that, in a conversation which took place many years ago, another character "quoted J. Hooper Harvey's Heritage of Britain".  I find it hard to believe that the character would have remembered not only the title of the book, but also the author's full name, right down to the "J. Hooper".  Sounds to me more like the author, fresh from the library, speaking.   The Natasha Blake mysteries are a bit like Sarah Stewart Taylor's Sweeney St. George mysteries (O' Artful Death, etc.), in that both series are about a young woman with an unusual job that causes her to get involved in solving mysteries from a different angle.   If that concept sounds intriguing to you, I would recommend that you spend some time with Sweeney St. George.  After reading Bloodline, I can't say the same for Natasha Blake.  
 Look at the world economy, Toyota just passed Ford in US, Sony is doing very good, even they make the dead-Ericson alive, look at Kodak, Panasonic, Honda, Japon Tobacco Ind, Seiko.... They all do excellent/very good, except a few industries as pharmetucals and FMCG, where US or Loreal gets all the profit from dumb products...  What is the reason for this? If you have some money to spend for nothing read this book, and read "Mind of Strategist" from Ohmae, and compare both of these books...   you will see the answer of the first paragraph above: US is dealing with theory and Japan with excellent execution.   This book is so theoretical that, almost none of the things mentioned are applicable. The critical thing is, even this book does not show how to think, since the writers are so much involved in theoretical aspects of strategy/game theory, in their offices at the universities that, applicability is dying in united states..  as told, there are some categories still US dominates, in belgium huge profits is done in pharmacy/beauty care products, as other US companies do in europe, (except Germany, Russia, UK, where Lever and Henkel is more powerful).  but all dying, thanks to theorical works as Co-opetition. As I told, please read Ohmae, and compare those books. The difference is so significant.   I do not know why this book get so much good comment, it can be due to positioning/image. But nothing inside. 
 Unfortunately the pet blinker didn't hold up very well.  I think a washer fell out or something but the unit came apart after day 1 
 I brought this last Christmas for my daughter, and I also recommended a co-worker of mine to do the same since her daughter was also two years old. Two days after Christmas the two front wheels fell off while she was riding it and they continued to fall off every time she would drive off the sidewalk into a grassy area or bush. There's a plastic round piece that holds the two wheels in place, but this piece doesn't fit properly to prevent the wheels from coming off. Two weeks later I went to visit my co-worker at home and she was experiencing the same problem. I got so sick and tired of putting the wheels back on while my daughter was outdoors riding it that I don't let her ride it anymore. Not worth the money or the time! Buy the Dora Explorer Big Wheel instead, my daughter loves it and it's very durable 
 Perhaps these other people had bought the product before they lowered the quality.  My experience with this product is that it does not cut hardly at all.  I threw the item in the trash and bought a ConAir at Kmart which surprisly worked about 20 times better.  My recommendation is DO NOT BUY 
 Very dissappointed in the detail provided on engine rebuilding.  I did not learn a single new method or trick for rebuilding. 
 The case is too small. It just fits the laptop with no place for laptop accessories. Not even for laptop battery. I wouldnt suggest this case  
 After having read and loved Howard Pyle's 1968 Classic Press edition of "The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood" I was quite  disappointed with "The Story of King Arthur and His Knights". Whereas Pyle brilliantly brought his characters to life in "Robin Hood", the characters of "King Arthur" seem flat and lifeless by comparison.  The King Arthur stories read like little more than a description of events; one doesn't really get a feeling of being there while things are happening as in "Robin Hood." The dialogue seems much more realistic in "Robin Hood", but I think there's more to it.  The writing style in "King Arthur"  I'd characterize as prosaic---in sharp contrast to the charming, poetic style of writing in "Robin Hood."  
 Perhaps the worst tribute DVD I have ever seen. Jump cut editing will give you ADD (we're talking literally two-second sound bytes!), the grabs are pointless with very few comedians talking about Pryor getting more than one sentence in before they jump to the next trendy talking head. None of them say anything funny or enlightening either, which is surprising for something that is supposed to be a comedy/tribute DVD.  A handful of Pryor clips from an existing concert (just one) and two short clips from the Richard Pryor show. The sycophantic background laughter at EVERYTHING their interviewees say (and I mean EVERYTHING, it's pathetic) is really grating.  And there's too many terrible comics on here - Margaret Cho, Cedric the Entertainer, George Wallace, Jamie Foxx and a bunch of sub-Martin Lawrence jarheads.  Spend your money on one of his live concert DVDs.  This is rubbish made by people who think they have a sense of humour.  It's a beer coaster. 
 ........from reading Danielle Steel.  Here's the book:  three bachelors meet three women.  They all break up, they all end up happily ever after.  BORING, not one single exciting thing about this book.  I was happy when my lunch break ended so I could go back to work and stop reading.  Yes - we keep reading her because we feel obligated and hope for a better book someday, but I think I'm at the end of my rope with Danielle Steel.  My librarian told me last night they aren't even going to carry any new books of hers.  THAT'S sad 
 I'm a huge Jeffery Deaver fan and until this book had never read one of his tomes that I didn't absolutely love. Bloody River Blues was anything but spectacular in my opinion and it was a struggle to even get to the end.   Character development was fair but not the usual style I've come to enjoy from Deaver. I never really knew John Pellam like an intimate friend and was only given tidbits of information about him. Along the way a few more scraps were thrown out but most seemed unimportant. Subcharacters were also underdeveloped - even the villain was so underdeveloped that when the identity was known it was anticlimactic. One of my favorite characters was the paralyzed cop but his story was often short changed - his doctor could have been developed to give so much more to the story but she never was and it left me lacking enthusiasm for the storyline. And his chanting, nutsy wife could have been fun but again she was almost mentioned in passing and nothing more said.   The main plot was fair but not something that would grab the reader and not let go. In fact, I kept putting this book down and it was difficult to muddle my way through it. The subplots were tossed in with no clear reason behind them. For example, the subplot that has John Pellam trying to sell his own movie script so he can make it into a film himself had me scratching my head and saying, "So what!" I really didn't care and didn't see what relevance it had in the big picture. The other subplots were similar and left me wondering why they took up page space.   Overall this book was just a tad below average but for a Jeffery Deaver book to even be average is a very unusual thing. His books usually grab me from the beginning and I lose sleep trying to finish them. If anything, BLOODY RIVER BLUES put me to sleep! I'd definitely skip this one and read anything else by Deaver.  
 as I did when the criminal's motive was revealed. In the first place, the criminal was totally obvious, yet when the moment of denouement came I was dumbstruck, and not in a good way. I guess sometimes *fiction* is stranger than *truth* in spite of the old cliche.   I greatly, greatly enjoyed the Mrs. Murphy mysteries for the first several books, but all good things must come to an end, and my enjoyment certainly did. After finishing "Sour Puss" I went to my bookshelf and pulled out "Wish You Were Here" and began re-reading it. I was really surprised at how much the series has changed since its beginnings. A good many of the characters have strayed so far from their original characterizations as to be almost brand new people.  Naturally one would expect the characters to evolve as do all people.  I really do miss Harry being at the heart of the town of Crozet...she never should have left the post office.  As always, the animals' observations are the only reason why I continue reading 
 Would the woman writing under Joyce Carol Oates' name these days please return America's greatest living author to us?  Seriously, this was the most unenjoyable, in fact most distressingly bad, book by Oates I've read, among the maybe thirty I have had the utmost pleasure to read.  I don't know what vein Oates is tapping to construct these writings but the prose does not sound like her at all, the stories themselves are unimpressive, unwelcoming, unpleasantly centered on people who do not merit consideration. And worse still, I find this is a trend with Oates these days. I can't think of a single book she's published since Middle Age that has been (yes, strictly in my opinion) any good. The short story in Female of the Species that was called "Madison at Guignol" was perhaps the worst Oates story ever published. (And yes I do understand the connotation of the word "Guignol" in the title.)  Some might accuse me of approaching Oates with preconceived notions and then recoiling when she fails to deliver what I, myself, wanted, but that's not the case. One thing I have always applauded in this author is her chameleon-like ability to cross genre boundaries and create tales so divergent in theme and tone that they could have been the opus of a half-dozen different people. I have avidly read along thru Gothic stories, mysteries, romances, non-genre pieces, novellas, poems, short fiction, novels, literary criticism and plays by Oates, and so I believe I can fairly say I do not stereotype Joyce Carol Oates or expect any one thing from her, but in this case, as much as reporting it pains me, this was a bad book and I can only hope Oates bucks the trend and reaches back into the well of talent the world knows she has, and that her next book(s) will be much better 
 The fault may well be mine, but Conquest's prose style is a bit too dense and opaque for me. I purchased the book expecting to be enlightened; the stated purpose is to examine the "brain-blindfolds" that hinder our ability to accurately perceive the political and historical realities of the world. But through the first two chapters I had to repeatedly re-read sentences to try and decipher the point being made. I gave up at the end of chapter two, feeling like a stupid failure. Judging from other reviews written for the hardback edition, there are more astute readers who enjoyed this book and got something of value from it. Good for them. Maybe one of them could write a translation of it for me, or perhaps publish a Dummies version?   Let me provide a sample sentence, and if you can understand it, then by all means get the book: "One trouble, a nasty one, is that the more civilized attitudes of both left and right tend to spill over into their totalitarian variants, or at the minimum into one-sided tolerations, a preference for the more appealing totalitarians over opponents within their own culture, with whom they actually have far less real substantive disagreement." Want to try again? Here, try this one: "More generally, in Europe under the eighteenth-century monarchism, we run into the disorganized current of ideas considered progressive, as against the stasis and stupefaction of the old regimes - a current jammed with flotsam and jetsam, and one that yet flows today, even after socialism has steamed on to shipwreck."   If you not only understood these sentences but enjoyed them, I applaud you and I weep for me!    
 I love this stockpot.  It has a nice heavy-duty bottom, so food doesn't burn.  The offset handles don't get hot.  Great pot for the money 
 I have had Lyme disease for some time now, and am always interested in treatments that could help keep it at bay.  I tried andrographis, the first of the core protocol herbs that this book suggests, and after three weeks of following the recommended dosage I broke out in hives all over my body.  I have never had an allergic response to anything in my life, so I was quite surprised.  Even after taking benadryl, my face and hands were severely swollen the following day.  I saw three physicians to determine the nature of the allergic reaction, ended up on prednisone for 9 days, and I have since returned the remaining androgaphis bottles I had purchased.  The author did indicate that very rarely people have an allergic reaction, and I suppose I was one of the unfortunates.  I am sure the herb works wonders for some, but please be careful.  I would not have expected to fall into a very rarely category.     
 If you have no other ways to prepare for the exams, you can use this book.  But keep in mind that this is only an overview of the exams, not the actual exams, though the book said the questions were made by the testmakers of the real tests.  The questions inside the tests don't have the same difficulty of the real tests.  The College Board has reserved the real tests from the past to the educators who have access to the resources.  The real exams are much harder.  And I doubt that finishing studying this book will prepare you for the real exams in any way.  
 The information in this book is helpful but not neccessary. I enjoyed reading about elves in this book. There is a lot of info on different regions of humans, which at first I thought would be helpful, but there is too much and it limits the creative process. The art work, and I use the term loosely, is horrid, mostly the dwarves. Do not look at the pictures. All in all I'm glad I didn't pay full price 
 Believe it or not, we watched this movie from beginning to end--just to see if there's ANY redeeming feature. What a waste of time! We've enjoyed all sorts of movies, from the serious to the ridiculous--but this movie is totally pointless. Pointless doesn't even begin to describe it. What a cheap piece of #%$&@%! If you have any appreciation for the art of movie-making, for a good story, for good acting, for provocative ideas, for a good laugh, or even for the sheer entertainment value of the ridiculous, don't spend any money on it. And please, if you have seen it, add your 2 cents here so that fewer people get duped 
 The story was slow, predictable and boring. I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it.  It's a dud in my opinion 
 PROS: 1. John Corey is still a funny, memorable character.  CONS: 1. Very little suspense. The author's use of a doomed character's point of view--switching to third person--to tell the reader all of the hows and whys of the main villain's Dr. Evil-esque plan ("FIRE THE NUKE!"). Then, after we know everything, we get plopped back into the first-person, investigative head of Corey, who doesn't yet have the story solved. The result is predicatable and tedious.  2. The don't-look-behind-the-curtain (gratuitous?) use of the Ted Nash character, who makes a brief appearance at the end...despite having died in NIGHTFALL...and, uh, THE LION'S GAME. Why is Ted's appearance so brief here? Well, he admits to screwing Ms. Mayfield. Naturally, Ms. Mayfield opens fire and fills Ted with bullets. Presumably, Ted's dead for good now.   3. The politics of DeMille's novels has been present in other books, but it's never been this catty. Why is the nuke kook a right-winger? (Hey, why not?) I should have known when the jacket cover said the book "will challenge you to question everything you thought you knew about your leaders and your country." The only thing this book has made me question is how anyone can seriously be more worried about conservatives nuking L.A. and San Francisco than the real terrorists out there...the ones who want to slit throats and post the footage on the web.    4. Continuity problems from how the last book, NIGHTFALL ended...Corey and his wife seem way too disaffected by it all. Yep, they are bothered by 9/11, but they are both working their same jobs, apparently having gotten over the whole sickening coverup (witnessed via videotape) that the "accident" of the TWA flight 800 was really caused by a missile. There is passing reference to this, but not much. Apparently, a guy like Corey doesn't do much soul searching. He just keeps going to work. In realilty, it's hard not to notice that DeMille still doesn't know how to deal with the storytelling hole he got himself in with the last book.  Corey is really all this book has going for it. And, while in his capable hands the world will be saved from kooky nuclear schemes from kooky Republicans, he can't save this book.  I think I'm done with DeMille, for better or for worse 
 John Smiley's book is supposed to be an introductory level book for novice level programmers. At the time it was written, I'm sure it was. However, the book is written around Access 97 and a lot has changed since then. The code simply will not work without patches, work arounds and lots of digging. It takes far more than a novice programmer to figure this one out. It defeats the purpose. If you don't like frustration, find a more recent book. 
 High marks for accompanying the nature of the film well (pure action), but I miss the subtlety of the previous soundtracks.. 
 I've been strugging for a long time to describe The Decemberists in  one phrase in a way that suited me, but an issue of NME a few months ago beat me to the punch - "Like the Arcade Fire if they were from the Renaissance and rubbish". "...Architect" is a good song, but the rest is, for lack of a better word, ass-water. Avoid this album. Hell, avoid this band. 
   This was so messy and Mr. Dorrington so over the top in hi self promotion. YUK.!..my partner and I were disgusted. He and his deceased friend/photographer are the rotten people who enter jungle animal habitats and cause the animals so much stress as to charge at them and these creeps can take photographs and brag-Degenerates for sure.Too damn bad for your buddy. It was obvious this was not quite of the caliber daring/bold/ and challenging as some of Herzogs past films. We have been fans for 20+ years. Looks like he did it for the money and Dorrington rode Herzogs coatails in  a way. Geez..I had just watched March of the Penguins and Wings of Migration and those! are truly documentaries made by film experts. The babbling and rambling on in The White Diamond made me pity Herzog. He did it for the $ maybe.Dorrington yammers on and on in such a disgusting way I suggest you turn the sound off and fast forward to the end shots of the waterfall and the swifts. Hey Dorrington-Who cares about you? Herzog..Get out of California before you rot 
 Yeah they're beaten black and blue cause this is s4!7. I don't have anything against Jack White either; this is just boring. If you would like something that sounds like White Stripes(that's what I was expecting) try the Soledad Brothers 
 totally overrated. felt compelled to write a review because everyone else proclaims this release is perfection and the mix of the year.  disc one is strong and on for the first 4 tracks and then becomes totally monotinous and dull until the closing track which is superb. disc two doesn't move me at all except for its classic intro with orbital.  If you are looking for good stuff for your crate seek out the aforementioned on 12" and don't waste your time buying this.  
 WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE CD, WAS TO ME NOTHING LIKE THE MUSIC IN THE MOVIE. I LOOKED SO FOWARD TO GETTING IT BECAUSE OF LOVING THE MOVIE SO MUCH. THIS CD SOUND TRACK SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS AN AFTER THOUGHT  AFTER THE MOVIE WAS MADE.   NOW IM STUCK WITH IT 
 I imagine there are some useful and perhaps even good ideas here. But the entire text is so self-obsessed that it's hard to see beyond the "travelogue" conceit. Franzosi seems to believe that his story-telling makes the book accessible - but instead it simply makes it annoying. Can one meaningfully go from words to numbers? No doubt the answer is yes. But the techniques for doing so will be best served by a more concise elaboration written by someone with less interest in sharing his stories with what Franzosi seems to imagine as an adoring readership. 
 There was a time when liberalism had a connotation of deep thinking, tolerance, and openness to healthy, civil debate.  No longer.  And HARPER'S is a perfect symbol for all that ails the Left.  To call this magazine "Left leaning" is a farce.  It doesn't lean...it completely, totally, enthusiastically, and blindly tumbles and falls into the "Far Left" swamp.  The tone is often hysterically and shrilly partisan, reflecting the ongoing deafness and disconnection that the leftist media elites have towards the mainstream of America.    The quality of the writing and feature selection has declined precipitously through recent years.  This rag is about as credible now as THE GUARDIAN, NATIONAL ENQUIRER, or, come to think of it, The New York TIMES!  Save your money, LOL! 
 This is a disappointment.  The book, though it meditates on a hot topic (black male sexuality), has no real niche.  It is too anecdotal and uninformed to be a history; too contrived to be a social analysis; and too shallow to be a pointed exploration of the self.  The writing has clarity and verve but no substance.  Near the close the author brags that, in sexual matters, he "developed an aversion to labels" (187).  Too bad.  This book needs a label, broader than "hung" and better defined than a tape measure.  The result?  Pop culture at its most boring 
 THIS ITEM IS SUCH A HUGE HUNK OF JUNK! FIRST OFF THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT AND SECOND OFF THE OUTSIDE TEMP IS ALWAYS OFF BY AT LEAST 12 DEGREES. 
 Now don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Bukowski fan. Post Office is a great novel and Women is pretty damn good also, but this is just awful. If this was his first ever novel, it would never have been published. Bukowski always writes about how he never got anything into print for 25 years and if it was anything like this then I can believe why. Pulp, is just a very bad book. The story is stupid, the plot is a mess, the characters are dumb. The only good thing about it is it's short. It's a shame to read something so bad from someone I used to love to read. Stay well away from this book, you will only be very disappointed 
 I took water temperatures at high, low, and keepwarm. I am at 5200 ft altitude so water boils at about 195. All temps reached 203 and the water was in a rapid boil!I have a small Rival I picked up for $12 and it works great low 190, high 199, and Warm 160 
 Unfortunately, I was made to watch this film in a French class I took. While I could appreciate the fountain and the ridiculous gate, it was infuriating that the camera never moved close enough to see any character's face. It was honestly one of the most boring films I have ever seen. It's difficult to watch a movie where you never really see the characters' faces. 
 I bought this toy for my son and I figured if it turns out too 'girly' I would give it to my niece.    As it turned out, it is definitely not adequae for my son but it is definitely more adequate for my son than my niece!  It has also gender neutral issues.  Let me give a couple of examples and if I have time one day I will give more specifics:  This toy has sophisticated electronics but the design behind it seems lacking.  For example, it will give negative feedback for choosing the wrong answer but I will not give any feedback if you chose the right answer:-)  The toy is designed to encourage vanity and other undesirable traits and feels like it was designed by someone who has a sterotypical and negative view of what American girls are like.  More later got to go..  Probably designed by some insensitive backward male out there..  And my apologies to all the good guys out there.  I know there are a lot of you out there and I am married to one of them:-)    
 This terrible and dull album launched the career of Über-nothing violinist, Vanessa Mae.  It is hard to describe the depth of the level to which this album stoops to be "popular". Low brow? You bet! Exploitative? Oh yeah! Dumbed down Classical Music? Well, that's what we've got here!  Value of this album? Hard to say. I am sure that Vanessa's parents and agent are happy with this prosaic product.  Very dumbed down dumb music - for the legions of philistines and musically naive of the world.     In one word, a "dud". 
 If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever. What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.  McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore. 
 This had a lot of basic information on ADD, but it wasnt very interesting. It didn't offer a lot of practical help either. Most of what was in it I already knew. I don't recommend this book. 
 They keep saying that the American public is not stupid, yet they seem to be buying these books. And if this spewing of hatred is not godless, I don't know what is. 
 As a rule, I like the Seche products.  This polish thinner did not work for me and was a true disappointment.  I wasted my money on this one 
 Very poorly written unless you already understand the topic.  Book is heavy on poorly explained theory and provides very little in the way of practical applications or examples.    Far too many errors that even the errata card doesn't address 
 I found Dorrell's frequent asides about his personal experience as a struggling gallery owner to be self-indulgent and unnecessary. Some of these sections got almost too personal. Dorrell's overall tone was jaded, then  self-congratulatory on his finally realized successes. I also found that his advice was exactly contrary to that of another writer of a book I found on this site. I recommend "How to Survive and Prosper As an Artist" by Caroll Michels instead of this book. I think Michel is far more upbeat and serves the interest of the the reader/artist; whereas Dorrell thinly disguises his self-interest as a gallery owner 
 This book is a general discussion of life's hardships in a heavily scriptual context.  It has very little to do with the problems encountered by singles in day to day life.  The author apparently considers herself an expert on being single due to a recent break-up with a fiance in her mid twenties.  Unfortunately, her experience is not particularly relevant to people who have been single for many years or are single in their 30's or 40's, which is significantly different from being a single 20-something 
 Don't buy this edition. Get the first edition, put together by the original editors, G.S. Kirk and J.E. Raven (ISBN 0521091691), which is readily available through Amazon. The current edition has been hopelessly corrupted by M. Schofield, who has edited out crucial fragments in order to support his own "Analytical Philosophy" take on the Presocratics. As an example, he has removed crucial fragments which link Parmenides with the Pythagoreans.   So make sure you acquire the 1st Edition of this crucial sourcebook which was edited in an honest fashion by G.S. Kirk and J.E. Raven, and ignore any later edition which has been corrupted and invalidated by M. Schofield.  Also, take a look at Peter Kingsley's trilogy of books on Parmenides and Empedocles: "Reality," "In the Dark Places of Wisdom," and "Ancient Philosophy, Mystery, and Magic: Empedocles and Pythagorean Tradition." These books will give you the real fragments, and provide you with a real take on why scholars with the intellectual dishonesty of an M. Schofield will rewrite and even abandon the original texts in order to further their own misguided agendas. 
 Some of the Reacher novels--such as The Killing Floor--have been incredibly good, but I was genuinely disappointed in this one.  The author describes Reacher as heroic, a loner, etc., but instead he should write in such a way that we reach these insights without being told.  Phrases, such as "back in the day," get repeated much too often.  Reacher has become a caricature of himself 
 This book is tortorous to read. I'm reading it for a class i currently have and i have to say i'm probably never going to pick it up agian. the whole book is like one big run on sentence with small breaks now and then. its got no order, i feel like it jumps around. not a good read. I'd discourage anyone from buying it. unless you like run on sentences 
 I am a cartoon, and a comic fan.  I have been for years.  I think it is great that marvel has finally started putting out some great cartoon movies to show us in motion what these heroes can do.  The first Ultimate Avengers was cartoon-violent at times, but I thought that is was ok for my 5 year old daughter to watch.  But the second Ultimate Avengers, I thought this one took it a little too far.  There is a lot of hacking and slashing, a lot of really brutal fight scenes, and not alot of the Avengers.  Usually hero violence is punching the badguy out, or throwing him through a wall, but in this film they are trying to kill, and that is hard to watch with a child in the room.  I watched it once with my daughter, and ended up covering her eyes for portions of this film.  For me, I kinda liked it, but I won't watch it very often.  For my daughter, I wouldn't want her to watch it again 
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 This seems to be a converted thesis to book, not the worst job but certainly without much effort.  I'm not surprised its not in stock.    
 There must be some movie buffs out there who like this film for whatever reason, like it enough that this movie has been classified as a "cult classic" of sorts. Obviously this is a candidate for inclusion in the Criterion Collection, they have a cross selection of everything from the works of Bergman, Antonioni, Fellini, Godard to the bottom pit of hell with Michael Bay's The Rock and oh dear god, Armageddon! The Man Who Fell to Earth is therefore prime Criterion fare, but is the film itself any good?  Nicolas Roeg is truly a pale imitation of a director. Has he ever made a satisfying film that was not deeply flawed? This David Bowie vehicle is no different with it's oh so 70's mileau. I especially love how time changes throughout the film, you see characters getting older except Bowie who is an alien. Decades pass and the characters age but we are still in the 1970's! Awesome, really!  It goes without saying that this film is another of Roeg's many exercises or rather fixations on the concept of alienation and modern malaise, capitalism, consumerist spending, etc. That these ideas are packaged so blatantly, ( the movie about alienation with an alien! ), and ineptly is shocking to connoisseurs of fine art cinema. If you want to watch great films about the concept of alienation in the modern world, there is no better director than Michaelangelo Antonioni with L'avventura, La Notte and L'eclisse for starters. Nicolas Roeg by compasion is painfully incompetent.  The best part of this film is it's sense of humor, it can be funny in a tacky, empty sort of way. Plus we get lots of nudity and sex, so that's fun, supposedly. Directors by the 1970's were over the whole censorship of the preceding decades and had as much nudity and sex in their art-house movies as possible, because lots of sex and nudity equals profound insight into the human condition! Right? Ugh...   The DVD is high-quality Criterion Collection work, but the quality of the movie is your call. I find it to be utter junk but worth a look, you may have a different opinion after this pretentious mess robs you of 2 hours and 20 minutes of your life. Nicolas Roeg is a fraud, we have to face up to it 
 Generally I like Deaver's novels - and the premise of this one sounded interesting. But he's in over his head this time. Anyone who has spent more than a few hours online can see that the writer doesn't really understand what he's talking about. By the end of the book I was just reading it to finish it - and the end wasn't worth doing that.  If you have to read a Deaver novel, do yourself a favor and go re-read "The Coffin Dancer" instead 
 Where's the subtitle of this very effective book?  Did the modern editors simply take it away?  Darwin titled his book: "The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection" and subtitled it: "The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life."  When Hitler came to power in 1933, he had one overarching idea in mind: his radical Nazi racial philosophy built on the Darwinian principle of natural selection.  Hilter thought the Aryans were the fittest and he wanted to help speed up the "inevitability" of natural selection.  He first started off with the sterilization of nine categories of "the unfit" which were feebleminded, schizophrenia, manic depression, Huntington's chorea, epilepsy, hereditary body deformities, deafness, hereditary blindness and alcoholism.  He then worked his way up to attempting the complete extermination of entire categories and entire races of people.  Speaking of modern day little Hitlers, the Columbine High School shooters carried out their bloody rampage on Hilter's birthday, April 20th, and had planned on causing more than 500 deaths at the high school.  Shooter Eric Harris had written on his website, "YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE??? Natural SELECTION!  It's the best thing that ever happened to the Earth.  Getting rid of all the stupid and weak organisms."  After the bloody rampage, Harris' autopsy report revealed that he was wearing a T-shirt with the words "Natural Selection" emblazoned on the front.  Beware of those who hold this book dear to their hearts.  This book is not about man descending from the apes.  The ideas in this book have caused and continue to cause more deaths than any other notion in modern history 
 ...on a regular basis.  After each mission, you get rated, one might think that a strategy guide would not only show you all the ins and outs, of a mission, but also how to get the 100% rating for it.  There was sadly, very little useful information in this book.  The maps and locations of things are nice, but that's pretty much where you have to put the book down and play the game on your own.    The book is setup for all the platforms that SC-CT appears on, but what the writers didn't take into account is how the game differs on each platform.  Whoever wrote it, didn't play it on the Xbox, because the things he writes about, don't work in a normal setting.  For instance, they never mention that the ambient sound levels drop as you progress in difficulty.  Or they promote the use of your lethal attacks when that hurts your score.  Not that it even gives good strategic advice there.  When it mentions the cargo ship, it tells you to knock out the second of two guards in a hallway, and when the first guard turns around to see what's going on, you have a moment to shoot him.  It never mentions that you could just shoot out the three lights in that area and silently grab each guard while they are standing around in the dark with no flares.    There are so many different paths in every mission, it is hard to cover them all.  There are also a lot of things in each mission that don't change.  For instance, it's always better to capture a guard and interrogate him, rather than sniping him from some distance off.  Either hack everything you can or get a guard to open it for you.    Splinter Cell has always been a detail oriented game, lots of little things to pay attention to.  To get the most enjoyment and playability out of this game, you can't go through any of the missions with your guns blazing.  I only bought this because I was hoping to find out how to finish the Bathouse mission with 100%, and it didn't even help me do that 
 This is a lousy "Greatest Hits" compilation.  It fails to include the #1 I Just Wanted You Know, #3 Your Love Is A Miracle, among other top 5-10 hits meaning you'll still have to go through and buy the rest of the albums to truely have "the greatest hits".  All together, Id say its missing about 6 tracks needed to be a true "Greatest Hits".  It does include a couple of new songs and one is pretty good which is the only reason I can give this album two stars instead of one 
 I don't know why I keep buying these books - they are just so mediocre.  Boring and formulaic doesn't begin to describe it.  It took it with me on vacation and didn't even bother to bring it home to resell 
 Wow.  This movie's bad.  But it's good for a laugh if you're in the mood for some brainless fun.  Patrick Bergen gives one of the great over-the-top performances of all time as the psycho husband.  Among the many major plot holes:  Hubby smacks Julia because he thought she was checking out their new neighbor on his boat.  Then a few days later he's arranging for them both to go sailing with the same guy, on his boat!  (Wouldn't the psychotically jealous husband try to keep his wife away from the man he thinks she's lusting after?)  Also, the fact that she would fake her drowning in the OCEAN - but flush her wedding ring (halfway) down the TOILET - is not the smartest move to say the least.  Might wanna just ditch that ring in the ocean while you're faking your own death next time, Julia!  Gotta admit though, I loved that the psycho hubby would sneak into Julia's house and actually take time to rearrange the cans in the cupboard before he hides.  What a neat freak.  The final plot hole involves her new boyfriend in Iowa, who would likely be more interested in Patrick Bergen than Julia, if you know what I'm saying 
 LOUSY!!!!  The handle design makes the Cuisipro grater extremely difficult to hold.  There is a BIG space between the drum and the hopper and big pieces of cheese fall through. I grate a lot of cheese, and I am sorry I bought THIS grater 
 This product seemed like a good idea.  I mix my own cereal, and add lots of nuts and seeds.  So it is a lot heavier than the fruit loops that are always shown in the pictures.  The way that the holder fits into the base is not at all secure, and when full of heavy cereal, disaster is assured.  Also, neither the top or the bottom cover is a really secure seal, so tipping the holder caused the top to fly off for me, and some interesting times for my dogs cleaning up the floor.  I had a hard time taking the bottom seal off when my cereal bowl was in position. If you take it off first, then some cereal leaks out, causing the problem I was trying to solve - namely no cereal laying around my counter inviting unwelcome guests.    I tried this product for awhile, but threw it in the trash pretty fast.  Went back to a big tupperware container  Not as convenient as this could have been, but no awful spills either 
 Overall, the book is fairly well written and easy to follow.  The recommendations (dietary and other) would probably be helpful...if indeed your problems are due to elevated cortisol levels.  However, on pgs. 78-79, the author makes the serious mistake of discouraging the use of hormone testing to determine actual cortisol levels.  Instead, he recommends that you use his questionnaire (pg. xvi) as your sole guideline.  Unfortunately, most of those questions deal with general stressors which nearly everyone experiences, along with other general health related questions.  The point is, anyone could get a high score on this questionnaire, including those with high cortisol; low cortisol; fibromyalgia; chronic fatigue syndrome, and any number of other ailments.  This creates a very serious problem, because if someone with low levels of cortisol (common in CFS, for instance) were to take some of the supplements that the author recommends, that person's already weak adrenal glands would be depleted even further, with potentially catastrophic consequences.  So, my recommendation is to read this book with an open mind, but definitely get your cortisol levels tested (contrary to the author's opinion, salivary cortisol testing has proven quite reliable) before using any of the herbs or other supplements suggested. 
 In 1991, Twista came out and got into Guinness, then in 1993 B.O.N.E. released Faces of Death and then the classic EP "Creepin on ah come up" in 1994. I honestly think Twista and other chitown rappers didnt steal Bone's style because even though theyre both fast, bone harmonizes their flow, while twista harshly spits his. This album is a clear cut example of how Three 6 Mafia used Bone's style to come up. This album was originally released in 1995 and each of the members of the group sound almost identical to the Bone members. If you want my opinion, Three 6 used Bone's style to come up in the business and that is evidenced through the fact that in Three 6 today. "Stay Fly" and "Poppin My Collar" sound nothing like "Live By Yo Rep", all being good songs. Look at that to comparison with Bone ,, "East 1999" and "Thuggish Ruggish Bone" sound very similar to Bone's appearances in "Ridin", "Spit Yo Game", "Dont Forget About Us", and their solo work 
 First off, I am an avid reader and love a long challenging read, however, this novel is one of the worst I have ever read! It is long, boring and has absolutely no plot. I purchased it when it first came out without reading any reviews. Although from the looks of most of them here, I personally suspect that many of those who raved, never actually read the book 
 Thomas Frank's argument in this paper is somewhat true; those who live in rural areas tend to vote Republican, seemingly against their economic interests.  What we see is an overstatement by Frank in many areas.  The first is the stereotype (widely used by Frank) that those who reside in rural America are ignorant, "delusional," "beer-guzzling," uneducated individuals.  This is very far from the truth.  There are a number of economic reasons why rural Americans SHOULD vote for Republicans. 1.  The poorness of rural Americans is overstated.  People that study these cleavages, such as Jeffrey Stonecash, contend (correctly) that the "economic struggle in areas have been exaggerated."  This is due to the ultraliberal rejection of the relative cost of living.  Which will cost more: living in northern New Jersey, or living in Wyoming?  Obviously in New Jersey, where almost everything (except for maybe Haagen-Dazs) is more expensive. 2.  Rural self-images are not readily understood by liberals.  Many rural residents are either self-employed or work under few people.  This results in an emphasis on individualism and self-gain, which is a tenet of economic conservatism.  Additionally, which goes along with the lack of poorness argumet, rural Americans are much more likely to own land and therefore are supportive of Republican measures that help landowners.  Jeffery Stonecash, who has widely studied the ideas of the split between groups in American society, completely omits this from his book, "Split."  This is not to say that Stonecash has completely ignored the issue, because his article "The Rural Side of the Urban-Rural Gap" studies the issue in-depth and actually refutes Frank's narrow and hasty argument.  The assumption that Republicans have victimized rural Americans and duped these poor "suckers" into voting for them is absolutely atrocious.  What has happened since the 1960s (with the civil rights movement and evangelical movement) and especially since the early 1980s (with the emergence of Ronald Reagan and his emphasis on cultural issues, particularly abortion and traditional family values) is a greater emphasis on cultural rather than class issues.  Class issues (defined by economics) have remained generally the same and the views on these has not changed much among the parties.  Cultural issues, on the other hand, tend to polarize voters more.  The differences in rural and urban voters cannot be attributed to economics alone.  Women in rural districts are less likely to vote, so there is less voting for Democrats.  There are fewer minorities in rural areas, so Democratic votes are lower.  There are fewer secularists in rural America, so voting for Republicans is higher.  From these arguments we can see that economics is not the only force driving rural Americans to vote for Republicans.  The emergence of cultural, rather than class, issues have caused a shift in votes to the Republicans in rural districts.  In some cases, the Republican party actually is MORE attractive to rural landowners who have a sense of individualism 
 This CD is NOT Flamenco! I'm not sure exactly what to call it, but it is not Flamenco. And half the time the guy hits some really off-key notes. I would not recommend this CD to anyone. If you want to hear some great guitar music by someone who knows how to play the guitar, try music by the guitarist known as Pavlo 
 This book is written in an engaging fashion for younger readers, so that's why I gave it 2 stars. But I found the attitudes conveyed towards slavery, Native Americans, and Democrats unsettling. I think there are some political motives behind this book. I think the author is trying to indoctrinate youngsters into ultra-conservative Southern Republican political ideas, and a brand of Christianity that makes people outside the church (you know, the OTHER people God loves) think Christ-followers are hateful and crazy.   For example, on p36 it states, "Although it is true that Native Americans were often treated badly by European settlers, they treated one another worse" and "We cannot feel so much pity for the Native Americans when we think of all this." Did they have it coming? They faught and killed each other like every other group of humans on the planet, so we shouldn't feel bad about the injustices perpetrated by white European settlers that the Natives have never recovered from?  And on the two pages that deal with slavery, it is mentioned that the slave trade was profitable for the traders, but "hard on the slaves" who were shipped to the colonies "under difficult conditions." A bit of an understatement.   And, on the subject of the Civil War, "Many people in the south did not own slaves, but they knew how quickly the Southern economy and standard of living would be damaged if the Northern politicians forced Southern farmers to immediately free their slaves." Yikes, what about the slaves' standard of living? No where is it mentioned or even alluded to that slavery in the US was BAD and WRONG. It's not okay to own another human being and treat him or her like an animal (or WORSE).   The reason the North abolished slavery? They had MACHINES to do the work of slaves, so slaves became obsolete. And I quote, "...why slavery was done away with in the Northern states. The reason is primarily that Northern businessmen did not need slave labor to operate their stores and factories because they made much greater use of the new machines that cut down on the amount of hand labor that was necessary to complete a job." No mention of how compassionate Christians (and others) were vehemently opposed to the way slave owners viewed, kept and treated their slaves, or what they did to abolish slavery.  Finally, the treatment of Democrats and Republicans is really unbalanced. The only things mentioned about Carter? How horrible he was for establishing relations with China, that he messed up with the Panama Canal, and his debaucling of the Iran hostage situation. "In short, our country had sunk to new lows during the Carter years." Clinton's claims to fame are creating a huge government against the Constitution and the will of the people (who promptly reelected him), meddling in Bosnia and other war-torn nations, promoting homosexuality, and Monica Lewinsky. (WHY are these last two issues in a book for 9-year-olds?) In contrast, the Repubs get ONLY positive press in this text.  Finally, the book also says on p178, "Sadly, our country's Supreme Court ruled in 1962 that it was illegal for children to pray in the public schools." That's not true. That law pertains to adult-led corporate prayer, but does nothing to prevent a CHILD from praying in school.  If this book is in line with your political views, then you might want to buy it. But I have a hard time believing that anyone in this day and age thinks SLAVERY was really not such a bad thing. For that reason, no one should by it. This text could be supplemented with something more truthful regarding slavery, like a parent-censored version of "The Slave Narratives," which records hundreds of interviews with former slaves about their lives as slaves and after emancipation. 
 I wanted a monitor for digital photography that was a little better than the bottom end offerings.  I decided on the Viewsonic.  When I received it there was a permanent green pixel right in the middle of the display, and a 3/8" light banding strip at the top.  Amazon was VERY helpful with the return process, even covering the return shipping.  It seems that bad pixels in new monitors can be considered 'normal', but right in the center is unacceptable.  I have seen this monitor in operation, and as long as there are no pixel problems, it looks great 
 Being a big Russell Banks fan, I was very much looking forward to reading The Darling, a book that addresses a subject matter that is clearly a departure for Banks.  I wish he'd stuck with trailer parks and the rural working class. The only reason I finished the book was because I was so hoping something bad would happen to the heroine.  She is perhaps the least likable, least sympathetic heroine in a book I've ever read. What ever happened to writers writing what they know?  Banks using a woman as a first person narrator was a big mistake. Hannah rings so hollow to me, a supremely self-absorbed, irritating and, in many ways, dangerous person to anyone she encounters. The dialogue throughout -- particularly the trite conversations among the characters about the "sixties" -- was contrived and unreal.  I was immensely disappointed 
 This book was boring beyond belief.  The story was predictable and transparent, and the characters were completely unrealistic.  If you are looking for something to help you sleep at night, this could be a find.  Ohterwise, just pick up the dictionary, which in my opinion is more interesting 
 Considering that the Edith Wharton novel on which this movie is based is a literary masterpiece, I expected more from the filmmaking. I imagined it would be a tasty adaptation  along the lines of the marvelous "Age of Innocence." But this movie disappoints sorely.  For starters, the two lead actors are just plain wrong. The actor playing Lawrence Seldon has an effeminate voice that negates him as a convincing love interest. And as a character, he is dull and conservative, not the thinking, lawyerly man of the world we know from the book.   Other problems with this adaptation: Gus Trenor isn't alcoholic enough; Sim Rosedale isn't Jewish enough. Worse, the actress who plays the tragic Lily Bart is a hollerer. When she's not pouting, she's hollering her lines. The emotional scenes get louder and louder, just when the viewer would be most affected by subtlety. Sashaying prettily out a door in an expensive dress does not replace good acting.  True, the settings are plush and the costumes are wonderful. But the settings are sooo consistantly plush that one wonders where the non-rich people are hiding. In Wharton's novel, there is contrast. Seldon's cousin lived in an unpretentious apartment  and was involved with social work amongst down and out women.   But this movie combines Seldon's  cousin with Grace Stepney, the rich aunt's beneficiary.  So we never see this contrasting life in the movie, and hence, Lily isn't given the opportunity to redeem herself by showing  kindnes to the disadvantaged. And two  important  characters are rolled into one, which eliminates complexity and serves to soap-opera-ize the movie even more.   Good points? I liked the rich aunt. She was believable, despite being situated in a house too rich for her situation. I also liked the Grace Stepney character. With her hair down, she was convincingly heartbroken. And the tour guide girlfriend of Lily's was nicely done. And so were other minor characters, including George Dorset.   It's a shame that the poor editing or poor acting or whatever it was of the two primary characters served to slaughter this tragic drama so pitifully. I had a dificult time  finding the patience to watch it through it to the end.   While people who enjoy soap opera-like historic romances may like this movie,  if you're an Edith Wharton fan, you'll definitely be disappointed. I recommend watching "Age of Innocence" again, and skipping this one 
 This book reminds me of a false advertisement: pick it up and it sounds interesting, even those first crucial lines pull you in and then... Then we are pulled along on a tortuous journey into a writer's ego.  This book is written in the kind of style that you want to be beautiful, even lyrical - Instead it's more often confusing.  By page 17 I was skipping forward in hopes that it became more compelling.  There is a languid air to Mr. Jordan's writing, which is fine as long as we care about what happens or why.  Why the main character is killed by her childhood friend (no suprises, we know the killer's name on page one)is perhaps the clearest paragraph and half of the book. Unfortunately this doesn't happen until page 268, by then I was just glad to be done with it all.  Mr. Jordan's screenplays are wonderful, but this book is pure self-indulgence.  
 Glad I just recorded this from TV, because boredom set in fairly quickly and then I just fast forwarded, and saw the ending. It's now erased. Life is too short to sit through junk like this 
 First let it be said that this book leads you to believe that he hikes the whole trail... He does not. He hikes less than a third. You dont find this out until 2/3 through the book, which is right about when the book goes from passibly bad, to an ill effort to fulfill a contract.   My conclusion on this book is that he was contracted to hike the trail by his publisher, could not, and stuffed the remainder of the book with verbatum history lessions and whole cloth inserts of useless statistics.   As others have said in this review forum. This book can be snide, highschoolish and down right mean. I fail to see the "wit" in his endless negitivity and bashing.   This book has a few funny parts, but I cant help but feel that it is a huge exageration of real events, and is mostly contrived fictional accounts which he uses to air is nasty comments. It is so unbelievible in places, that you know you are on an imagined tangent.   Dont waste your money or time. I am so happy I bought it for 25 cents at a yard sale! 
 If you are afraid that sociopaths are learning effective ways to kill ,then this book will put your fears to rest. One of Minnery's suggestions is to find out what hotel room your target is staying in. Then rent two  hospital X-ray machines and position them in the two rooms adjacent to the  target's room. Aim them through the walls at his bed and crank them on. The  target will die of leukemia. The only practical method in his entire How To  Kill series was Hatchet To The Medulla. If these books were required  reading for every would-be killer in America the homicide rate would drop  considerably 
 Beautifully illustrated book and perfect for dumbing down your child. Imagine silly Elmo, role model, talking about bedtime. Elmo has little to offer in this book. My daughter isn't allowed to and doesn't come up with 100 things she must do before going to bed. Why let Elmo teach her to stall or manipulate? If I read this book to her, she may need to check under the bed, water the plants, open the window and look outside, feed the fish, run out of the room to check to see if the water was left running, check to make sure the cap is on the toothpaste, close the window, et cetera before going to bed.  I have a collection of now over 300 children's books and this one just doesn't offer much. There are so many better books out there--many classics which are engaging and silly, but ALSO teach kids lessons on HOW TO LIVE AND ACT.  Often both parents are working these days and there is less time that they are around to teach their children about morality and how to live. Why waste time with this book? Even that purple dinosaur has more to offer 
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 I got this book because when faced with a new situation or task my first response is often "I can't do that." I was looking for somthing to help me know that I CAN (because I can).  So far, this book isn't it. I'm only halfway through and probably won't finish, because I'm not finding what I need here.  If I needed to know about different kinds of guilt, or about love, or if I needed to know about the "sexist attitude of society" that has "placed labels on women which must be overcome if a woman is to be treated as a person and not a sex object", or "If a young woman has poor self-esteen, she will often marry the first man who comes along" this book would be great. But as far as helping me to be a more confident person, not great 
 Yes this does have 20 packets of baby food in it, but they are extremely small...about the size of a sweet n low pouch 
 If you bother to parse the author's execrable writing, you find that he has very little to say about whatever it is French people do to avoid obesity.   Instead, he goes off on tangents. He tells cutesy anecdotes about family members that probably aren't even interesting to his other family members. Having established the the French are more inclined to eat organic produce and natural-sourced food than Americans, he then fills PAGES with irrelevant (and dumbed-down) factoids about chemicals in food.  If (as he says) the French aren't big on surgical solutions to obesity (e.g., stomach stapling and liposuction), why has he included an entire rambling chapter on them?  In fact, you might wonder how how someone as apparently incapable of getting to the freaking point as Clower got a PhD.    But if he just stuck to the point, he wouldn't have a book--he'd have a short, not-well-supported essay suitable for peddling to one of the less-renumerative ladies' mags.  Unsurprisingly, he sticks to the hard-to-quantify, touchy-feely (and generally useless) explanations for how the French stay thin and avoids mentioning the one contributing factor that most epidemiologists agree on: The French smoke like chimneys 
 Very bizzare movie! Not for kids or anyone who is prudish! Can be an erotic movie if you choose to see through the bizzare nature of it 
 If I didn't know any better, I'd swear this was a book written by a Satanist. The author seems to be rejoicing in the prospect of armageddon, including mountains being blown up and the destruction of all the world's cities. I bought a tatty copy for one penny and I was somewhat surprised to see that by 1973 it was on its 27th printing. It seems reasonable then to assume that Mr Lindsey's views are fairly representative of mainstream America.   If that's the case then that suggests that plenty of Americans are keen for armageddon to erupt in the Middle East so that the "good Christians" may be whisked off for a private audience with J. Christ while the rest of the population burns.   I would recommend this book to all Israelis. In his book The Last Days of Israel, Zionist author Barry Chamish declared that Israel's main enemies were European Socialists. Well, I reckon that Hal Lindsey and his fans present a greater threat. It seems likely that if the supposed Temple of Solomon is not rebuilt and Israel isn't annihilated then a lot of committed Christians are going to be most upset. The bit of "good news" in Lindsey's book is that the surviving Israelis will convert to Christianity with such passion that they will be like "144,000 Billy Grahames".   It seems that committed Christians are in charge of both the UK and US governments and that the US government could be described as a theocracy. I wonder if the theocrats share the views of Mr Lindsey, who states in this book that each Arab generation hates Israel more than the one before, which would be good news as it would mean that they would be more likely to attack and initiate armageddon and cause the return of Jesus Christ.  Russia is portrayed as the villain of the book, but "Red China" and the "Red Chinese" get a look-in in a chapter entitled "The Yellow Peril".   The book however does contain one true statement, on page 120: "Religion is a great blinder of the minds of men." and frankly, I hope "the rapture" does happen soon. The sooner that people like Hal Lindsey are whisked off the face of the Earth, the greater the likelihood for peace in the world 
  Kim is nothing but a publicity tramp with no class or style. Please stop buying her albums b/c to me, it sounds like stereo porn. Great female MCs to check out: Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Roxanne Shante, even Salt N Pepa. What do they have in common? They were pioneers who didn't sell music with horrible lyrics and had class at the same time. So don't buy any of Kim's records and get something from the ladies I listed above. So now, your stereo system should be playing the right music 
 When I first heard Venus Isle, I thought "not nearly as good as Ah Via Musicom"...but it IS Eric Johnson, so I gave it a chance.  After a few listens, the album started growing on me.  Unfortunately, after about 10 listens, I can't stand it.  What eventually killed me is the AWFUL lyrics that over-pepper a couple of songs and literally make up the rest.  If I had read the latter without knowing who wrote them, I would've guessed they were written by a pretentious grammar school student...a pubescent, bisexual girl in the throes of puppy love ("I still feel the same, all about you...'cause your the king of hearts").  Considering Eric's strong/veteran background and the fact that, after absorbing all his previous material, I know of what he's capable, the music on most of the songs with lyrics is weak, too.  I can't give more than 1 star for an album on which I have to fast-forward through the majority of the songs just to get to the solos. "Camels Night Out" (instrumental) is particularly boring and, as a fan/consumer/guitarist, I'm disappointed that Eric published it. Love the tone, but...  Speaking of solos, there are some good ones (nothing on the caliber of, let's say, "Desert Rose"), but many are way too "scholastic".  On too many songs, Eric just half-heartedly samples through a few scales instead of really going off until capturing something special or spending the time to craft an appropriate/memorable solo.    Even though there was over 5 years between AVM and this, VI was obviously still rushed (despite it's high production level). Hindsight being 20/20, I would have borrowed it only to burn "Manhattan", "SRV" and "Pavillion" to an EJ compilation CD...just these 3 songs are not worth the $20 I spent to aquire this album 
 It is small and light weight, probably perfect for hikers. I think the battery is supposed to last 5-8hrs away from the car. The software is pretty versatile and it lets you do a lot. My biggest complaint is that it is very slow. I'll be typing in a name to help filter my destination choices, and if it is more than 5-10 miles away, it takes forever for it to show up. I end up not knowing if the destination (say McDonalds) doesn't exist nearby, or if I just spelled it wrong. Additionally when I pass up a turn I don't want to make, it goes into "Recalculating...". Then it finishes in time to tell me to turn right just as I'm driving through the intersection...."Recalculating..." again. I think she does it on purpose. This product would probably be fine for anyone who drives at half the speed limit 
 This is one of the worst books in the world---in my humble opinion!  OK, I'm in the minority.  Most of the reviewers LOVED the book.  I think this book is a waste of beautiful words!  Yes, Conrad had a beautiful English vocabulary.  But, the "story" is "encrusted" with so many words you'll tire of it after awhile. OK, try the book, but now, at least, you won't feel as I did,  "What's wrong with ME that I don't like this book."  You won't feel "alone" in your reaction.  I think "Heart of Darkness" is a much better book.    Comments?   boland7214@aol.  PS:  As of 1-15-07 I see that I have ZERO "yes" votes for my review.  That's "mean".  I'm just giving my honest reaction.  You don't have to agree with me but why not give me a break for spending the time and energy just to write my thoughts----thoughts which MIGHT help someone....maybe not you....but someone.  Thanks.  
 I was hoping for something much more layman in explaining the great quantum physics. It is not an easy read. I have found other books that were more easy to read on the subject 
 I picked up this book for two reasons. First, the main character, Cyn, was in the advertising business. Second, I thought the premise sounded interesting. Cyn takes over another women's identity, who has wronged her in the past. I was pretty disappointed on both fronts. The whole advertising business aspect wasn't very realistic, even for a chick-lit book. As far as the plotline goes, the author tried way too hard to make Cyn likable. I ended up hating her because she was so gosh darn nice. The whole identity-stealing sounded great, but came out pretty lame as well. A below par fluffy read 
 This is a poorly researched and badly written attempt to cash in on The Da Vinci Code phenomenon.  It dishes up its so called insights into the Da Vinci Code like an overcooked pasta with a tomato sauce straight out of the can.  And as a travel guide it is next to useless.  
 Generic lyrics kill this album. Nothing separates this band from so many others that are coming out 
 Blech!  I really like all the young actors that were in this movie and expected it to be really funny and cute.  WRONG!  It was a bizarre combination of shock tactics trying to show how edgey they all were.  The only redeeming actor was Justin Long.  The rest of the movie was a waste of brain cells 
 Back in the beginning of the extreme music genesis, these guys were one of the pioneers of extreme music.  They certainly weren't any of the forms of extreme metal and they certainly weren't punk.  Unfortunately, they were put into the alternative category which was a catch-all for music that was basically pop while supposedly rejecting the "mainstream sound".  That's right The Butthole Surfers were stuck in the category that cursed the world with Nirvana / Nine Inch Nails / Ministry / Smashing Pumpkins garbage.  Oh, that reminds me, it cursed the 80s with all those hideous Sub-Pop label bands.  Still there were a few "alternative" bands that were quite good.  Only the Surfers and Big Black come to mind though.  Their live shows were incredible.  Flashing movie clips flashed strange scenes in the back ground including sex change operation footage.  The singer constantly lit his hand on fire for some reason (as if it were a big dangerous stunt), naked women danced on stage, and a certain song they used a huge tuba.  Their two best albums were Hairway to Steven and Locust Abortion Technician but some of the earlier ones could be considered as good as these two.  There song styles varied from song to song.  They would have crazy fast songs such as Human Cannonball or really slow drugged out songs such as 22 going on 23 with a depressed radio talk show clip played in the background.  They would also utilize oriental sounds modified in their own weird style on the classic Kuntz(spelling).  We also got the weird rantings on "Johnny Smokes" who was a "crippled midget lesbian boy who stood ten foot tall WITH A KNIFE!"  Well, they got to be pretty popular and appeared on the alternative music fest tour Lollapalooza and soon after actually got signed to a major label.  The last I heard probably over 10 years old was some songs off of the major label release "Independent Worm Saloon".  They had seriously sold out their style degenerating in a more acceptable mainstream sound.  I hadn't paid attention for these many years but recently checked out this Weird Revolution.    This has got to be one of the most extreme sell-out jobs ever.  I can't think of a worse bit of conforming to please mainstream record labels hoping for success.  I have seen plenty and most of them quite bad but I honestly can't think of any that tops this.  This is the kind of pumping technopop you see in bad movies.  What happened?   I am not aware of how popular these guys have become or not but it is one of the saddest falls of a great band I have ever known 
 I watched as much as I could stand on PBS before concluding this was not a classic 19th century novel unknown to me but a poor recent imitation, and came online to verify that.  Anyone who is enjoying watching this has presumably never seen anything based on a really good novel, like those by Dickens, Dumas, or even Wilkie Collins. What ****!  I refuse to waste my time even to see it through to the end.  This is only for people in the current generation raised to observe frequent violence rather than intelligent plot and conversation.  It is not terrible, but not worth watching if you have anything at all worth doinng with your time 
 Not a spy thriller, but a novel about self-absorbed middle-aged men who happen to be former spies. Which is fine, except the book is sold as a thriller, and the blurb is full of praise for the "tension" and "pace". Talk about false advertising! The story really only gets going in the last 70 pages or so, and then it suddenly ends without any resolution.  Even considers as a character study with no pretensions as a spy thriller, this book disappoints. It's far too full of annoying "What-ho old chap" overgrown "public" (i.e. private) schoolboys, and the main characters are totally unsympathetic; Cranmer is a sad sack, Pettifer (encountered only in flashback) is a narcissistic boor, and Emma (likewise only seen in flashback) is a vacuous airhead.  Thirty years ago, Le Carre might have taken this premise and made something worth reading out of it. Once every hundred pages or so, there is a flash of his former skill, which only makes the book more disappointing 
 From a parents view I definetly thought this sequel was violent compared to the first one.  We saw this at the the theater, and almost had to leave. If your expecting this to be just like the first one, you'll be upset.  For a  family with young children, I would suggest renting this before you buy it 
 The TeleZapper has been a very poor substitute for Ameritech's Privacy Manager which worked 100% of the time. The Telezapper may have reduced some of the Telemarketing calls but it has definitely not eliminated them and we've had it for months. I'd recommend looking into alternatives before buying a TeleZapper 
 I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this book, was yet another dread.  The instructions were, at times unclear, and my result was not up to par.  Though the pictures are astounding, especially the cover picture, don't let your eyes, or your tastebuds longing for the food, decieve you 
 Bought it for school.  Enjoyed the other books I bought, but this one put me to sleep.  Written more for a professional academic or corporate board member (I enjoy much more pragmatic books) 
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 This little book sounded like just what I could use in running a group of "Primetimers" at church...having socials I mean.  It is not very cleverly written.....and I will probably get rid of it 
 I just got my hands on this book for my master program study. From just reading a couple of chapters, I can see where this book is going. It is clear that the book was published in a rush, and never reviewed properly. The author takes too much time struggling to explain the theory, and when it comes to the example, author simply tells that its obvious, although the theory behind is explained in at least 3 pages. Also, the amount of mistakes I found in this short period is enormous and unbarebale. You start to get lost when following the example and feel you can move forward.   My advise for you, if you are not obliged to buy this book, then don't do so, specially if you look at the price of it 
 I would not recommend this video and wonder why it got so high reviews from other people.  The pace is way too fast and they change positions very often.  It was hard for me to keep up with all of the different positions as an adult.  I couldn't imagine how kids could.  The kids on the video must have practiced for at least a year so they could all be in sync.  I would recommend "Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids" by Rich Grogan if you are wanting a work out that kids can actually keep up with and is fun 
 Hair Rules is good if you know absolutely nothing about taking care of your curly or kinky hair. Dickey excels at giving general advice and information about products and simple maintenance, but if you're looking for detailed instructions on how to style your hair at home, this is NOT the book for you.  Dickey refuses to recommend any specific products (not even brands), so this book is even less useful than, say, a monthly women's magazine such as Essence or Shape.  Also, the photos are mostly black and white, and lack any kind of detailed captions and close-ups that would help readers replicate these styles at home.  Borrow it from the library or buy it used. 
 False Doctines from the pit of hell 
 One of the worst movies i've ever seen, no real plot and acting is as bad as it can get. Not even Samuel Jackson's appearance saves this sorry excuse for a movie. Horrible. Awful 
 Scratches, loose screws that cannot be tightened, and poorest quality ever!  Shockingly inferior in every way 
 "Awkward" and "provincial" wrote the NY Times reviewer, and I can't disagree. To get an idea of the biographer's  perspective on Kinsey, consider that he refers to an interest in S/M as  "peculiar," and closes by predicting that had the atheistic  Kinsey lived to see the age of AIDS, he would have seen AIDS as the work of  a "wrathful God.&quot 
 It is very disappointing to have 40 pages of paper and only be able to print a little over half that number with the cartridge that comes with it. I now have three unopened packages of paper that I have no cartridge for. I think we should be able to buy just the cartridge when we need to. It sure would be nice. That is why I am only rating one star. Otherwise, it would have been a five....  Thanks, Marsh 
 The cover bouquet is the only thing worthy and inspiring out of all the arrangements.  Most are plain with only one or two different kinds of plants in them.  And even the few that has more variety still looks ordinary and not that pretty.  Sigh, at least the cover is really good to look at 
 Why is it that every Disney channel actor has to try to become a pop star? Raven, your songs are boring and meaningless, but you're an awsome actor and if I were you, I'd stick with that. ( Although your song Backflip did turn out to be decent  
 William Dembski is one of the great names in the Intelligent Design-movement.  He holds a Ph.D. in mathematics and philosophy, and have earned grades in theology an psychology. When such a man writes a book and call it "Intelligent Design - The bridge between science & theology" I had great expectations that he had succeeded in making this important bridge.  I think  you can read this book in at least two ways.  One, as an introduction to how the leading people behind this movement think, and for such a presentation I give the book 4 stars.  Dembski is very good at using interesting parables to illustrate his arguments.  But as a bridge between science and theology it is totally failing.  And that is sad because the probability for Intelligent Design is in fact high as Dembski shows us, but Dembski mess it up through most of his book.  As science I give this book 1 star and end up with a compromise at 2 stars.  Dembski uses much space to general logic.  As to show that if you have two similar books containing the same Shakespeare-play, these two books doesn't have any more information together than one of the books alone.  OK. And so what?  After pages with such stuff you begin to be impatience and wonder how and when will all this logical stuff be used to prove Intelligent Design?  And then, as you have waited and waited, Dembski finally writes that it is not space in this chapter (and not in other chapters either)to explain the Big Bang by his Intelligent Design theories.  What a disappointment.  Couldn't he instead have skipped some of the logic?  But after a while you understand that Dembski actually lacks any intentions to reveal the most basic things that normally should have concerned Intelligent Design.  He claims that intelligence leaves behind a characteristic signature in nature, and that these signatures are observable.  Why can't he tell us what this observable signatures are? He writes that God's fingerprints in nature are imperically detectible. But how? Why wont he tell us?   Dembski writes that something is made by intelligence when it can show both complexity and specification.  Ink spelt on a paper can show some complexity in pattern, but it is not specified before the ink spells letters and words with meaning.  He then uses this criteria for intelligent design in nature, and call it science and a proof of Intelligent Design when nature is both complex and specified. But can you prove God this way?  I think you only can believe in Intelligent Design, and that a strong probability for God never fully can prove Him anyway. Dembski does not try to prove God either, he just confirm that God exists because he have seen him in nature as the result of intelligent design.  No one can criticise you for believing in an intelligent designer, but if you want to make this belief into science, it is not enough just to call it science, as Dembski does.  You have to fullfill certain criteria and rules to call something science.  Dembski dosen't follow these rules at all.    Dembski spend much of his time in this book to criticise others for not being scientific, often just because they don't accept Intelligent Design as science.  He says that naturalism is metaphysic, and not science based on evidence.  If he had used his own definitions he uses on others, the Intelligent Design he presents wouldn't either be scientific.      He neither seems to remember what he wrote some pages earlier. After "proving" that Christ was the Logo by which the world was created, he later writes that Intelligent Design not necessarily must have originated from any specifically god at all. Are you confused like me?  An interesting objection to the kind of Intelligent Design that Dembski presents, namely that God interacts and design the nature all the time, is why then He design crippled people, hiv-virus an so on all the time?  Dembski just brush those with such objections off by calling them unscientific. If Dembski instead had advocated that God started it all by "shooting a billiard ball" with a very precision, that interacted with other "balls" that fine-tuned the universe and started the evolution that eventually ended up with the complicated human being, Dembski could have accepted naturalism as well as Intelligent Design, and then nature could have been responsible, at least in some way, for it's mishaps instead of blaming God, as Dembskis theories leads towards, though he denies it.  In this book Dembski claims to represent, among others, the 90 % of the people in the United States who believe that some kind of transcendent force created the world. I believe the same, but fear that books like this more destroy than helps to make a bridge between science and theology.  
 In "Palindromes" Solondz has found another novel way to tell us how miserable and futile life can be. He's great at pinpointing where it hurts, but I think I'm ready to call the doctor.    There's a scene in Preston Sturges' "The Lady Eve" where Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck are on the deck of a cruise ship, and Henry Fonda is staring out over the water saying something like, "I feel like I've known you all my life. I keep meeting you, etc." "Palindromes" stretches that idea over 110 minutes, using a young girl who desperately wants to get pregnant portrayed by eight different actresses.  When she's finally successful, you'll be mumbling to yourself, "This is so wrong. This is so wrong."  Solondz reportedly wanted Heather Matarazzo to reprise her role as Dawn Weiner from "Welcome to the Dollhouse" for this film; when she declined Solondz had her character commit suicide. 
 I understand that we should notice bad things about toxic people, but no one is perfect. This book goes beyond logic, into what seems like a silly rant about behaviors that practically anyone can exhibit on a bad day.  Too over the top, and in laymans terms for me. I honestly regret this purchase. It's a bit cheesy to me, and written in a style that subtly smells of romance novel penmanship 
 I couldn't get past the very stylized dialogue which seemed to coming from the same source although different actors were speaking.  The characters are cliches through and through and does anyone really speak the way the people do? Mamet appears to have never left Manhattan and has no clue to writing non urban roles or a script with enough nuance to delineate his characters perspective.  To be honest I didn't finish the entire film, but instead checked the TV Guide for reruns of Northern Exposure for the real thing 
 This book assumes a lot of time is available to teach students civilized ways of treating others.  It does not serve those of us who teach middle or high school--we generally have 45 minutes per day, are required to complete the text in one year, and have students whose attitudes and habits are almost solidified.  This book has some great ideas which may work in elementary classrooms.  If you teach adolescents, I recommend books by Lee Canter or Randall Sprick 
 Endless collection of the same photograph, same pose, and same lighting showing little imagination.  On the positive side, probably makes a good reference book if you want to take your own photographs.  The black and white format adds nothing and they should have been shot in color.  Add 1.5 stars if you enjoy pictures of nude women and don't really care about the photograph 
 I love star trek but buy the movies seperate from amazon and it will save a lot of money.  this should be a lot cheaper 
 I originally planned to purchase Locin floss to replace the DenTek, but I'm not too pleased with it so far.  PLUSES ======= -Each individually wrapped floss. -Doesn't contain floride.  MINUSES ======= -Flimpsy handle--almost not usable. -Wrap is not 100% sealed. -flossing head is shallower and narrower than the DenTek 
 Although I enjoyed the book for casual reading, it was very short on both pictures and specific plant care info. The authors seem to enjoy commenting on the plants that they have included but 'Passalong Plants' is not for you  if you are looking for technical information.  I wanted it to tell me  specifically how to divide, the best time to harvest passalong plants and  give good drawings/photos of the plants listed.   One of the more  disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon 
 I am an organizational psychologist, and I have been reviewing a lot of bibliography about positive thinking, optimism, depression and related concepts. The very apealing title of Ventrella's book moved me to read it, but I dindn't find what I expected to find. From my point of view, this book by Scott Ventrella has three importantan weaknesses and one strength. First, it adds nothing new or different from the original book by Norman Vincent Peale "The Power of Positive Thinking"; second, during the reading I felt, many times, like I was hearing a preacher and not a man from bussines administration arena; third, in spite of the etimologic analisys of key words used to nominate the 10 traits, Ventrella has a very low conceptual precision. He makes some reference to some cognitive psychologists, like Ellis and Seligman, but the book is far from having a suond psychological foundation. The only strength I found in this book is the style to write: Ventrella has a light, entertaining way of writing. The stories and anecdotes he tells in his book make it easy and nice to read it. Books like this, that attempt to show the efficacy of an approach only based in some "succesfull" cases, without empirical support are not very usefull for changing nothing. From the time of the first edition of the Vincent Peale's book, a lot of literature has been published in the same line. If the subject (to be positive)was so simply and easy as this books say, we couldn't explain why depression continues growing up in the world. I think we need instead a better diffussion of more scientific solid demonstrated concepts and technics to relly help people 
 ... but if you loved the movie What the Bleep Do We Know, then you will be doubtless swept away by the warm and fuzzy feeling of this trite plot and rather cursory and one-dimensional examination of Western philosophy, which completely dismisses or ignores Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Husserl, Schopenhauer, Habermas, Foucault, Heidegger, and others (and totally misses the mark in its analysis of Sartre's humanism). 
 If you want my review in a nutshell, here it is: Two Defective Rise & Shine Lamps. One Call to Verilux. Verilux Refuses to Help.  If you wish to learn how this sorry state of affairs came to pass, read on.   My Verilux Product Experience:  I exchanged my first Verilux Rise and Shine Natural Alarm Clock & Bedside Lamp due to a non-functional internal speaker, ostensibly from loose wires that were shaken loose during shipping (if I am to understand the Verilux' company president's response to a similar defect report in these reviews). The good news: The speaker in the second unit now works. And contrary to some of the other reviewers I feel the Mylar speaker sounds quite good -- although dual stereo speakers would have been an even better choice (with a line-in jack for CD player or iPod). The bad: Despite the jumbo LCD display that might lead you to assume that the AM/FM tuner is digital, the radio is completely analog. The station IDs are printed in roughly 7-point type on the tuning dial instead -- small enough that some owners will need their glasses AND a magnifying glass to select a radio station. By contrast, I own an alarm clock by Conair with a similar analog tuner, with the exception that it uses roughly 8-point LCD digits to represent the radio frequency in the lower right-hand corner of the backlit LCD display. On Verilux' comparatively enormous LCD, I am left to wonder why the design team failed to consider that option. An analog tuner without a station display is something I expect from a $15 drugstore alarm clock, but not from a product of this type, which is otherwise very well thought out.  Unfortunately, due to an apparent flaw in the shade and/or the lamp itself, the shade on my replacement lamp -- the lamp I received from the store in exchange -- won't sit straight! One can remove the shade, look at the lamp on a level surface, and see the lamp "shelf" slope downward such that the shade itself also is similarly slanted! Making the situation worse, the lampshade is also slightly off insofar as the ring is not centered. There are three metal supports attached at the top of the shade that are bent downward and welded to a ring that sits about half way down (as typical of most lampshades). The ring, in turn, sits on the lamp body (or shelf). The whole assembly is cockeyed, including the socket into which the bulb sets (at a VERY obvious angle)!   Cosmetically speaking, there are also problems that are surprising to see in a product of this type. Whereas the first lamp I purchased has a very prominent nick in the plastic edge alongside the LCD panel, the replacement lamp has a scratch in the ivory plastic lamp body about an inch below the shade shelf, and it, too, must have been obtained in manufacturing.   As for the shade itself, it came out of the plastic wrap with a beige blemish, roughly 3/4", that looks like a pale stain against the bright white linen. So while the second lamp did not have a DOA speaker, I apparently traded one problem in for another. Worse, the lamp appears lopsided even from the opposite side of the room (and would probably appear that way from down the street if I were to set it on the curb). In short, the Verilux Rise & Shine lamp is just not up to the quality that the price/warranty suggests. And in case you are wondering if this might have been "gray market" merchandise, it wasn't. I purchased my Rise & Shine lamp straight out of a high-end, authorized retail store, new-in-box.   The AM/FM clock radio paired to the sunrise-simulating full-spectrum light, finished off by the eight high-quality digital nature sounds -- contained in a space-saving design roughly 6.5" wide at the base and 20" tall -- makes for an outstanding combination and concept. For this reason, I hope Verilux will continue to refine the Rise and Shine model, particularly where quality control is concerned.   Given that I am a gadget fan, and someone who has rated products 1/5th the price of this lamp very highly, it should be understood that I really wanted to give this a positive review. But two duds in a row?  IRONY  The Rise & Shine user manual emphatically instructs consumers to contact Verilux directly instead of returning defective products to the retailer. Given that my replacement lamp is also defective, I followed these instructions. But in reality, Verilux wants defective merchandise to become the retailers' problem, not theirs (as per the instruction I received to make a THIRD 40-mile trip back to the store where I purchased it). Conclusion?  VERILUX DOESN'T BACK THEIR WARRANTY (in my experience/opinion).  Nor, apparently, does Verilux care what kind of impression they leave on first-time customers. So if you think the impressive three-year warranty will help you if something should go wrong, consider what happened less than 72 hours into my ownership experience. And believe me, there was no rudeness involved to provoke this kind of reaction on the part of Verilux' customer service department, either.  What Verilux has apparently forgotten is that this is the age of the Internet. As it so happens, I supplement my income writing product reviews for Websites. In fact, I am a writer by training/trade. Translation: Verilux chose the wrong customer to let down. I have no intention of smearing Verilux' reputation -- unless telling the truth and nothing but the truth about my experience qualifies as such.  Would I recommend this product to a friend? Yesterday I might have said yes, chalking up the non-operative speaker in the first lamp to a fluke. Today, coupled with the fact that Verilux seemingly does not wish to stand behind their products even when it would take a mere lampshade to keep a customer happy, my answer is a resounding NO.  Should anyone at Verilux read my review, I wish to close with this thought: I could have learned to live with the cosmetic problems I noted, but a ~$5 lampshade, to replace the one that was blemished right out of the box -- and doesn't sit straight, to boot -- is that not worth keeping a first-time customer happy?  
 I purchased this used a few years back because I was always interested in the band though I had never heard them, I had heard ABOUT them , but never heard their music. It was a complete letdown. It sounds mostly like Kiss reject songs. It does have a nice 1970s production valkue to it, but the songs do not, I repeat, do not deliver. If this was the band's best of then I have to say the band was a complete waste of time. "White Lightening" is the only thing that resembles a good rock song, it has a good solid riff and chugs along quiet nicely, but the best song on the whole two discs is the re-working of "Walk Away Renee". If you liked this band when you were 10, then you are forgiven for having a soft spot for the group, for everyone else, however, skip this tripe. 
 This book really takes a deeper look at how challenges and adveristies affect you. It definatly makes a connection with the reader and it is very helpfull. The author speaks to you as though you are having a conversation and offers some wonderfull advice. I would highly reccomend this book 
 I don't think this title can qualify as a guidebook. It feels like it was written in a big hurry. Using it we found big holes. The advice in it is dated and there were so many discrepancies we had to buy another guide mid-vacation. Then our vacation took a big turnaround for the better.       Maui is a real beautiful place for a family vacation if you know where to go. The traffic was pretty bad but there are certain tricks for getting around all that 
 This book and its author's audacious writing style are so intriguing it draws one in despite three warning signs: 1) it's billed as 'post-modernist' which too often means a poor work which is defended on the basis of its detractors being too dull and simple to understand it in all its glory 2) it's historical fiction, which too often means the author is neither creative enough to make up his own story nor skilled enough to make accuracy rewarding and 3) it was recognized by the national book award which too often lately means the public is right for once, the reason only 200 people have read this book is that it's not good.  These telltales notwithstanding the book has the power to fascinate, and readers who hate to give up, or love a challenge, or whose curiosity is powerful will likely press on to see where this careening narrative is headed and be unable to stop - for a while.  Vollmann writes long, confusing, and through varied narrators but in the end this is not Dostoyevsky, Pynchon, or Faulkner.  Vollmann DOES have ability.  It's been pointed out by (just about all) reviewers that the book desperately needed aggressive editing, but reading it makes one think this author's ego would never permit that, so there's probably little hope of him realizing his true potential as a writer.  He certainly didn't with this one. Behind the awards and condescension of its champions this is just a mediocre book that's so so sooooooo long even a sucker for clumsily sprinkled erotica such as myself simply can't stand it 
 This book depressed me. I don't understand what other people see in it. I was thrilled when I finished it. I don't think Anne Tyler is my taste. 
 This would get it.  Yuck.  Blech.  Retch.  Barf.  Hurl.  etc. etc. etc.  This was supposed to be a tender tale of romantic discovery.  Instead it became one of those tiresome recountings of endless sexual encounters and moaning and groaning (each encounter employing slightly different adjectives and euphemisms, of course ... a rosebud is a rosebud is a rosebud.  lol)  It's worse than Barbara Cartland on a bender.  
 The only helpful thing in this book was the description of the five types.  This does provide a framework for analyzing different position.  The types could have been defined in a much shorter work.    The book does not offer clear Biblical argumentaion for or against differnt views.  One flaw (which is apparently common in Liberal theology) is that he talks about the New testament writers postions as if they were contrary and not complementary to each other.  For example he talks about Pauline and Johanine Theology as if they had separate, and contradictory on some points, views.   With each view Neibhur talks about a few historical people who have held this view.  These people are for the most part extremist who have taken one idea and thrown out the rest of the Bible. The majority of them were heretics.  The association of each view with some very extreme exponents of it may give the conservative Christian the impression that the view itself is heretical (Which it may or may not be).    More work needs to be done on this subject with Biblical argumentation for the different views.    If in reading this book you are (as I was) attempting to develop a Biblical theology of Christ and Culture I believe you will find it a dissapointment.    
 While interesting enough to keep me reading, overall the book wasn't what I might have expected.  Loaned to me, I had not read any of her previous work.  The characters were too artificial, until I decided that perhaps the whole thing was a parody of the gothic novels it revolved around.  But in the end, I decided it was just poorly written - especially with major questions unanswered such as the noise in the clearing, and its function as the major deus ex machina of the boo 
 Phyllis Chesler shares what she perceives as an alarming new trend among leftwing groups. However, the groups that merit alarm for becoming newly, or in reality more visibly anti-Semitic, have always relied on antagonism and violence for motivation. Workers should hate their bosses, women should hate men, blacks should hate whites, etc. We're not talking about hatred in the abstract, but deep-bred hatred that calls for action, strife and turmoil. Someone please correct me, but it sounds as though the author was all for the "movement" as long as the hatreds were directed the way she prefers. Now that the beast has unleashed a little fury towards her group, she doesn't appear to have second thoughts about the worthiness of her causes, but rather she sounds as though she wishes that she could direct the hate back to where she would prefer it to go. Also, I found the writing extremely flawed in many places. And, there don't appear to be references to back-up all the allegations of "terrorism", i.e. many acts appear to be random criminal violence that just happened to involve Jews. My sympathies to those people, but all of us are faced with such incidents 
 		This is a book by a chronic kicker, someone who frequently cites Emile Zola but who has all the relevance of "a young contrarian" wallowing in what is otherwise known as the terrible twos.  	Don't get me wrong:  Hitchens is very self-important, his targets range from President Clinton to Mother Teresa, which earned him an interview with Vatican authorities in a "closed room, a Bible, a tape-recorder, a Monsignor, a Deacon and a Father."  He spent years attacking Clinton, and was finally thrilled when someone noted his piffle.  But, this molehill of courage doesn't write a word in this book about President Geoge Bush.  	He says it's courageous and vital to dissent.  Nice.  Welcome to an idea that has been celebrated since John Milton and the First Amendmant to the US Constitution.  To guard his own brilliance, he doesn't cite a single example of the how, when, where, why and what of anyone he's criticized.  His book is supposed to be "the art of mentoring," but he limits it to praise of his own courage, insight, wit and relevance.  	Granted, Hitchens is a rare talent;  his unique ability is being outrageous without being effective.  He doesn't cite a single example of his dissonance doing diddly squat.  He offers feel-good whines, moans and complaints, but nothing constructive.  It's why late-night TV talk show monologues are the epitome of today's political commentary, humour, satire and relevance.  	He consistently attacks political compromise, praising "fanatics and absolutists like John Brown, who regarded compromise as a disgrace."  So  --  was Abraham Lincoln a second-rate president compared to a John Brown?  This reflects the great weakness of this book:  Hitchens doesn't understand the difference between dissent and dissonance.  	There's a good reason why Hitchens is inconsequential compared to dissent such as Zola, Vaclav Havel and even Tom Lehrer  --  this rant is always safe, tame and respectable.  It's a perfect Hallowe'en gift, a fierce rubbery face meant to produce a shriek, a laugh and a comment, "Oh, how clever!"  It's great sport for the two-year-old mentality.  	"Most people, most of the time, prefer to seek approval or security," Hitchens writes.  This is his meagre attempt at respectability;  he does so by citing great dissenters and basking in their reflected courage, glory and relevance.  He falls far short of being a court jester, lacking the wit, wisdom, wiles and wariness to be relevant.  Sadly, but not unexpectedly, he misses the mark 
 I bought this book for my 21 month old as she loves so many of the Dr. Suess books.  We didn't even get through the first couple of pages before she was bored with the story and illustrations.  Maybe she'll like it better in a few years, but for now it is just sitting on the shelf.. 
 Like Williams' Theodosian work, this book is an easy read that more or less sums up what previous scholarship without new analysis.  It's a good introduction to the period but not on par with biographies of other emperors such as Constantine and Julian 
 Not worth the money as a technical reference or how-to book. Otherwise a pleasant read with some inpired pics and a very general overview of the process. Speaks, for the most part, to strawbale contruction as if strawbales are some naturally occurring thing harvested from the wild when are in fact a product of energy intensive industrial agriculture.  Fails to provide important technical details such as estimating for coverage, application on masonry, frame and other 'natural' structures, guidelines for plaster preparation. If you already have building experience and skills there are far better reference books available to actually base work upon.     
 I think the author is so enamored with her hipness, that she has convinced a wimpy editor to not edit out all the crap, crap, crap.  Horrid, boring, blathering writing.  She goes on, and on, and on.  She could say what she means in half the words.  Waste of time to read this.  (Must she continue with the "yo mama" and the "goddess" this and that-- and Grrrr can't stand her 
 I used to love SB novels, but the last few have been so very disappointing and "Into the Storm" is, by far, the worst.  There is no character development so we don't understand why couples who are formed in the book would be attracted to each other.  Basically, they've known each other, at best, casually through work - they sleep together - having the most amazing sex ever! and they suddenly decide they care deeply about each other.  Hmmm, that may work at 17, but the characters are in their late 20s and early 30s.  They have very responsible, professional careers and by now, should know that love is based on far more than casual sex.    The situations SB keeps coming up with are becoming more and more amateurish and bizarre.  All of these factors caused me to quickly lose interest in the book and I began skimming pages hoping that something, somewhere would grab my attention.  No such luck.  I used to love reading SB novels.  I couldn't wait for new books to be published and I'd stay up late into the night reading.  No more.  In fact, I think I'm done with Brockmann.  Granted, I never read SB for the suspense.  I loved the character development, the character interaction and the adventure that made sense to the story.  If I want suspense, which appears to be where SB would rather go these days, I'd much rather spend my time and money reading Tess Gerritsen or Karin Slaughter.  They do suspense so much better 
 Being familiar with HTML programming and Front Page 2003 (and of course Word 2003), this book is boring. Though the author explains something, the author goes back again and again in the same topic. In one lesson I was so confused that I finally fixed the problem by HTML coding. Another major problem is author's unclear definition of a file as part of a directory. For example: In Lesson_04, she states the following to open index.html file: Open index.html from Lesson_04_CSS folder. This is not true. It should clearly state: Open Lesson_04_CSS\Completed\index.html. There are others index.html files in Lesson_04. Good thing of book the CD files to check. Josep 
 Fans of the ABC-TV show "LOST" will probably be buying "Our Mutual Friend" in droves after having seen Desmond keeping it to be the "last book [I] ever [read]".  Since I did not have to buy it, having purchased a full set of Dickens years ago, I immediately set out to read it.  What a disappointment it was!  Dickens wrote it on an installment basis publishing it in a magazine over a 19 month period.  One cannot avoid a sneaking suspicion while reading it that it is, just a bit, perhaps, 'padded'.  Any good editor could have tightened it up at least 200 pages.   Dickens' work is melodrama, but some of it is just more overwrought than is compatible with good art.  As Oscar Wilde said of 'The Old Curiosity Shop', "I simply cannot read of the death of Little Nell without laughing."  'OMF' goes quickly down to this level of bathos and remains there to the last sentence.   Even worse is the ending.  Some endings just can't help but feel contrived; and Dickens, having gotten a large number of his characters into drastic positions, pulls so many strange- colored rabbits out of his hat that the reader simply feels cheated.  All of this may seem rather harsh from someone who was willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for "The Complete Oxford Illustrated Dickens" but I assure you that my only concern is for you, gentle reader.  Unless you are possessed of adequate time to read the whole of Dickens' oeuvre or are required to read "Our Mutual Friend", I would, instead, direct you to Dickens' far superior works:  'David Copperfield', 'Oliver Twist', 'Pickwick Papers'.    If you are looking for 'LOST' reading material, I would refer you to 'Watership Down' (Excellent), 'The Stand' (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature), 'The Dark Tower' series (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature, and similar to 'Our Mutual Friend' possessed of a fatally flawed ending) or a review of philosophy like 'Locke, Rousseau and Hume'.

 First off let me say that I am a huge fan of Cameron Crowe (read my review of vanilla sky if you don't believe me). Now let me tell you why this movie didn't work for me. 1.  The plot is almost a direct rip off of his previous movie, Jerry Maguire:  Guy has nice job, loses nice job, gets depressed, finds girl to change said depression. 2.  The acting is barely worth noticing.  Orlando Bloom does not make for a good narrative voice.  Kirsten Dunst was trying so hard to be quirky that she loses all appeal. 3.  The emotion was not there.  We are supposed to feel sorry for Orlando Blooms character (I actually can't remember his charcters name) but he conveys nothing that allows me to feel sorry for him.    AND THIS IS IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM  4.  The music.  He has never failed to deliver a great soundtrack in the past with each and every movie he released, but the problem with this one is that he tried to build a movie around the soundtrack instead of vice versa.  He misuses the songs that he chooses and he overuses songs altogether.  What he attempted to do was to evoke an emotion by inserting a song into a scene.  This doesn't work if the scene doesn't work.  What made his other movies so great was he allowed the music to reinforce the emotion of a scene, but what he has done here is tried to make the music the only emotion there, which doesn't have as much of an impact.   Three Tom Petty songs is too many for one movie (and I love Tom Petty).  Two Ryan Adams song is also too many for one movie.  If you oversaturate a movie with music, then it starts to lose all its luster.  Cameron Crowe didn't trust his actors to deliver the emotion so he relied on the music. 4(a).  The music he didn't use.  During the road trip part of the movie the viewer gets to see part of the song list that he is listening to.  The list included songs by:  Red House Painters, Sun Kil Moon and Nick Cave just to name a few, but we never hear these songs anywhere in the movie.  Hey Cameron, couldn't you have replaced just on Tom Petty song with a Sun Kil Moon song?  Salvador Sanchez is a great song and it was on the playlist, so why didn't you use it?  Did you not trust the listeners to appreciate that type of song?  I guess what I'm saying is, this movie didn't work for me 
 It is authors and books like these that continue to show that there is no evolution in the novels put out but white wolf...they only want action, no character development or originality, is really very sad. You want a good fanatsy book...read someone like Sharon Shinn, Glen Cook or Mercedes Lackey and steer clear of  poorly written amateur books such as this one 
 i just finished reading the book.  there is nothing in it about velocity... It's boring, predictable and has lots of "filler text 
 Mr. Wills is notably well read and educated. Unfortunately, for someone like myself who is brought up in a highly "superstitious" Catholic upbringing.  This book proved to be too scholastic for me. Mr. Wills brought out terms and references within the faith which I need to constantly look up from the web.   I've read Cathecism of the Catholic church and the History of Christianity but those books were just side notes compared to what Mr. Wills is trying to say.   It's just not a good read, as I find it extremely hard to understand. I would have hoped that there's a disclaimer somewhere saying, please read a Beginners Guide to Catholism, or History of Catholism first before attempting to read this book 
 I have just a very few words to say about this not too inventive construct " Its undeniably the most implausible book i've ever read on any subject "  
 The rubber does not go around the screen, and is generally poorly designed. The bit of sticky backed plastic thet supply to go onto the screen leaves bubbles of air on the screen. I shall now be ordering the official Apple one in the hope that that is a lot better than this thing. Hope that helps 
 I just finished McCarthy's book, The Road, last night and frankly I have to totally agree with a. reader's (Upstate New York) comments.  Indeed, it must be nice to be a recognized, award winning author and get away with anything you write.  When I read the reviews and the flap of the book I was interested enough to buy and read it.  I'll be off to Half Price Books as soon as possible to at least recover some of the money I lost in buying this book.  I was led to believe the story would provide this "awesome" connection between a father and his son.  The conversations between these two are absurd with one and two word sentences.  One "Five Star" reviewer called this a "poignant story of love between father and son."  PLEASE, give me a break, most siblings have more than two word sentences between themselves and their father.  There is no doubt these two are traveling through horrendous times, but McCarthy's description of the terrain is pathetic and redundant.  By the way, how did these guys survive up to the point of when the book begins, supposedly seven or eight years later?  What happen to the people who owned the storm cellar?  Leaving the storm cellar with all of its provisions was preposterous.  How did the father obtain additional bullets after only having one following the shooting?  The bullets he found were the wrong caliber.  Too many gaps and inconsistencies.    When I finally reached the end of the story, I was completely disappointed.  The son had to be the luckiest person on the planet.  It seemed as if McCarthy had reached a deadline with Knopf Publisher and he had to wrap-up the manuscript instead of ending with some sort of a conclusion.  This was the most unrealistic story of a post "unknown disaster" I believe I have ever read.  This book is a TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY unless you happen to be someone who reads McCarthy's writings regardless of what he writes.  Maybe the "Five Star" reviewers are running interference for McCarthy's weak excuse for a story.  If I were the CEO of Knopf Publisher, I would be asking a lot of questions about the publishing of this book.   Bottomline, if you are a devoted fan of McCarthy's buy the book and fall in line with all the "Five Star" reviewers; otherwise, don't waste your time or money.  PS:  When did we start spelling couldn't as couldnt 
 Oh my, all the terrible reviews for this book are true!!  Ms. Steel is excessively repetitive....I mean EXCESSIVE.  Ms. Steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book...and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over...you get the picture.  I too found myself saying, "Okay, we get it already..."  I also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had.  I don't know the men Ms. Steel knows and hangs out with, but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other, as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them.  Oh please, no man on earth talks that way.  Especially to other men.  This book is completely aweful.  The plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention.  I have read many of Ms. Steel's books and I believe this one is her worst.  I have now started reading Sandra Brown and she is sooo much better.  I recommend "The Alibi."  So far that has been my favorite by her.  She has mystery, suspense, romance...  Her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than Ms. Steels.  To sum it up, I was completely disappointed with the book "Toxic Bachelors."  I highly recommend Sandra Brown, she is a much better author 
 i loved this one as a kid but now it shows it's age and it really gets the history wrong. part of the problem is that other than robert shaw's part the rest of the movies follows far to many people into far to many subplots and gets lost. the locations used don't show us the real winter conditions that were faced and even at the running time it has it moves far to slow and then just ends quickly. see battleground for a better take on this battle 
 Editorial Reviews  Amazon.com essential video After initially rejecting the role as too sentimental, Ginger Rogers found the title character of Kitty Foyle to be an Oscar winner and a career breakthrough. Released in 1940, only a year after her nine-picture partnership with Fred Astaire ended, Kitty Foyle helped establish Rogers as a nonmusical box-office star. The film portrays a white-collar working girl who receives a warm and welcome marriage proposal from Mark (James Craig), a kindly but humble doctor. As soon as she accepts, however, she receives a different proposition, this one from her former love, wealthy socialite Wyn (Dennis Morgan), who plans to flee his life and his wife and asks Kitty to join him and live in unwedded bliss in South America. Kitty then recounts her life in flashback to help her choose which man to love. Rogers gives an appealing performance as the feisty yet vulnerable Kitty, who makes up in moxie what she lacks in social status. Did she really deserve the Best Actress Oscar over Bette Davis in The Letter, Joan Fontaine in Rebecca, Katharine Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story, and Martha Scott in Our Town? Well, evidently Rogers had real-life moxie too. --David Horiuchi   Product Description Known for light comedies and her partnership with Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers stepped off the dance floor and into 1940's Oscar spotlight with her Best Actress turn as Kitty, an indomitable working-class girl who endures the rejection of Philadelphia society, makes her own way as a single woman and ultimately chooses between an unmarried arrangement with Main Line scion Wynnewood Strafford VI (Dennis Morgan) or marriage to a struggling physician (James Craig). Rogers' deserved Academy Award confirmed she was more than a dance star - a fact humorously underscored when she returned to the studio and was greeted by staffers and actors in top hats and tails. Jane Wyman won the Best Actress Academy Award for her sensitive portrayal of Belinda, capturing the girl's affecting isolation, awakening desire to learn and ultimate triumph. Directed by Jean Negulesco and co-starring Lew Ayres, Charles Bickford and Agnes Moorehead (all four Oscar nominees* for their fine work), Johnny Belinda (nominated for a total 11 Oscars including Best Picture) blends atmosphere, nuance and high drama into a heartbreaking classi 
 I read this trilogy because I loved James Scott Bell's "Breach of Promise." I finished all three books mainly because I wanted something clean to read, but I was very disappointed. The legal angles are intriguing, but as the books went on it became harder and harder to take Kit Shannon seriously. Can Peterson really expect us to believe that a person could come out of nowhere to singlehandedly transform the LA legal scene, take on William Randolph Hearst, have tea with the President, and debate the Bible with Clarence Darrow?! That's just too much for me to buy, and I'm sorry to say I cannot recommend this series. People who want to read legal dramas that are both clean AND artistic will need to look elsewhere 
 I started Hegel's 814 page Phenomenology of Mind 18 months ago.  I finished it a week ago.  I turn to the back pages where my notes would be to find I made none.  If anyone other than me ever tells you he read this opaque monstrosity, this Finnigans' Wake of philosophy, he is almost certainly lying.  I dog-eared the bottom of a few pages, which is my way of signaling that there is something there which may be interesting but not succinctly quotable.  Rereading those pages in preparation for the fulfillment of my promise, I still find little to distill.    From page pages 399-401: "If we put both sides of the universal ordinance over against one another and consider them, we see that this later universality has for its content restless individuality, which regards opinion or mere individualism as law, the real as unreal, and the unreal as real.  That universality is, however, at the same time the side of realization of the ordinance, for to it belongs the independent self-existence (Fursichseyn) of individuality.  The other side is the universal in the sense of stable passive essence; but, for that very reason, the absolutely non-existent, but still not an actual reality, and can itself only become actual by canceling the individuality, that has presumed to claim actuality.  This type of consciousness, which becomes aware of  itself in the law; which finds itself in what is inherently true and good not as mere individual, but only as essentially real; and which knows individuality to be what is perverted and perverting, and hence feels bound to surrender and sacrifice individualism of consciousness - this type of consciousness is Virtue."   ...   "The mood of moral sentimentalism is reduced to confusion and contradiction: but the subjective individualism in which it is rooted is not yet eradicated.  Individualism now takes refuge in another attitude which claims to do greater justice to the inherent universality of rational self-realization....  The World's course is this to owe its goodness to the efforts of the individual.  A struggle ensues, for the situation is contradictory; and the issue of the struggle goes to prove that the individual is not the fons et origo boni, that goodness does not await his efforts, and that in fact the course of the world is at heart good; the soul of the world is righteous.   "The attitude analyzed here is that of abstract moral idealism, the mood of moral strenuousness, the mood that constantly seeks the improvement and perfectibility of mankind.  It is found in many forms, but particularly wherever there is any strong enmity between the "ideal" life and the "life of the world".   A mere 179 pages later I found this gem:   "As everything is useful for man, man is likewise useful too, and his characteristic function consists in making himself a member of the human herd, of use for the common good, and serviceable to all.  The extent to which he looks after his own interests is the measure with which he must also serve the purpose of others, and so far as he serves their turn, he is taking care of himself: the one hand washes the other.  But wherever he finds himself there he is in his right place; he makes use of others and is himself made use of.   "Different things are serviceable to one another in different ways.  All things, however, have this reciprocity of utility by their very nature, by being related to the Absolute in the two fold manner, the one positive, whereby they have a being all their own, the other negative, and thereby exist for others.  The relation to Absolute Being, or Religion, is therefore of all forms of profitableness the most supremely profitable. . .   "Belief, of course, finds this positive outcome of enlightenment as much an abomination as its negative attitude towards belief.  This enlightened insight into absolute Being, that sees nothing in it but just absolute Being, the etre supremen, the great Void - this intention to find that everything in its immediate existence is inherently real (ansich) or good, and finally to find the relation of the individual conscious entity to the Absolute Being, Religion, exhaustively summed up in the conception of profitableness - all this is for belief utterly and simply revolting.  This special and peculiar wisdom of enlightenment necessarily seems at the same time to the believing mind to be sheer insipidity and the confession of insipidity; because it consists in knowing nothing of absolute Being, or, what amounts to the same thing, in knowing this entirely accurate platitude regarding it - that it is merely absolute Being, and, again, in knowing nothing but finitude, taking this, moreover, to be the truth, and thinking this knowledge about finitude as the truth to be the highest knowledge attainable."   the juice not worth the squeez 
 This novel tries to be funny, but the satire falls flat and the whole thing quickly becomes totally tedious. I bailed after 75 pages 
 I found this novel aesthetically pleasing, well written and interestingly structured, as well as witty in places, but hardly hilarious as others here have suggested. Regarding the book seeming to be written by a female (with all the presumptions of enlightenment that that carries with it - in this text and in literati generally) due its satirical reworkings of phallocentric myths and legends, I would say that the first 'novel' in history by Cervantes did just that, so phallused author's have a decent tradition in that area; having said that, this comment made the course material of my literature course at university, so you can see how pervasive it is. I don't blame the book for its strident and parochial feminist/misandrist and postcolonial themes - there is almost a complete cultural saturation of it. The book works in very well with current literary theory and should be used by all like-minded people as a text to place new 'Portias' and 'Shylocks' in different racial/cultural groups - same sort of hatreds with different wrappings. It's a shame, because King's talents as a writer are very great, despite the ideolatry. 
 I ordered this DVD player so I wouldn't wear down my Xbox by playing movies on it all the time.  I didn't have any of the audio problems that others have reported, however, after about 4-6 weeks of use it just died.  I couldn't even get it to power on.  If you're looking for a cheap DVD player this will do, just remember, You get what you pay for 
 Unfortunately, this book is only going to help you if you're a fat nagging religious close minded wife who's let herself go.   For the modern woman with common sense (and who doesn't have her man beg her for sex, for instance) this book is completely useless. I can think of a few women who'd benefit from it (church ladies?), but most of the things on this book are common sense to a well educated wordly woman. I also found Shaunti Feldhahn's way of writing very anoying...at the beggining of the book, it feels like she goes on and on about respect forever. I get it, respect the man, there's no need to say it 30 times with different words.  It was definitly a waste of money.   
 If you're looking for a serious approach to the topics of religious belief or life after death, this isn't it.  It's a poor attempt by an author who  is terrific at conjecture, but poorly trained in the field of religious  phenomenology 
 This one got way too much attention from NPR. I loved the interview there with the author, but, quite frankly, his entire story was told in that very sitting. This "book" is really an "essay" that doesn't deserve all the paper it's printed on; I would've been much more appreciative of this author's sentiments had it been marketed more appropriately 
 This book to find Mr./Ms. Right is written by a man divorced three times...  If the author is having that much trouble, maybe he isn't the best source for this topic 
 I agree with David Thomson when he says few audiences in the West would be content to view an American epic composed solely of battles and their contexts. Kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the West was entrenched with "Kagemusha" and "Ran", he knew what (American) audiences think of as heroic and mystical about "historical" Japan: Kurosawa's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what Americans (or Westerners) imagine about Japan. He was not popular in Japan (where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded, hence the suicide attempt). I am not saying that the work is rubbish - there is no "ugly" shot in either "Ran" or "Kag" - merely that there are more "authentically Japanese" films out there to choose from.   
 Terrible and pretentious writing. I tried to read this book without much luck. If you have trouble sleeping, this is the perfect sleeping pill. 
 Isn't Barbie supposed to be pretty? She looks like an ugly prostitute, hands down. I wouldn't "wear that to a club" and neither would ANY of my friends. Her make up is gross, and especially the look on her face says, "Do me now." There's a difference between beauty and over-the-top trashy. You can't deny that she looks like a porn-star, which is an industry that is illegal for teenagers who get this doll to participate in, but I guess we're preparing our youth for this at a younger age now 
 Think pop music is already bad? Bored of the Buble/Timberlake/latest rapper with purposefully misspelled name? Then this CD confirms the worst is yet to come.Most pop music is awful...but when it's sung by a children's choir,it's worse.  Kelly Clarkson's "Walk away" becomes a playground taunt,and the Fray's "Over my head",an emo indie rock song,becomes sappy.KT Tunstall's famously annoying "Black Horse&Cherry Tree" gets an even worse cover by the Kidz Bop kids.John Mayer's anthem about changing the world&bringing friends home from war gets slowed down&sugared up.Of course,the Kidz Bop kids also sing about adult issues-such as asking a troublesome boyfriend to stay the night ("Too little,too late"),carrying on a romance in the public eye ("A Public Affair"),and cheating on one's girlfriend with one's ex ("Lips of an Angel")  Yeah..talk about kid friendly...yeah right 
 so they could be bored to death by this poseur 
 This is the first Grafton book I've read, but I'm pretty sure it will be my last.  Simply put, this is the worst book I've read in the past year.  The plot is ridiculous: it centers around the murder of woman who is prostitute/porn star/water treatment plant worker.  The characters only exist as canned responses to the investigator's questions.  Critical clue are revealed in predictable fashion to achieve an utterly anti-climactic ending devoid of any epiphanies or suspense.  
 in this set, which I gave to my daughter for Christmas, when she unwrapped it, the box was broken on two edges.  We are reading book #3 and the pages have begun falling out.  The quality of the set is the problem.  The stories are wonderful 
 I would not recommend this book to anyone who truly believes the Bible.It is full of errors. It embraces evolution time lines, doubts the accuracy of the bible, and truly mixes up where the true church comes from. Please check it out for yourself before you buy 
 If  you enjoy Debbie Macomber, Mary Kruger and Maggie Sefton - skip this one.  There is nothing in the least little bit funny about getting drunk on a regular basis.  The language leaves a great deal to be desired.  As an avid knitter and having many friends who knit, none of us would relate in the least to this book.  The knitting aspect of it is an aside and drew me in with the title.  An extremely disappointing book with shallow characters with almost no redeeming qualities.  Sari is by far the more interesting character and the information on children who are autistic is good but the rest of the book is a waste of time - in the language of knitting - skip this one 
 Spiegelman's first book "Black Maps," was one I very much enjoyed.  I wish I could say the same for this.  It wasn't bad, but it seemed to plod along, without much happening, never being terribly involving or suspenseful.  For me, part of the problem was that I never really cared about any of the characters except Jane, Marsh's girlfriend, who was the most interesting one of the group and received a bad deal in her relationship with Marsh.  Maybe I'm tired of perpetually angst-driven, commitment-phobic protagonists.  So while it wasn't terrible, it was definitely a disappointment.  Read "Black Maps" and, if you do read this, wait for it in paperback 
 Before you read the book, look at the sources.  I only found one scientific paper out of hundreds of sources. Everything else has to be classified as opinions.  Sources for this book  include news stories and testimonies in congress.  I will point out by two examples (not from the book, but from information that you are probably familiar with) why these are not good sources. I recall the news stories based on the opinions of experts that said it would take five years to put out the oil well fires started in the first Gulf War.  They were all wrong.  It took six months.  CEO's and others testified before congress about tobacco products being non-addictive.  Were they correct? No! So when we read this book, we can't be sure of anything.  It is a book of opinions and ideas.  Some of them may be good, but they may also be bad.  This is why we have science and the scientific method.  Even science may be corrupted at times or fail until we have a better understanding. Even if Mr. Gore had scientific papers, it is unlikely that he could judge whether they really support his environmental views.  He would need a Ph.D. or at least a lot of experience in the proper field(s) to interpret scientific papers properly.  This book discusses how corporations are unfriendly to the environment. Surely some of them are.  But so is the government.  When the government plant at Fernald, Ohio, (near Cincinnati) was accused of poluting the soil and water with radioactive waste, the government denied, dragged its feet, and fought in court. The government lost it case because there was obvious guilt, but the government did not hestitate to fight against the very people it represents. When you or I appear to be at fault in an auto accident, do we admit it and offer to pay all claims, or do we take a less candid approach as our insurance company suggests?  We might even think we are not at fault. Mr. Gore has denied being at fault countless times in his political career, but he can't believe that a corporation should do anything but admit guilt, accept every environmental claim that is made, and pay large sums of money.  Mr. Gore is an elitist.  First, he believes that he is an environmental expert because he has heard a lot of opinions. He doesn't need an advanced degree in environmental science  or experience in that field.  He just knows better because he is Al Gore. Secondly, he sees how he uses the environment and how you should use the environment quite differently.  When he was Vice President, he flew to Kyoto, Japan, to symbolically (read unnecessary trip) approve the Kyoto Treaty.  He used more than 180,000 gallons of fuel in a private government plane in one day.  My wife and I can drive our cars and heat our house for our lifetimes and never use this amount of fuel.  During his Presidental campaign, Mr. Gore would fly a private jet to his son's games.  I have no great objection to the former Vice President doing these things as long as he doesn't start telling me how I am abusing the environment, that I should drive an electric car, ...  I do have trouble believing his environmental views are anything but political.  If you like the views in the book, read it and feel good.  If you don't like the views, read it for some good laughs.  There are plenty of flaws.  Books like this make money, but they don't make good science, and they don't produce good policy.  Don't forget to recycle the book 
 The writer needs to go back to being just a housewife! This book is SO BORING! Must have been copied from other books or website, not much detail, just enough to start getting interested, then it leaves you hanging. If you are having trouble falling asleep, don't take a sleeping pill, just start reading this book! It will make you so drowsey you will have problems staying awake 
   To be sure, there are some intriguing speculations in this book, such as the one concerning the distinction between the historic Jesus of Nazareth and the Christ, and the  --- not all that novel  --- analysis of the Jewish Tanakh and of the two Christian Testaments purely as literary texts. These speculations, if properly stretched, could fill a quaint fifty minute lecture. But to keep holding forth for the full two-hundred-some pages it takes to fill a book, of necessity takes Harold Bloom out of his depth, to where the same quite trivial points are being repeated over and over. Obsessive repetition would not be out of place in a religious text, but in a literary analysis it signals careless editing and/or a dearth of ideas.  Bloom informs the reader that he worships neither at Yahweh's nor at the Christian God's altar. Instead, we catch him worshipping at William Shakespeare's admittedly superb altar; indeed he acts as if he were the bard's latter day grand ayatollah. He keeps telling the reader and then forever reminding him, that in this capacity he has the biblical characters paired with Shakespearean characters, Jesus with the Danish prince Hamlet and Yahweh with the erratic King Lear. Hamlet and Lear appearing in different plays, do not get to exchange any dialogue, and wouldn't you know, nor do their biblical counterparts, just arias, no duets.   By the author's reckoning, the historic Jesus was the greatest "Jewish genius" before Sigmund Freud of all people. This does not deter Bloom from issuing the additional fatwa that Freud's oedipal take on the Danish prince is all hogwash. For all anyone knows, this may even be so. I, for one, find the oedipal interpretation of Hamlet more amusing than convincing.  Bloom however doesn't even amuse, nor does he bother to present any convincing arguments in his refutation of Freud. But then, fatwas will be fatwas and, in all fairness, Bloom never claims to be a "Jewish genius." 
 Zulakika's Basque Violence is a confusing and chaotic work which attempts to examine the cultural background to the question of why a terroristic form of violence haunts the Basque people.  The works' shortcomings are abundant and ubiquitous throughout his writing.  No one outside of the field of ethnography will be able to comprehend the overpowering amount of  ethnographic jargon that inundates Zulakika's work.  His work is also delinquent in the fact that very few readers outside of the Basque culture could understand or find the thesis of the work. The reader feels as if he or she is stuck the eccentric mind of a bedlamite, who is rattling off the hagiology of the Basque culture from the Paleolithic era to modern day. The book is structured in what would appear at first glance to be studies of different areas of Basque culture and its relation to the violence that has been occurring in the area; however, the book fails to accomplish this task as well.  Readers will be greatly disappointed with this work because it does not realize any of the intended goals that the author set for himself work 
 Wow, I was expecting a fun, light read, and in the first chapter already had to skim over a couple of paragraphs relating to "mishaps" that happen to animals in Zippy's life. Well, I thought, next chapter will be better. NOT. The next chapter included a graphic scene of chickens being slaughtered by shovels! Every chapter so far has had something very disturbing about animals in it! If you are sensitive to these things, I would not recommend the book. I'm not sure I'm going to finish it at this rate. Granted, I AM super-sensitive to any animal suffering, but this is really overload. I'm halfway through and so far this is the list: The aforementioned chicken slaughter, a neighbor stealing her cat and starving it in the basement, another neighbor looking to poison her cat, dog-sitting for friends and losing the dog and not worrying about it that much and finding him dead days later, her father going out with a shotgun to kill the dogs who massacred Zippy's pet chicken, joking about a neighbor enjoying "puppy stew", keeping her two dogs penned up, torturing a raccoon by holding in front of 30 braying hounds.... I mean, does that seem like a lot to you??? For a light-hearted "tender" memoir???? Jeez louise! I can't sleep at night from this book 
 This is the third book by Mr. Evening that I have purchased and again I am disappointed by how the author can make a seemingly easy to use product so difficult to understand. I respect his knowledge, but would rather be able to start right in using a program with USEFUL tips rather than a detailed analysis on EVERY aspect. I will  stick with Scott Kelby's sometimes irritating humor because of his simple, yet effective means of explaining a subject 
 After you have read a few of Coulter's romanic fiction novels, they become the very same story over and over again.  However, her contemporary mystery plots remain very good 
 I ordered this movie on or around July 6, 2006 and have yet to receive it 
 back and forth and back and forth.  im happy.  im sad.  happy.  sad.  love him.  dont love him.  love him.  dont blah. blah blah.  we're poor.  we're not poor.  we're poor.   a series of a series of a series of deus ex machinas.  malamud's writing style is easy to slip into, and the story is addictive yet annoying (any pulp novel can be addictive).    spoiler    he rapes her and and spies on her undressing and it's ok!  (no, don't try to sell me any of that oh the author's not giving this his approval, no no no.  when there is nothing to contradict something, it's the same as saying it's ok.  the same as if someone writes a book where everyone is racist and there is nothing in the book to say that being racist is bad.  in this book there is nothing to say that raping someone is bad and that irks me.)     
 "I really take Nietzsche to town"--this is a quote from Marilynne Robinson. I heard her say this once at a writer's workshop in Saratoga Springs shortly before this collection, The Death of Adam, was printed. Who would SAY such a thing? It's not that one cannot argue with Nietzsche's thought--but "take him to town"? One may recall Rush Limbaugh, for instance, who, whenever he is under fire for getting someone angry, responds, "That's because I'M RIGHT."   Her book never gets much more intelligent than her quote.   The reviewer who said Robinson has an axe to grind here was right! These essays are well written but often full of a grudging and largely uninformed conservative viewpoint. Like many books that espouse such views, this one seems to see itself as some kind of enlightening  alternative to the "accepted" wisdom about contemporary science and morality. Bosh!     This book was written out of sheer discomfort. Robinson doesn't seem to have given writers such as Darwin and Nietzsche the kind of reading they deserve--that is, the type in which the reader does not immediately discount all ideas that seem like they will lead to undesirable consequences (Nietzsche and Darwin led to Hitler, that kind of tiresome cliche). Come now Marilynne, didn't we get enough of that kind of thing listening to the frat boys argue with the professor in Humanities Seminar back in freshman year? For one who sets out to undermine accepted wisdom, Robinson espouses it in ludicrous amounts.    If you don't happen to agree with Robinson already, most of her thinking will jump out as the usual smokescreen behind which essentially conservative thinkers carry out their specious assault on everything that makes them uncomfortable. 
 I enjoyed other, more recent, books by William Poundstone and I decided to try this. I was very disappointed. I am sure the fact that the book was written twenty years ago contributes to my disappointment: many subjects present only nostalgic value for some people and mostly outdated. Don't look for revelations - the author is mostly speculating on the subject (secrets mostly will stay secrets). In our time much more and better information could be found on the Internet. I gave it two stars just for some historical data that I found sometimes interesting 
 I was disappointed with the book. Like the others, the book lost what little integrity I was willing to give it to start when Catherine said she lived in 1863 BC. Given that the author repeatedly states that he is a traditionally-trained medical professional, his material is starkly lacking in any kind of verifiable fact or scientific questioning. The book reads like a personal diary of someone who is searching for meaning in his life rather than a case study. I think the thing that bothered me the most is that it is obvious he uses the patient for his own purposes in sessions that he allows to go on for hours on end to await messages from the Masters. Seems unethical to me (a lesson he must still need to learn.) I thought it especially odd that the first other professional he brings into to observe a session is his wife and not an objective colleague.  I read many of the reviews below and I like what one said about past lives recollection being born from the mental garbage of the Earth. That seems more likely. I encourage you to keep searching for the truth. Do not settle for the soul candy offered in this book 
 Huge fan of the Art of Noise first album  "Who's Afraid...?",  the "original" lineup and all that. Not at all happy with what came next(  the novelty covers and duets with Maxx Headroom,  Tom Jones, Duane Eddy, et al) after Morley and Horn left. I had very high hopes for this highly hyped "reunion" cd, but I'm just not feeling it. The idea is very lazy creatively , rather Malcolm McLaren-ish ( it reminds me of his "Fans" album from the mid-eighties )and the execution is not up to par with their work together on "Who's Afraid...?"  Had this album been approached in a more staightforward way, like the William Orbit collection Pieces in a Modern Style, or even like some of Wendy Carlos' work as an interpreter of classical music using synthetic devices, it might be more inspiring or engaging. But as it is, this is for me  a big letdown 
 Two readings straight through, back to back, and I still couldn't figure out what anyone sees in this overwrought piffle 
 All the poems are smooth and clever and slightly (or more than slightly) ironic.  They sometimes make me smile, but they seldom make me feel much.    I was recently at a poetry reading Collins gave, where he was greatly applauded.  He mentioned that sentimentality is a cardinal sin in poetry.  That's true.  But I couldn't emotionally connect to the self-consciously witty voices speaking out of his poems, and by the end of this collection I didn't really want to.  When I first read Collins, I was hoping to find the accessible poet illuminating the everyday world I was promised.  Instead, I found an extremely polished poet whose engaging tone almost makes up for his persistent lack of emotional depth.  Sentimentality may be a poetic sin, but sincerity isn't.    Even funny poems should display a little emotional risk.  But Collins never seems to risk anything.  And because he takes small risks, we get small rewards.    Go ahead and get this book.  Read it.  Smile a bit.  Appreciate the cleverness and talent Collins displays.  These poems are likeable, and I wouldn't be surprised if you liked them.  But if you are looking for poetry that will feed you, go somewhere else 
 This keyboard folds out well and I liked the feel of the keys.  However, the IR connector needs to be in direct connection with the IR port in the PDA.  For the iPaq, this port is at the bottom of the handheld.  The 210 degree arm does not rotate to this area.  In order to have the proper connectivity, you have to turn the handheld on its side.  This then requires another software program download (not freeware that I can find) to rotate your screen to the landscape view, unless you can read sideways without getting a headache.  Before buying this product, check your handheld to see if your IR port is between 4-8 o'clock - if so, this may be a difficult keyboard to use 
 My life is no longer run by fear.  After reading 20-30 conspirator books, I see nothing but some facts with weak links targeted to intelligent people that become an elitist to fight against other elitists.   Look at some of the major failures.  "Population bomb" predicted 1/2 the world starving to death by 1980.  Y2K embarrassment.  Rapture, baised on liberal and bad Bible theology.  Wise people need to spend their time with real people on local problems that are real and fixable.  
 I consider myself a music expert or something close to it. I own close to 10,000 albums. I say this because I hope that you will listen to some very good advice. Do not buy this album. Do not borrow it from the library. If you see it in the record store, look away as fast as you can. 'She used to be my girl' is the WORST song I have ever heard. That is taking into consideration all of the generic bubblegum pop, 80's hair metal, disco, and rock blands that I have had the misfortune to hear. To describe it as infinitely dreadful would be giving it too much credit. 'The O'Jays' should be ashamed and embarrassed that they are responsible for this miserable catastrophe of a 'song.' Daryl Hall & John Oates simply take 'worst' to a whole new low. Absolutely horrible! Hearing this song is like being forced to eat cow dung while suspended by your toe nails above a steaming pit of molten lead. Please, do not buy this album! (Rating: No stars whatsoever!)  
 Oh, my word, this book is simply terrible. We read it in my English class during my senior year of high school, and I absolutely hated it. I read it merely for the sake of my grade. It was difficult to visualize half the book, and the parts I did understand were just horrible. I hated how the boys shifted to such barbaric behavior on the island. And the author's writing style, no offense, was awful, with a capital "A". I sure was relieved when my class finished the book, and I made a vow to never read this book ever again, if I could help it. If you haven't read this book yet, then take my advice and stay far away from it. Don't waste your good money on such a shoddy product. 
 The basic idea of "Population 436," which is exactly what the film title says, sounds like one extended episode from "The Twilight Zone" or maybe "Star Trek." Some say they are impressed with the film's main idea, which I also liked. Another thing I can say about the film is that for all tis great idea its story might have worked better within the format of TV programs. "Population 436" is longer than it should be almost by 30 minutes, showing its hands too early in its storytelling, in fact, in its opening.   A census-taker Steve Kady (Jeremy Sisto) sent from Chicago is stranded in an isolated town of Rockwell Falls. He meets a young girl who is eager to listen to the world outside. He has a nightmare every night. He feels there's something strange going on in Rockwell Falls, where townspeople are all looking at him smilingly. All these things are familiar, but familiarity itself is not a big problem. But its poor storytelling is.  The film is directed by Michelle Maxwell MacLaren, whose previous works are mainly for TV, as producer. In spite of the film's decent photography and effective acting from the cast including Jeremy Sisto, almost everything is told in a wrong order. As I am not allowed to discuss the film's story in detail, I cannot reveal the premise of the film, of which implausibility is less damaging to the film compared with the slow-moving way it is revealed in the flat narrative. In other words, most people would predict what would happen quicker than the film thinks.  "Population 436" is a mildly entertaining thriller, of which clever idea is wasted by its half-baked script. 
 Just got the order of the CD from Amazon. Both the cover of the case and the cover of the CD is right: Under a Shady Tree. However, when we listen to it, it is totally different songs from different language!!! What the hell can that happen?! I don't even know if we can return it: since it is opened! But it is totally wrong songs!!! Could somebody help me here? How to contact Amazon? Thank you!! 
 Warning to parents: This DVD has new cover art and carries a release date of 2006 in the Amazon listing, which both lead you to believe that this is one of the new Paramount MLP releases.  Be warned that THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  This DVD is repackaged versions of two of the original 1980's Sunbow cartoons from the TV series.  As a parent, this means that they pre-date the FCC programming standards for children.  The content on this DVD is troubling if you care about positive modeling and concepts for your child.  In the first episode, the ponies are forcibly kidnapped and endure slave labor, and the bad guy cronnies plot to kill the evil princess.  In the second story, some of th ponies steal precious treasures from other peoples to bribe the bad troll.   And the original Subow art and animation was really crappy to boot!   If you're looking for the pro-message, thoughtful content of the recent paramount releases, this ain't it 
 Judging from the reviews below, I guess I'm in the minority.  I found some of her points good, but overall it seemed more advocacy that evidence.  (No, I don't work for the advertising industry.)  If you believe Ms. Schor, every conceivable problem with kids or teens can be traced to advertising.  Any everything is as bad now as its ever been.  If Ms. Shor was alive 50 years ago I'm sure her book would have been about the evils of Elvis Presley.  Doesn't that seem a bit overheated.  I can't possibly recall all the personal problems and social ills supposedly caused by advertising.  I'm sure I'll miss 30 or so but here's a shot.  Advertising causes in kids:  Obesity Aneroxia Bad body image Depression Stress Poor social skills Anxiety Alcohol abuse Illegal drug abuse Legal drug abuse Misogyny Racism Insensity to others Xenophobia Headaches Poor performance in school Apathy Lack of achievement Delinquency Rudeness Memory problems Poor memory skills  I could go on and on.  Gee, maybe some of these things have other causes?  As any teenager who has taken Psych 101 would say, "Duh."  
 Hands down, Lisa Loebs's best album (read: her only truly GREAT CD) is "Cake and Pie," so it would stand to reason that a fair share of the songs on a "best of" CD would be taken from that album. However, nearly HALF the songs on this hits CD are from Loeb's second album, the good (but nothing special) "Firecracker."   Who chose these songs? I mean, Loeb's three hits are included (a no-brainer), but much of the CD feels like arbitrary filler. "Let's Forget About It" and "Taffy" are highly forgettable, third-rate coffee-house pop (which is why they both flopped after being released as singles), while other songs like "Sandalwood" are boring tripe.   Where are the soaring guitars of "You Don't Know Me" and possibly Loeb's best song ever, "Someone You Should Know?" And at least one song from Loeb's stellar "Catch The Moon" CD would have been a great way to finish this "best of" collection! But instead fans get what is essentially Loeb's first two CDs' highlights with a few songs from other albums added in to make it a "best of" CD.  I am a huge Lisa Loeb fan, but this CD feels like it was just thrown together. I am very disappointed and, frankly, disgusted. Fans are better off with the regular albums and skipping this craptastic "best of" CD 
 This book is WAY past its pull date.  Full of warnings about not calling back the unrecognized number on your pager (pager?), the ease of using a consumer-grade scanner to evesdrop your cell phone calls (not since the cell network went digital!), and how you should shred paperwork with identifying information on it (duh!).  The over-riding assumption is that anyone with something to hide must be a criminal.  The reader is told to vary your hours, commute route, and habits so 'they' can't catch you, because you must be trying to get away with something.  For the rest of us law-abiding types, the message is "privacy is obsolete.  get over it."  Even worse, the author and the ghost-writer (this is one of those books by someone WITH someone else) must have been paid by the word.  It goes on and on and on, just to convey the merest morsel of a factoid.  But worst of all, the author is such a big shot, you're supposed to be really impressed with the names he drops and the James Bond-style exploits he pulled.  He walked right into office buildings after-hours and stole bags of trash!  He staked out the parking lot of the YMCA residence and guessed that the only non-hoopty in the lot belonged to the embezzeler!  He shoulder-surfed the old man in line in front of him at the bank to learn his identity!  Shaken-not-stirred stuff, you bet!  I have a lot of books on my shelf, and I don't mind reading a lot of pages to get a little information.  But this turkey yielded NO information of use, and so it went right back in the box and back to Amazon.  
 If you want to impress your friends with rope and knot tricks buy this book. If you were looking for a book that would actually assist you in rigging a sailboat ,save your money. Where is the info on standing  rigging?,wooden spars sailtracks, spreader placement ,masts head  configuration, boom vangs etc not in this book. This is just another book  for armchair sailors with very little for the average sailor trying to  build, modify, improve or just maintain their sailboat 
 It seems to me that a few people are giving this girl which ironically has the same name as me (our last names are just spelled differently) credit for a song that isn't even hers. Do you honestly think she wrote "Hey Joe???" I think not. Let's brush up on our music knowledge kids 
 With such wonderful illustrations, and a mostly enjoyable text, it's too bad that this book gets its inspiration from "Twas The Night Before Christmas". Jewish parents work hard teaching their children that Chanukah IS NOT the Jewish Christmas. This book doesn't help. There are much better choices out there 
 There are lots to like about this book. As the back cover says, it "captures the heat, the fury, and the intense human drama" of the Southern conflict. But I don't trust what the author presents as "facts."  That is, some of his research relies on books that relied on dubious 19th century writers. Which means that Lt. Colonel Banastre Tarleton is painted as pure evil, from the first page we meet him. Example: a couple of his men attacked some women at a plantation. Edgar writes, "Although several of the dragoons involved were disciplined, their commander was not." This gives the wrong impression of Tarleton's actions, or inactions, regarding this matter. Surely Edgar knows that Tarleton, when told of what had happened, sent a surgeon and 12 men to guard the women, and recommended hanging for these men. All in all, I'm left with the impression that the book sacrifices detail to paint a picture that isn't entirely accurate. Simply put, I'm unable to trust what I read. 
 The book seems to ramble back and forth in time and little is tied down. People are listed (Calabi & Yao - Yang & Mills and so on) But I have no idea of what they really added to SMT. No equations are given. It theories failed, IO have no idea why 
 Bennett book is underpinned by fear and loathing.  He blames parties not responsible for the so-called collapse of the family and of morality.  Self-righteous myopic heterosexuals like himself need to take stock of their own role in what ever de-evolution they perceive.  Stop scapegoating minorities 
 I realize that this is supposed to be an introductory book, however it does not provide enough detail to be very useful in my 2nd year inorganic chem class. I am extremely disappointed by this since the book costs so much money. I wonder how much more it would cost if it was hardcover.   It does have a good layout and bright pictures and colors though. I guess this is supposed to stimulate the brain or something 
 The game itself is very interesting - the storyline is engaging and the controls are unique.  It's an RPG, which is quite a switch for Mario.  The major problem with this game is interactivity - not enough of it.  Specifically, there are far too many cutscenes that are not skippable.  Many of these cutscenes lead directly into a boss battle.  The most frustrating instance of this is just before the final boss battle - it takes about 10 minutes to get to the "real" fight from the prior save point.  This isn't a problem for the first time through the sequence, but if you lose 4 or 5 times, this just becomes a hassle and makes the game not really worth playing to see the end.  This is a major problem that most game designers have found work-arounds for, but Nintendo revealed its lack of RPG experience in this element.  It's an interesting game, but just make sure to win, or have a friend/sibling/(enemy?) skip through the dialog sequences for you if you get tired of them 
 This is an okay product with many, many parts to clean.  The spout, the ring for the top of the cup, the handles, and the plastic "leak stopper", oh, and the cup!  All the parts fly around the dishwahser.  I've lost many stoppers so I've had to order through Avent.  The good thing is they don't leak.  
 First of all, I did not exactly 'read' this biography. Instead I purchased the CD version which I distilled via my car sound system every morning on my way to work (I have enjoyed countless biographies of great american figures this way, and still been able to read many more technology related books).  I had great expectations from this book, having recently enjoyed three biographies of Lincoln. I have to confess that I was sorely disapointed. I found the research of Mr McCullough to lack the kind of details that I have enjoyed in biographies from Walter Isaacson, Richard Carwardine, or Doris Goodwin. I do not seek a beautiful story in a biography, but rather a reliable source of facts that I can use to form my own opinion of a character. In this context, I find Mr McCullough's use of superlatives or long emotionally charged sentences to be a distraction from the subject matter of John Adams and his contribution to America. I also enjoy direct quotes from letters, speaches, autobiographies, as they help me refine my impressions of the context (the period, the relationships to contemporary characters, ...) surounding a promonent figure. Usage of the English language in politics has dramatically evolved since Mr Adams' time, and I missed 'hearing' the voice of John Adams. Instead, this biography felt like reading a translation where the personality of the translator overshadows the personality of the original author. Finally, having read other biographies of the founding fathers, I was disapointed to find so little about the complex relationship between Adams and Franklin.  All in all, my lasting impression is that Mr McCullough did a great job at bringing John Adams and the early American Revolution to the masses through a very appealling product that may however leave readers asking for more historical details and less emotional opinions. Had I known that, I might have passed on this biography and instead explore Mr McCullough's fictional work 
 Goldwater's disastorous 1964 Presidential campaign is the vehicle for telling the book's real story: the rise of the ultra-conservative movement in American politics in the sixties. It is undoubtedly an important story, and one that Perlstein has researched considerably. However, Perlstein's work is undone not by his findings, or his damaging portrayal of the burgeoning right-wing movement -- I concur with him on these points -- but by very lazy presentation. Perlstein has obvioulsy drunk deep at the David Halberstam well. He can rattle off an anecdote, but he is dreadfully prolix. The book is at least two hundred pages too long. No reader opening a book on sixties politics needs an eight-hundred word summary of Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. Perlstein has also made a mess in organising his material; he leaps back and forth, from person to person, without ever stitching the requisite parts together. One moment Henry Cabot Lodge looks to be the certain favourite for the 1964 Republican nomination, and we are treated to fifteen pages on the organisation of his campaign; later we are told, almost as an aside, that he has withdrawn from the race, and Perlstein never explains why. Sam Tannehaus's 'Whittaker Chambers' is a much more assured analysis of the growth of anti-communist hysteria in the fifties and sixites, and is considerably shorter and better crafted than Perlstein's book. A more thorough editor and an author more intent on telling the story carefully and well would have made 'Before the Storm' a much better book than it is 
 The first four songs are very good, extremely catchy. Unfortunately the last 8 aren't, in fact they are down right awful. I like Gwen, she's probably the most beautiful woman in the world but she should have stuck with No Doubt. 
 The cover of the CD, which provided the inspiration for the album title and song according to the liner notes, shows an industrial wasteland created by communists in the former Soviet empire. The back cover shows a defaced billboard which mocks the United States of America and its position in the world.  The contradiction provided by the juxtaposition of these images is lost on Gilkyson and shows the level of sophistication one might expect from someone with only a high school education like her.  The opening song, "Hiway 9," uses the melody and tempo of a children's song to support a frivolous political commentary.  This includes the racist attack that, Colin Powell, one of this country's greatest public servants, is "a white man hidden in a black man's skin."  Charming, especially considering that Gilkyson's family comes from the Philadelphia Social Register.  Things don't get much better from there with the usual puerile lyrics (Not Lonely, Wonderland, Separated) about longing for love and lust, which are getting a little odd coming from a 50 year old woman who has had more than her share of lovers.  The third cut, "Dark Side of Town," is about one of her sister's innumerable boyfriends, a substance abuser who died recently of compications from Hep C.  The album is dedicated to him at end of the liner notes.  Great, that's inspiring to us all Eliza!  The song Tender Mercies starts off with words of sympathy for a suicide bomber who kills Jews at an Israeli shopping mall.  Once again, the deeper meaning of such an act is lost to Eliza.  Elsewhere, the "Milk and Honey" track manages to be pompous and trite at the same time while attempting profundity, and a children's song from her father is included.  The closing Woody Guthrie tune is far and away the best thing on the album.  It harks back to a time when those on the political left and right in this country could unite to fight Woody's favorite enemy: facists.  Too bad Gilkyson and her ilk don't even recognize the problem today, just like the isolationists in the 30s.  As she says in "Milk and Honey" - "god's children....doomed to repeat history. 
 Tonight I saw Mr. Chopra on television.  I was stunned at seeing a man who hardly looked healthy never mind younger or ageless!!!  Common folks, put two and two together.  Why can't he produce the effects he promises and makes you pay for such empty promises.  My Dr. friend was correct about Chopra finding a way to milk folks for tons of money!  The shocking part was the man who carries an air of such lofty spirituality displayed little spirituality on the TV.  He was not only bloated looking but so was his attitude, full of criticism for Western thought, Christianity, America's foreign policy etc.  I am not saying we are perfect or there isn't room for criticism but he was full of criticism with nothing good to say about what is worth acknowleging at the Western culture.  He had to set himself up as the one voice of enlightenment....it sells more books, healing appts, lecturers, etc.   I copied a portion of what another reviewer wrote because it shows the level of superiority in attitude and the traversty of such actions upon real dialouge, the kind of arrogance that came across by Chopra on tv tonight. Before finishing want to say,  It's ok to want to make a fortune only don't wear false spirituality to do so. In the early 70's I went to the Marharishi (?) Meditation Center in NY where they charged $200 for the mantra, the same mantra they undoubtedly recycled a billizion times, asking the initiate not to share the secret mantra!  I was so young and naive.  Then there was Baghwan (?) with the fleet of Roll Royces and a hefty bank acct. He had followers hand over the deeds to their homes for the price of enlightenment, of course they did so willing based on what they were made to believe! That guy feed into the human desire of some, to let go and feel it was ok to do whatever they want...endless sex, drugs etc...no judgment. All this done in the name of being more spiritual, enlightened than the rest of us! Chicanery comes in many forms, only in searching for the NEW often people ignore the obvious deception that is right in front of them. End  "Having worked with a large number of cancer patients through the years, following their fears and struggles, it seems like an insult to ordinary humble workers to say "Reprogram your quantum mind and get rid of the cancer". If Chopra could show one case of a person who could do this, including himself, I`d be willing to change my view of this as a condescending way to treat suffering humans who need compassion and good palliative care, not easy solutions that give the responsibility to the patient, whereas the doctor stands with no soil of the human factor on his hands. This is a travesty of the Hippocratic ideal, and will strengthen the view of alternative doctors as superficial, money-loving peddlers of false hopes. 1 star rating is inevitable, I hate to say. Luckily, there are many good sources of the same knowledge that Chopra embezzles. (Hope I haven`t been too harsh, I have no wish to attack Chopra, but I wish to strengthen a more substantial approach to the issues of aging, health and dying). 
 Okay, I read this book end-to-end. Disappointing though. The contents are not close to what you find in the Project+ exam. The heading, subheading and paragraphs are not coherent and they do not tie together. It is hard to find out, in few paragraphs, what author is trying to tell. Chapter summaries are disorganized and sometime do not cover what is in the chapter. Some of the figures do not make sense (see figure 6-5 on page 189...do you really need to create a figure to tell Arguments take a project off schedule and increase costs) 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 Very poor book, realy a waste of time. The review below said it all 
 This wasn't a particularly good overview of the securitization market.  It focusses on cash U.S. mortgage backed securities 
 Leslie West is a fine guitar player but this "blues" record is over the top in terms of guitar tone - consistently saturated (think Neil Young and Crazy Horse at their craziest or Tommy Iommi).  It sounds like he took a Mesa Boogie Triple Rectifier amp and turned everything to 11. I don't know about you, but I like a little nuance with my blues and that word is not in Leslie's vocabulary.  When I listened to this, I thought how great it would be if he would make another Mountain record.  Unfortunately, "Never in My Life" does not translate into the blues.  Skip this release and get "Leslie West Live!", his 1993 record.  
 an amazingly bad movie. eddie murphy (who was funny in the 80s) manages the near-impossible: he makes jerry lewis seem sophisticated. now dont get me wrong; i love stupid comedy -- when its funny. murphy never convinces an iota here in the role of the HUGE professor klump. there is scads of humor to be mined in the struggles of fat people to fit into the normal world (take my word, i know about THAT) -- just recall oliver hardy's girth getting him stuck in a doorway during his attempt to escape bogeyland -- but murphy is merely contemptuous and nasty. well, contemptuous and nasty in a comedy i can accept, but it better be funny. this movie has a high spot on my list of the 10 worst i have ever seen. 
 FLCL is THE WORST anime of all time, and possibly the worst thing to come out of Japan since the Pearl Harbor attacks, and the soundtrack is just as bad, if not worse.  Its nothing more than J-pop mixed with bad Japanese rock.  Bad guitar playing, boring drum beats, and inaudible bass; you've heard one Pillows song, you've heard them all.  Only "otakus" with no life love this s*** (like Matthew G. Salisbury).  If you want good Japanese music, go for King's Evil.  PS, that album cover is possibly the worst ever made 
 These are very well made shears - but they arrived dull, and were unable to cut hair.  After an additional 6$ sharpening they do work fine 
 It plainly states on MY copy of this CD that Phil Spector chose to master this in analog, NO digital remastering. That is why the sound quality is so VERY poor for the beauty and power of these songs and this artist group, and Phil's own powerful production! His choice, not ABCKO. Walt Schult 
 I know that everyone wants to hear how great a movie is.  Well, I can't say The Thin Red Line is a great movie.  On a scale of 1-5 I gave it a 2.    Maybe my expectations were too high.  After all, I bought this movie after watching Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, and A Bridge Too Far.  So, I was expecting The Thin Red Line to be on that level.  After all, with 7 Academy Award Nominations including Best Picture, a cast that includes many of the top names in Hollywood, and a huge budget, the bar was set pretty high.  And I guess if you're into artsy, "message" films The Thin Red Line will be what you're looking for.  But, if you're looking for a "war" movie you can forget it.  Buy When Trumpets Fade or Saving Private Ryan if you're looking for action.  Or better yet, splurge for the Band of Brothers set.  You'll seldom make such a wise investment if you're really interested in knowing what happened.  I'm just not interested in watching a World War 2 movie that appears more interested in all this sort of introspective business.  Save that for Dr. Phil.  I've warned you.  If you're into history and World War 2 in particular, rent this before you buy it.  Seriously. 
 I am not a right winger whatsoever, am against our involvement in the Mid East but did read this book. I can't say it better than Alan Dershowitz who commented about Chomsky's writing in general: many people buy his books and the page that is folded down is never greater than page 16 
 This is easily the WORST casebook I have ever owned. LOUSY for learning future interest and possessory estates. LOUSY for learning mortgages. LOUSY for learning adverse possession. Mainly lousy, lousy, lousy. Don't buy this book without purchasing a hell of a study aid b/c you won't learn jack from it since it's horribly written. Don't buy this book w/out purchasing a hell of a good pair of reading glasses b/c the print is practically microscopic. I can't believe I have to suffer through another property course w/this terrible book 
 I was forced to read this book for school and literally fell asleep a few times reading it. There is no excitement or adventure in the storyline and reading it just makes you feel more drowsy with every page turn. Who wants to read about a self-centered jerk who barely gets any better throughout the course of the book? Not me! If there was a list of the worst books ever written this would remain the chart-topper for eternity!!!!!! 
 I am a wedding planner and an instructor at the local college. I was looking for a book to use as a "textbook" for the wedding planner class and based on previous editions (I own the 2nd, 4th, and 5th editions), I chose the sixth edition for my class before actually reading it. I thought this book was the Bible of wedding planning. Beverly Clark is one of the most renowned wedding experts out there and always has written very thorough and detailed books. I must say I was VERY DISAPPOINTED with the latest edition however. The book took out several chapters, left out key information, and inserted very little new information other than references to their new website, where the reader is forced to be exposed to their annoying banner advertising. Despite my previous enthusiasm for Beverly Clark, I must say I would NOT recommend this book. There are so many others out there to choose from. I must say, if you are a bride, you should go to a bookstore and choose one that suits you and your wedding style, rather than purchasing from a website, where you can't really tell what the book is like 
 While some consequences for the backtalk make sense like taking away a priviledge or cancelling a special outing, there are some that seem extremely selfish on the parent's part and can affect more than just your child. According to this author, if your child backtalks right before he is to perform a solo in a school band concert you should discipline him by refusing to take him to the concert. You should call up all the relatives that were going to attend the concert and tell them not to come. As for the entire band and the band director that were counting on that solo as part of the performance, you should tell them that it's not your fault he wasn't there, but your child's for backtalking. In what universe is it acceptable to ruin the entire performance for a band (often consisting of a dozen to a hundred kids) and embarrassing a band director because you were unwilling to think of a less selfish punishment? According to his book, he says you as a parent shouldn't even care how it affects the rest of the world! They just have to deal with it! That seems as immature and rude as the backtalk he says you should eliminate 
 Choice of words, writing style and teaching of biology is NOT satisfactory in this book.  Not a good way to learn CELL bio, maybe functional at higher levels but definitely not useful in explaining new concepts.  Occassionally the sentences do not even seem properly formed. i.e. fragments and more often ultra-run on sentences with no structure and no clarity.  Frustration - the emotion experienced while reading this book.   
 A friend recommended this book to me when I became pregnant.  I really cannot recommend anybody to buy this book if you want to get a realistic idea of what pregnancy is going to be.  If you follow her advice to not work out anymore and eat for two, yes, you will indeed outgrow your husbands cloths.  That was actually the end of reading for me 
 I read "Epicenter" with the expectation of obtaining objective, fact-based new insights on the troubled situation in the Middle East.  Instead, the book was a cover-to-cover one-sided diatribe against all those who either already oppose Israel (eg. Iran), or those who may in the near future (eg. Russia).  Rosenberg is entitled to his opinion; however, simply "believing" does not make it true, nor does bias help resolve problems.  Examples:  Rosenberg is correct in pointing out Palestinian and Islamic faults; however, he "forgets" about Israel's - eg. taking Palestinian land, killing and otherwise abusing Palestinians, or the U.S.'s - unrestricted international support for almost EVERYTHING Israel does, as well as extensive financial and military assistance.  Then as an afterthought, Rosenberg criticizes Palestinians for reacting to Sharon's sudden visit to a Jerusalem site revered by Muslims as well as Jews, accompanied by hundreds of Israeli police and his own hated reputation for prior slaughters.  Again, Russia (and perhaps China as well) may further complicate the Mid-East situation in the near future - on the other hand, the U.S. would do well to stop chastising Putin et al, especially after our "experts" severely weakened Russia's economy through advice that also allowed oligarchs to take advantage of increased democracy to loot much of the nation's wealth.  Then there is the matter of our invading Iraq on false pretenses.  Further, the rest of the world is well aware of the U.S.'s human rights abuses in Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib, and various rendition locations, as well as the abuses of our election processes.  As a result, our constantly scolding and lecturing them does not encourage cooperation in areas such as the Mid-East.  As for Iran - President Ahmadinejad does bring considerable cause for worry - but doesn't our invading Iraq on false pretenses create an initial cause for their concern, or our prior overthrow of their elected government to install the Shah?  And what about Cheney/Bush refusing to negotiate with Iran pre-Ahmadinejad on its nuclear program (we wanted to dictate, not negotiate), or Bush's condemning Iran (Axis of Evil) only a month after it helped in Afghanistan?  (The latest - Bush's refusal to ask Iran for help vs. Iraq until it ceases its nuclear program displays idiotic logic.)  It was interesting to read that Ahmadinejad is looking for an Islamic version of the apocalypse, but how is this different from all the evangelicals in the U.S. that are trying to bring about a Biblical version?  Finally, Rosenberg gets around to the current situation in Iraq.  "When one views Iraq's future through the third lens of Scripture, a much different picture emerges" - "strong, stable, and decisive central government" etc., etc.  If only the Bible were as clear and credible (vs. other religions) as Rosenberg thinks 
 I was looking for a book that would give me guidance to diet, not one that was meant to analysis my feelings like going to a head doctor. It was a  real disappointment and a waste of my hard earned money. Other books by the  Heller's are of more benefit 
 I thought Jeff's writings were very good but Ruth's were boring and difficult to get through. I skipped most of hers. The concept of the story is great but the pace is too slow and it didn't hold my intererst, but I did manage to get through the whole thing. 
 Having been diagnosed with breast cancer in February 2000, and feeling that I too was a "Feisty Woman," I bought Elaine's book.  I was quickly alarmed to find that her ideas of being "Feisty" were to challenge all medical standards and decline proven treatment.  This may have been the correct decision for her (I hope that it was) but I find it unconscionable for her to suggest that other women do the same. There are too many variables and too much data that seems to have dismissed, to call her suggestions objective and well-thought out. If you must, then please: Read With Care! In the case of this book, "Feisty" could mean "Fatal.&quot 
 I was completely disappointed with this book. It works with tutorials of simple PSD  shape files. I am a newbie at After Effects but I heard so much but how it interacts 100% with Premiere Pro and Adobe Photoshop that I expected more of that in that book. There is no reference on how to mask Alpha Channels of PSD files or even in depth interaction with Photoshop.  I know that this is a begginers book but at least by the end we could have something more advanced 
 There are three significant problems with this book. "Made in Detroit," is poorly written. Clemens thinks, "went over like a led balloon," is a fine simile. It is not. But Clemens begs his readers to compare him to Baldwin, Hemmingway, and others, a desperate attempt for sophistication he is unlikely to ever gain. (2) Clemens' book is racist and anti-working class to the core. Clemens clearly adopted his fathers' hatred of unions, and formed his own uncritical take on racism, expecting readers to chuckle at his portrayal of African Americans as "moolies." (3) Clemens knows nearly nothing important about Detroit. He views the city through an inverted telescope, each lens juncture narrowing his already myopic view; racism, sexism, the meanest forms of conservative Catholicism, his unexamined views of exploitation and resistance, all merge to give him a key-hole view of, not the city, but himself, his trifling family relationships, and his trembling edicts about his wife-who, I know from experience, is all aflutter about his critics. There are good books about Detroit, like "Whose Detroit?" or "American Odyssey" by Conot (openly fictional, unlike Clemens' piece), or Ewens, "Corporate Power and Urban Crisis," or Mirel's "Rise and Fall of an Urban School System." Clemens work is, flatly, too small-minded to be taken seriously. Only the fact that racism sells could lead local reviewers, and the publisher, to push this book. For those who seek my longer review of Clemens book, google "Michigan Citizen , Made In Detroit." I am the San Diego State prof critiqued in a review below. 
 I borrowed Changing Minds from the library looking for a foray into the science of altering opinion. The book is mostly write ups that are not supported.As other reviews say 'where is the proof? 
 what a shame.  c.a. was such a talented and beautiful young woman but apparently got some horrible career advice.  maybe she wanted to be this way, but most likely, it was a manager, or record company trying to create a even more slutty successor to britney spears.  more is not always better, and in this case, it is definitely worse.  hopefully, she banked her $$, cuz i can't imagine that she'll ever recover from this debacle.  that would be as likely as a porn star trying to make it in hollywood.  very sad 
 I ordered 2 round ones and 2 square ones and they sent me 3 square and one round. Not worth my while to return but disappointed nonetheless 
 I have three young kids and have read hundreds of children's books. Rock Steady appears to have been written by someone who was intoxicated. This book does not make sense. It is poorly written. I can see no purpose in writing a book this bad let alone purchase it. I have thrown my copy in the trash 
 What a pile of junk.  Three full seconds pass between pushing the shutter button and when the camera actually takes the picture.  If you move at all during that three seconds, the picture is a blurred mess.  Even if you don't move, the pictures turn out blurry and dark.  And if you use the flash, you get a lovely white picture of nothing.  I can't believe they sell this thing. 
 I think that I am clearly insane, but I did not like this book. Everyone else in the world likes this book, but i am the insane person who does not. And I'm NOT sarcastic! I could barly read it a second time. I hated this book. 
 The story of Wim Wenders' "Wings of Desire" is told through images and thoughts.  Abandon all expectations of seeing anything resembling a conventional film before watching it.      Two angels glide through the streets of Berlin surveying its inhabitants.  Cassiel (Otto Sander) embraces his role as witness but Damiel (Bruno Ganz) wants to break free of his ethereal existence.  He is willing to cast aside his immortality in order to experience the simple joys of everyday life.  The primary catalyst for his desire to change is his attraction to trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin).   "Wings of Desire" does not quite work.  It stumbles not because it is too pretentious or too ponderous.  Rather, it stumbles because it is just too abstract.   Relying on imagery and monologues to tell a story makes for an interesting lesson in unconventional filmmaking, but it also leads to frustration and annoyance to anyone conditioned to more traditional narratives.  "Wings of Desire" deserves a lot of credit for its innovative approach toward its material and its beautiful dream-like visuals.  Yet, it is a film that unfortunately will not appeal much to the mainstream viewer.  
 The material is fine. They cover most of the basics. However, I found the book to be extremely repetitious. They would often say the same thing over and over, page after page. It was comical really. The book could easily have been edited down to half its size.  The construction of the book lacked any organization at all. I got the feeling that the many topics in it were written at different times and slapped together when it was time to put it together for publishing. You could just as easily read it from back to front because there really is no flow to the book.  I also had a problem with this Abraham thing. It was kind of a turnoff really. I understand it's a nice marketing angle, but enough already. I hope no one out there really believes that this info came from some supernatural entity. It's too bad, really; the writers seem knowledgable enough to have written on this subject without the need for a gimmick. 
 I'm an engineer and I cannot believe that any company would, in good conscience, fob off such trash onto the consuming public.  The reasons for the faulty performance are all based on fatally flawed design.  A product with this many problems does not reach the market by accident.  They had to have known it was junk, but chose to sell it anyway.  Dirt Devil deserves the strongest form of rebuke and condemnation 
 I'm not Catholic, but I was interested in learning about any evidence disproves the theories set forth in The DaVinci Code,so that I would understand their opposition to the book.   I thought this book would give me an objective view of the historic facts that The Davinci Code was based on, instead, it denied the theories using mostly beliefs as their supporting evidence.    I was disappointed because I had a hard time learning, from an academic perspective, why the Catholic church might have been falsely represented in this book 
 I have the same jacket in black but I bought this from elsewhere. What a rip off it is. It is made in china and the feather keeps on coming and on a given day I had to remove atleast 20- 25 of the feathers since they peek so much. I doubt how long this is going to last as eventually it will be a skinny jacket without the feathers.!!! Do not BUY  
 I bought this book hoping to get some insight about Mj's years with the Wizards. I was left dissapointed. The author seems to be intent in portraying MJ in a negative light. He does not have quotes to back up some of his words. A lot of the facts are wrong. I understand that, while writing a negative book about Jordan would be different from the normal bioographies out there, the book has to be HONEST. And this is far from honest. As i mentioned before, A LOT of his facts were not true. He blames MJ for the businesses decisions that were made. What he forgets to mention, is that Abe Collins has the final say in any decision. ( He admitted this himself ). Also, how can you say that Jordan's third coming wasn't successful? He had better numbers than lakers superstar Kobe Bryant ( per 48 mins ). The bottom line is that, Leahu is another author trying to make some money by writing a negative book about Jordan. he jsut doesn't have enough negative material, and ends up resorting to lies. Trully disappointing. 
 This is actually 2.5.  These 2 books are fantasy novels set in a human prehistory in which magic exists.  The twist to this idea is that magic is based on a naturally occurring but non-renewable resource called manna (what else).  In some ways, this is an attempt at an allegory of contemporary dependence on petroleum products. Against the backdrop, Niven and Pournelle set a series of stories about a period when manna is really drying up.  The first book, The Burning City, is a bildungsroman about a young man growing up in a relatively magicless community with an unusual social structure and his later adventures in the greater world.  The second book, Burning Tower, is a quest story in which the heroes, related to the heroes of The Burning City, search for powerful wizards manipulating magic in a malignant way.   These are not particularly well written books.  Plots are haphazardly developed, characterization is weak, and good descriptive writing is conspicuous by its absence.  The Burning City, in particular, is marred by some poorly developed allegory.  Neither Niven nor Pournelle are gifted writers though some of their previous work, both individually and in collaboration, is considerably better than either of these books.  Neither of these books come close to matching their best work, The Mote in God's Eye, a very good novel.  Given these deficiencies, the books succeed or fail on the authors' ability to weave traditional mythology and prehistory into their premise. Here, they are only modestly successful.  Their use of mythic elements is relatively superficial.  I can recommend these books only to hard core Niven-Pournelle fans, and then only if they purchase these books at a discount. 
 When I bought "The Draco Tavern" by Larry Niven it was rated "4.5" or "5" on Amazon reviews.  I was disappointed; it seemed more like a "1" or "2".  Larry Niven has written great short stories in the past, but these stories aren't worthy of his name 
 so this is a message to the two amazon sellers that are trying to flog it for $2,475.00 or $190. Are they insane. No ones going to buy a book at that price you morons. Lower it to $20 and I'll buy it right now, god dammit. Or do you want me to suffer a really painfull suicide because I havent got the tecnique under wraps. Hey i might even fail and end up brain damaged or paralized. Then what the hell am I gonna do? They dont sell guns on my little Island.   
 The book is a typical how I changed my life and you can too by making me some more money.  After reading the book and listening to a couple of his songs, the only person he cares about is himself. 
 How many books can she write that are the same information, only with a genre-specific twist? First she writes a general TV book and then she writes a book on sitcom writing - BOTH using this utterly stupid "roadmap" model. I've even been dumb enough to plunk money down on her live seminar in which she essentially reads from her own book. She latched on to this "roadmap" notion like a pitbull a LONG time ago and she STILL can't let go.  THEN she has the utter gall to write yet another book, this time applying the same hackneyed techniques to the field of animation writing.  When I was in college, using the same paper for three different classes would have been considered plagarizing oneself. It's amazing that her publisher hasn't caught on...  Save your money. Or buy Jefferey Scott's book. 
 I'm facinated by business and marrying the Kingdom of God to the topic of business really captured my attention. I couldn't wait to read the book. Each chapter was dissapointing with few, new thoughts. I think college students and those new to business may find this useful but those who have already spent much time in business or considering how business and the glory of God go together may not find much new to chew on here. I believe the author is a professor and not a businessman--which may be why he didn't deliver as much as I had hoped 
 I like Metallica first of all. But this was their worst release along with Kill Em All. All the songs on this album are really horrendous. Metallica only made about a few good albums, want to get one???? Get Master of Puppets, Black, and Ride The Lightning. They all have about 3-7 good songs. This album is a waste!!!! Get those albums insted 
 With the announcement of the "My friends and me" project I could hardly wait to own a copy of the CD.  At first this was supposed to be a double CD project including both male and female artists.  I guess project plans change and that I accept.  I recently received a copy this CD via Amazon and am terribly disappointed by the quality of the baking.  As one reviewer rightfully stated "it sounds like a Karaoke backtrack".  I also get the impression that the production of this project was done on the cheap side given the quality of the backing.  Although Dionne put a lot of faith in her son producing this CD I'm of the opinion that a more experienced producer should have taken the lead.  A full orchestra as backing would also do more justice to Dionne's voice.  I think however that the personal attack by some reviewers on Dionne's vocal ability is a bit unfair.  Take the vocals and back it up with a proper orchestra and you will hear the difference.  Unfortunately the terrible backing is so overpowering that one cannot help but cringe when you listen to the CD.  Should I recommend this CD to other people?  Well...  1) To Dionne all fans: Buy the CD, its certainly one of Dionne's poorer projects, however, you will always wonder if you should have bought it or not.  2) To people who do not mind Dionne's music but do not label themselves as fans: Rather purchase recordings of Dionne that dates back to the 80's, 90's and early 00's.  You will begin to appreciate this TITANIC of a talent much more.  The "My friends and me" CD might just do damage to casual listeners perception of Dionne.  3) To the new generation wanting to purchase their first Dionne album:  See point number two.  I not only purchased a copy for me but another one for a good friend as a Christmas gift.  I'm a bit embarrassed to give him a CD of this quality as a gift and rather decided to buy him something else instead.  I hope that Concord will take cognisance of the reviews and make the necessary changes when they start working on "My friends and me" 2 & 3.  Take Care  Riaan - South Africa 
 This is really cool. It is a bratz stage. It is unessisery to play with but it does make it funner. I reccomend this to all. It can also go with Bratz Rock Angels Recording Studio Playset and Bratz Rock Angelz Band Instrumentz Playset. Rock angelz are the best of all bratz. This completes my collection of Rock angel bratz. In my opinion, this is the best. have you noticed it is also the most expensive though? use ebay to save $$$ (hint hint!) This is not educational at ALL dont worry, it doen't teach music 
 After really liking the Bourne Identity movies I figured I'd pick out a Ludlum novel because it would be good.  I got this from the library to check out and figured it would be a good read while I was on vacation.  I was very disappointed.  I barely got through it, but it helped me get to sleep so I plugged on.  First off, to reload a pistol you use a MAGAZINE, it's not a clip.  To hear some super special forces secret agent type calling it a clip takes all credibility away from the author to me.  It is soooo painfully obvious that the writer Gayle lynds has done no research whatsoever into weapons or combat and has never fired a firearm.  If you're going to write an action/thriller type novel, at least write like you somewhat know what you're talking about.  An MP5 is not going to slam anybody's body back like a sack of rice, it fires 9mm rounds.  Bullets do not push people back, not even a little bit, unless it's from a cannon of some sort or some other huge weapon designed to attack tanks or buildings.  Also, nobody is ever going to win and/or escape any firefight when they're armed with a 9mm Glock and a 9mm Beretta and they are facing off against a force that outnumbers them 6 to 1 and is armed with assault rifles.  The writing was poor, the dialogue was unrealistic, and it is littered with things that just make the author lose credibility (clips).  I will give Ludlum another chance by reading another novel, but Gayle Lynds is a very poor writer.  And what is up with her constant use of the word "too".  She has sentences like "And I better get over to the building, too."  Why is there a comma there Gayle, it doesn't sound right.  It should be "I'll get over to the building too."  It takes away the choppiness.  I did not get the sense at all that the main character was tough, it was clearly written by somebody that has never done any of the things she writes about.  Seeing that such poor writing gets published is actually a good thing, it gives me hope for my novel.  I give this book 2 stars, and overall rating of "Extreme Cheese".  
 I found nothing of value in this book. If you are looking for a newer sales model, you would be better off looking at Unlock the Game by Ari Galper. 
 Our hero,amoral in his love life, refusing to kick his unfaithful ex-wife to the curb, and making mystery solving boring, why continue? Parker can write like no one else, but his recent plots suggest the well may be dry 
 This anthology comes off rather badly in comparison to ENGLISH RENAISSANCE DRAMA: A NORTON ANTHOLOGY edited by David Bevington. Missing in action are Tamburlaine and The Jew of Malta by Marlowe, The Tragedy of Mariam by Elizabeth Cary, The Alchemist by Ben Jonson, The Maid's Tragedy by Beaumont and Fletcher, The Roaring Girl by Middleton and Dekker, Women Beware Women by Middleton, and The White Devil by Webster--classic works all 
 I bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses.  There must be a quality control problem.  My bottle had no noticible, pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair.  I was only trying to go 1 day without washing.  What a disappointing product and a waste of my money.  : 
 Sorry to be the wet blanket at this book party, but I was very disappointed in this book.  First of all, here is a case of what I call 'book padding'--an author repeating himself frequently and dragging in material that has no real relation to the subject--all in the interest of filling up pages.  Had the author deleted most of his repetitive material, and all the extraneous matter having to do with the singing group Peter, Paul, and Mary, this book would probably be less than 100 pages.  As it is now, the reader has to skim through endless repetitions, and also the author's feeble attempts to somehow connect the book to a folk singing trio.  Printing the lyrics to 'If I Had a Hammer' in a book dealing with three New Testament characters is just plain silly.  If you think the book is 'brilliant,' that is probably because you agree with the author's deep skepticism about the New Testament.  Liberals will like this, conservatives won't.  I read this book not because I expected to agree with the author (although I tried to keep an open mind), but because I was wondering how he would deal with the various legends that sprang up around the three characters in the title.  For me this was the meat of the book--but again, he repeats himself endlessly.  The valid point that the Bible tells us very little about Mary Magdalene is worth stating, but not repeating a dozen times.  I'm thankful I did not actually buy this book.  It is certainly not worth the cost 
 Ok... I get where the other review authors are coming from here, giving this DVD, particularly Troll 2 five stars and a MUST BUY status... irony and sarcasm, and I do understand their views. I thought I'd keep it real though.   Ok, so I bought this double feature DVD for the sole purpose of finally ridding myself of the crappy VHS copy of Troll (1) standing in my shelf beside all the other DVDs. I was surprised that there actually was a sequel to this movie, which, in my book is an 80s classic. Little did I know the horrible truth that was about to unravel before me on the screen. For Troll 2 has to be, THE crappiest movie AND the crappiest sequel EVER made! I don't even know where to start explaining, so that you good people who read this will realize the Supreme suck factor of Troll 2.  All the usual clichees like "low budget" and "bad acting" simply don't suffice! Low budget, for one, is not even synonymous to bad movies. Troll 2 is almost beyond MST3K material. I don't know how else to explain it. Instead I can only ramble on. It's almost like you SHOULD watch this movie if not only for the purpose of study. A study of the precision with which they have managed avoid everything...ANYTHING that makes a good movie. My only comfort is that Troll 2 doesn't relate to the original Troll in any way. Another thing that saves this DVD is that it's cheap, and Troll (1) is actually worth the price. I just wish that Troll 1 would be available on a DVD of its own. The sequel is a damned insult 
 Everything is fine, everything is OK. The simplest answer is the most likely.  Conspiracies are made up by left-wing wackos with nothing to do.  Did Iran-Contra ("Ask about the cocaine!"), Tuskegee, MK-ULTRA, Latin American germ warfare, Bay of Pigs, Allende overthrow, CIA LSD research of the 50s, '66 NY subway experiment, and the Arbenz coup in Guatemala all happen?  No they didn't.  Oliver North acted alone and was deranged and crazy.  E. Howard Hunt was a deranged loner who tried to kill Castro.  Uncle Sam was a crazy deranged lunatic that give African Americans syphilis in 1932.  He acted alone.  God bless America.  I love our leader.  The more than fifty people that died after the Kennedy assassination all committed suicide.  They were distressed by Oswald's murder of Kennedy and could not go on living.  Shame on you Mr. Oswald.  I love you Mr. Posner.  You're a lot better than that Oswald guy.  Mr. Posner: would you please write a book debunking the claims of The Chuch of the Sub-Genius?  JR Bob Dobbs is a nut and must be stopped.  God bless you and your people 
 We all know European monarchs and royals were bunch of perverts. So, as an astute student of dishing the dirt on historical figure, I picked up this book. I was ready for some sick stuff that would make Monica Lewinski's dress look sanitary.   I was wrong. This book is too nice. Stories were filtered and all you get is a glimpse of those sick people and their dirty deeds.   Not worth your time and money. Move on to the next one on your list 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 I usually like James Patterson but this book was absolutely horrible. Not only was it hard to follow, but I never ended up caring about any of the characters. I can't believe he was able to get this published AND win an award. I guess I just don't get it 
 I had a very hard time getting through the 154 pages and almost couldn't make it.  Without a doubt Howard knows a lot about WWI, but he does not write in a way that I can enjoy reading him.  It took me a long time to finish this book and came out pretty empty handed.  James Stokesbury (A Short History of WWI) tackles the job superbly if you want an introduction to WWI 
 Make sure this is the product you want.  The cost to return this was 20% of original price plus shipping 
 im not sure why i gave this a second star; maybe its because i feel guilty for always loathing everything john malkovich is associated with? directed and written by spike jonze and charlie kaufman (the same duo who gave us the equally pretentious "adaptation"), this one centers around an unsuccessful puppeteer (john cusack) who figures out how to enter into the body of actor john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time and manages to turn that talent into riches and fame but oh my he still isnt happy even tho he gets to hang out with cameron diaz 
 I have not finished this book yet but so far I think this woman is a nut. Referring to grocery store shelves as morgues for "dead" food. That's just stupid and weird. No cooked food? None? Forget it, lady. She has some good ideas but they are taken to the extreme 
 This is the worst book in a long time I've tried to read and get a story out of it.  Ms. Steele rambles on for chapter after chapter---and not much of anything happens!!!  It's just plain BORING!  About 1/3 through, the book went into the trash.  After reading Nora Roberts' books, this book is abominable.  It's back to Roberts for me 
 A book about bebop drummers needs to explain 1) what bebop drumming consists of and 2) how the styles of the various drummers profiled diverge. This book does not do either. Instead we are told that drummer after drummer after drummer has "a great feel" and "great time"; we learn nothing.  If it were just that I'd give the book another star for its sketchy and scattered biographical information, but considering how badly written the book is, I can't justify it.  I suggest instead that you buy a copy of "The Grove Dictionary of Jazz" and look up the entry for each famous drummer you want to know about. You'll learn a lot more and have a much better time doing it.  For transcriptions consult Modern Drummer magazine.   
 The first movie was an amazing film it had it all tension, horror etc. The second film was a slight let down. This film was a complete waste of time! It was rushed and parts of the story just simply did not make sense. For example the missing police man mentioned at the start of the film? The police woman who was killed by one of the Saw's machines? The whole thing just did not mesh together. It was obviously rushed and shows it. A real shame as this could have been a good film 
 Nancy Appleton has clearly declared her personal agenda against sugar, but her lack of objectivity, organization, credibility, or substance leave much to be desired in this book.  I was frustrated by the constant repetition throughout the text, and I found myself skipping paragraphs at a time to find any new information.  In addition, I was hoping to find concrete, applicable suggestions on HOW to kick the sugar habit.  While Dr. Appleton does attempt to include "food plans," they are simply lists of the good, the bad, and the ugly.  I do NOT recommend this book to others 
 I think the mobile is very cute, but there is no way it will fit onto my crib properly. I tried attaching it in several differnt places. I am going to return it. 
 In my experience (and I wish it were not so!), gays tend to share some unpleasant character traits, such as effeminacy or lack of masculinity, cliquishness, and lewdness.  The book's chief merit is that it doesn't deny their existence, but its chief defect is that it attempts, largely unsuccessfully, to try to interpret these characteristics in a more favorable light.  I agree that some of these favorable interpretations are reasonable: for example, I agree that the greater amoralism of gays opens up certain aesthetic or artistic possibilities, at least given a certain understanding of art.  But from the point of view that is most interesting to me, as someone trying to assess the romantic possibilities, I disagree that something very good can be built on such things 
 I really looked forward to this book after reading the review in The New Yorker.  The reviewer's critical skills, evidently, do not extend to evaluating the merits of a logical argument.   There are so many logical problems with the analysis in this book, it is difficult to know where to begin.    I will limit myself to just a handful, among countless possibilities.   1) The authors find a correlation between the stability of a basketball team's roster and its winning percentage, and conclude that roster stability is a factor in producing wins! Classic problem of mistaking effect for cause.  Clearly, winning teams are disinclined to make major roster changes, and losing teams are eager to.  I was so amazed at this I reread it to see if I missed where they pointed this out.  They didn't.   2) The authors show a correlation between more assists and winning percentage and conclude that assists help produce wins.  Again, very silly.  A team with a higher shooting percentage and fewer turnovers will of course get more wins and produce more assists.  But the assists are not producing the wins - the shooting percentage is.  Were these factors discounted?  Not according to the text.    3) Most problematic, the authors define a way of measuring the value of players to a team, and then "prove" their method by summing these values, per player, across each team, and show  that they do indeed predict the number of wins each team will get.  What they fail to realize is that their method of apportioning value to a player necessarily sums back to team totals such as points per possession that we know correlate to wins per team.  But this in no way proves that the apportioning is wrong.  We could just as easily base each player's value "team's points while players is on the floor - opposing team's points while player is in the floor".  Sum for all players on team, and you will find the team's points-per-game and the opposition's points per game, and you have just "proven" that your method of measuring a player's value is accurate.    4.  In looking at rebounds, there is not even the slightest caveat that a player's rebounds per game are affected by who he shares rebounding responsibilities with.  If you are in the front court with Shaq, you will get fewer rebounds, not because the other team gets them, but because your teammate does, so comparing rebounding stats between players across teams is highly questionable.    5. Ridiculously, they conclude that adding great players to your roster makes the other players worse not better (this is written as a great revelation, demythifying the common presumption that great players make teammates better).  Adding great players indeed will make other players statistically less productive.  They will take fewer shots, get fewer rebounds, fewer assists if a new ball-handler is added, etc.  And so, according their evaluation method, the other players become worse.  This should clearly tell them there is something wrong with their system, based so heavily on specific metrics of productivity.  Instead, they simply accept the merit of their method as fact, and conclude that adding great players really makes other players worse!!!  The most frustrating thing about this book, however, for an analytically minded reader, is its smugness.  They understand statistics. They have the answers.  They are bringing them down from the mountains and explaining them to us idiot peons.  All while their reasoning is so problematic.   I in no way am a supporter of the intuitive and nonsensical drivel one hears from so many sports coaches, players and commentators.  I would have enjoyed a good, statistical, analytical study of the game of basketball.  Unfortunately, this is not it.   
 According to the IMDB this movie is the first one specifically made for PC downloading...it shows.  Without any creative vision at all; horrible lighting, acting and editing and a confusing, muddled storyline, INCUBUS is everthing a bad horror movie should be.  Tedious.  Stupid.  And just not worth it, folks 
 I had 2 pieces of this item, - both had similar problems. First and major one is water and steam leakage between the filter holder and the machine. This, I believe, is due to poor Chinese assemblage. Secondly, "perfect froth" nipple has terrible persistent ordor of the material its made of, which perfectly transmits to your drink. Krups should've thought of changing this design and set better quality control over assemblage. The item was returned.  
 Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  They always show up as just a bunch of html code.  Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before.  He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods.  Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings.  Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!! 
 The included CR-ROM manual has a nifty "Setup Wizard" which sadly is not compatible with Macs, which I discovered only after buying this thing and then calling D-Link's Tech Support hotline. I talked to the guy for an hour trying to get the basic configuration behind me, only to have him tell me that I needed to call my ISP (surprise!) because it's their fault that it wouldn't configure properly. And I'm certain my ISP will tell me it's D-Link's problem. Not only that, but you also can't download firmware updates on for this router on a Mac.   I'm returning this and doing what I should have done in the first place - getting face-to-face advice from a good local electronics store. 
 A child wants to tell his father he loves him, and the father turns the exchange into a cruel game of one-upmanship.  The child tries and tries until he collapses, exhausted - and still the father won't accept the heartfelt message and chooses to outdo his tiny child and have the last word. That this book is popular and well received is disturbing to me.  The illustrations are very nice - and I'm hoping that this is the attraction people feel, since the message borders on psychological abuse 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 Not as good as the original but at least it is in color! This was not one of Daryl Hannah's finest moment. Some of the special effects were laughable especially the miniaturization of the city. Over all, the cast wasn't that good. However, if remakes of old classics are your bag this might be for you.  Now we wait for the Wasp Woman to be remade! 
 First, I confess: I'm an adult and I love playing with Legos.  Thus this ship was something of a disappointment.  As other reviewers noted, it's very unstable; the hull wants to keep collapsing as you build on it.  The dragon figurehead will fall off if you breathe on it.  Since the set SEEMS to be designed to be played with -- i.e., fire the catapult, move the sea serpent, etc. -- I would think a child would be very disappointed in this as a toy. You can't play with it or even touch it.  So it's reasonably fun to build but that's it -- it's definitely under par given Lego's usual attention to such details 
 I wanted to like this book.  I did. The problem, however, is that Ms. Hesser, has nothing to say. The best food writers write about food as a way to access a deeper understanding about the nature of humanity.  Witness Reichl's trilogy, in which you get an understanding of mental illness, the creation of oneself, the discovering of parents, and love, and a life's passion.  Hesser's writings provide me with a superficial link to her foodie world, nothing else.  Maybe she needs to suffer a bit before her next book, so that she can find some depth.  However, the recipes are excellent.  
 I like Evanovich novels for a light read and a few laughs, and usually her hero and heroine are downright combustible - the Stephanie Plum and Joe Morelli relationship, sustained through 12 books so far, being a case in point. But Full Scoop was actually a trial to get through. I could hear another voice in there which was distracting and interrupted Evanovich's comedic rhythm. The whole tone of the writing was down about five notches from what I have come to expect from Evanovich. The silly villains were either being too goofy or too violent, leaving us wondering were we supposed to be amused or frightened? The least forgivable of the sins committed in Full Scoop was the fact that there was absolutely no chemistry between Maggie and Zack. None at all. So it's hard to label the book: a sort of but not really romance, an almost but not much of a woman-in-danger.... maybe a new genre altogether - the slapstick thriller 
 A much condensed version would have helped but still would not have been a good story.  The end was a disappointment and the middle laborious 
 Once again, Carr's central truth is: To know how the addiction works is to be free of it.   Unfortunately this is simply a false dawn.  The greater the need for a solution, the more willingly we suspend disbelief and trust in a system that promises an end to our problem.  This is not to say the book contains nothing of worth. But Carr's demand for total deference and his insistence on offering a complete cure inevitably prepare us for eventual disappointment. We are all more intelligent than we are capable and awareness of the insanity of addiction never saved anyone from the disease. 
 While this book would be perfect for someone who owns a B&B, its just not practical for weekday mornings for a family of 2! It is very informative, if just a bit snobbish; With the exception of several pictures all together in the middle of the book, it is just black on white, with very small print. Also, unless you have at least a bit of experience, I can imagine it would be frustrating and time intensive.  Its probably not the thing for you if you like a "coffee-table" cookbook that allows you to salivate just by looking at the pictures, making it much more likely that you'll try them out 
 Failure to Launch was quite of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Matthew McConaughey, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Bates among others. A 35 year-old man's parents plot to have their son move out of the house (!) by hiring a professional who feigns interest in him... In short, the acting is generally pretty good (though nothing great), the setting is above average, while the dialogues and the plot are below average. The major setbacks are in relation to: 1) The weak plot and especially the weak dialogues, for which the writers are to blame.  Matthew McConaughey, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Bates were given weak lines.  What a waste of a good cast! 2) The whole "nephew" issue was just ridiculous! 3) The whole naked father thing... 4) Parents plotting to get rid of their child is absurd. On a positive note, Zooey Deschanel is delightful as Kit.  Let's see more of her... Though the potential for a decent movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers. In a nutshell, it's a mediocre movie and that's about it.  Wait till they show it on TV. 
 Usually my favorite book is the one I'm reading at the time.  However, Gardenias for Breakfast is my All Time Favorite Book EVER!!  I have given several copies for gifts and have shared my copy numerous times.  I think if you were a Mother of girls, you would especially relate to this book.  I do not have daughters, but, I am a daughter and I enjoyed it to the fullest.  Robin Jones Gunn is just a fantastic painter of word pictures and she shines in this book 
 The title of the book is great, and it's full of beautiful B&W pictures.  But the content is a nicely bound collection of ramblings.  It reminded me of the time I was in school and wanted to compose essays without much thinking or researching the subject - nice marketing campaign to publish those...  One of the examples - the author was inside of the Mc-Donald's with a group of students who were shouting and laughing, and then he left the building and its atmosphere and went into the Church, where he felt the atmosphere could not of been more different, making him look harder at trivial things...  And...  Either more architectural facts or more philosophical thinking would make this book interesting... 
 So I've got a bookstore, and it seems like everyone who ever attempts this book calls it tedious and gives up. So why is it that I see so many positive reviews here? Myself, I thought the authentic feel was a definite plus, (much of the time I did feel that I was reading an ancient memoir) but as for being "a page turner," as somebody else called it, you've got to be joking. This book is one of the slowest novels I've ever read. I did it on audio book and I kept falling asleep. It was a lot like sitting in Driver's Ed. after lunch and trying to keep my eyes from going out of focus. Creighton has written some pretty fun stuff, some of it even mildly thought provoking, but his is neither. Timeline and the two Jurassic Park books fit well into the whole "roller coaster of a book" thing, and personally I thought Sphere was great.  I realize that there isn't too much in the way of popular Viking fiction out there and so I suppose if you've got to have a Valhalla fix you could check this out, but I'd still recommend the Kirk Douglas movie "Vikings" over this book. Or maybe the book "Grendel" by John Gardener, which is based on the same epic poem. But this book just feels to much like a boring history lesson. 
 I firmly state that this touches the highest level of cinematic genius; right next to Too Wong Foo, Thanks for everything Julie Newmar... 
 The Big Book of A.A. defines Alcoholism as having an "insanity" component, with "strange mental blank spots", an "appalling lack of proportion to the consequences", and so forth. Unless you have this problem, you may be a "certain type of hard drinker", but you are *not* an alcoholic according to A.A. Trimpey seems unaware of the insanity component with real alcoholics. Will power isn't enough.  His book will probably be of little value if you are one the real alcoholics defined by the Big Book of A.A. Instead of Trimpey's book, I highly recommend the book Willpower's Not Enough by Arnold M. Washton 
 This essay may be worthwhile reading for someone getting started in the sport but it useless for the experienced sportsman. Little more than a superficial retred of what so many others have written. Save your money and buy something from the classic outdoor writers like Ruark, O'Conner, or Gene Hill. You could also try the nature writers like Teale, Carrighar, Thompson-Seton, Paul Brandreth, John Taintor Foote or many others 
 To charge a ridiculously high price for an abridged release of any TV series is a crime. In this case it only adds insult to injury. This TV show was never fully appreciated, much less promoted in it's original run, which coincided with the early years of The Simpsons. But that can be credited to Fox Television's still relatively early, unsure of itself years when it wasn't quite sure where to emphasize its marketing. Nevertheless, that's no reason to perpetuate that crime in its DVD release. Chris Elliott was perfectly cast in this role of the live at home with the folks, 30 year old paper boy. It gave him an avenue of extention for the dry wit he demostrated in his years on David Letterman (who can forget, the man under the stands, and his Marlon Brando routines on that show). Watching this show you can see where producers cast him as the lead in "Cabin Boy," again, another unappreciated work. The wit and sarcasm are the same, as is the way he irks those around him, including his own folks, which includes his real life dad Bob Elliott of classic old time radio fame, and Elanor Donahue of "Father Knows Best" and "Andy Griffith," where she played a before her time sexy pharmacist named Ellie. I give this series 2 stars merely due to the quality of the episodes themselves, which  was the perfect marriage of writers who worked around Elliotts' delivery and humor. On that it should get a 5, but the collection offered here is a disgrace. This show ranks as one of the top 2 TV shows to get cut short before given a fair chance, along with "Police Squad," which at least was given a second life in movie theaters via "The Naked Gun" movies. Elliott deserved better than just "Cabin Boy" towards that end. Try again on the DVD release boys. Either do it right, or it shouldn't have been done at all 
 First off let me state for the record that I only buy Sony , but I have to advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman. I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006, as I had purchased replacement insurance and was able to return it because it broke. It is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open, not to mention the headphones always pull out. The FM receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable. Save your self the hassel!!!!! 
 I have read other novels by Dorothea Frank, and I wasn't expecting too much- only interesting characters and a reasonably interesting plot.  The book was horrible.  While it did have the usual low country setting, the plot was awful.  The book was written in first person with the narrator being Grace, a travel agent who could not even ask her Italian-Catholic parents to include her boyfriend in their family gatherings. Her spineless mother, who couldn't stand up to her husband, and who was a slave to her own mother, supposedly had some deep secret reason for her doormat behavior, however that aspect was not even explored. Most annoying to me was the Catholic miracle aspect.  Perhaps Frank ought to reconsider writing novels and write sales material for holy water and religious statues 
 Podhoretz's attempt to portray the Bush administration in sunny optimistic terms is partly a desperate bid to recapture the fabled halcyon glow of the Reagan years. It falls flat, because let's face it, the Bush administration is pretty darn nihilistic. It takes extreme mental hopscotch to try and feel that same optimism that Podhoretz apparently does. To give the devil his due, Podhoretz does acknowledge that 53 million American voters-- the majority as it were--beg to differ.  Podhoretz is all sport in his mythmaking. Prince Hal was born in Connecticut, but perceiving the hostility to the North in his new-found land of Texas, he quickly adopts the walk and the talk. Hal cut his teeth in politics, as a member of the "Scrub Team." He was responsible for enforcing loyalty to poppy's administration. Although Bush worked hard to establish his own identity, he doesn't like "psychobabble," i.e. self-reflection. The son was liberated by his father's defeat. No more moderation. As liaison to the Christian Conservatives, Bush forged bonds, assuring the righteous ones that one day he'd "reciprocate by hewing to their views on social issues like abortion."  For the most part, Podhoretz avoids the Anne Coulter School of partisanship. He's more insidious. He likes to plant seeds of slander here and there, sometimes in the midst of some seemingly innocuous statements, e.g. "The view from Paris is, as has been the case so often, echoed by Leftists in the United States." By inference, dissenters are all leftists, whose ideas contain the germ of foreign thinking, rather than the old-fashioned, corn-pone, home-spun, heimat homilies of the righteous right (when in need of a good propaganda thrust, always resort to xenophobia & commie-baiting.) His take on Joseph Wilson is nothing but a glib rendering of factoids, and doesn't bother to address any of the relevant facts. Such as: Wilson's expertise, the extent of his contacts and the fact that there were only a few mines in Africa capable of producing uranium in any quantity--one was owned by a Euro consortium, the other was flooded.  Since I am used to this partisan polemic, there are only a few things that really raised the hairs on the back of my neck. Here's one example: Podhoretz likens the criticism of Wolfowitz and other Jewish Neocons to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. By even invoking Protocols in this taunting careless bad faith manner, Podhoretz comes perilously close to blood libel himself. It also betrays the uneasy relationship between Jewish Neocons and Christian Fundamentalists within the Bush administration. Wolfowitz and Kissinger are as representative of the Jewish people, as Clarence Thomas is to all black people, as Ann Coulter is to the state of Connecticut, and as O'Reilly is to all persons of Irish heritage from Long Island. Wolfowitz and Coulter are fringe elements, so radical and nihilistic, they defy any sane person's understanding. They betray any traditional, sound upbringing. But that's probably pretty hard to understand if you don't talk to at least 53 million Americans who don't share the same ideology, (unless you have to, Ann Coulter. 
 This is a boring album and one song Renegade Master was possibly put on there in order to persuade people to buy the album to make them think that all the tracks were good, I was suckered into it. This was a great marketing ploy, kudos to the people who did that! Otherwise this album is not worth the plastic it is printed on.  I wish I left my wallet in El Segundo, then I would not have had the money to waste on this 
 If you decide to purchase this book then please pay careful attention to Dan Corner's tactics and deception.  Dan refutations of eternal security proof texts such as Eph.4:30 and others are often not answered directly.  Instead of answering many eternal security proof text directly he instead will funnel our proof texts thru 1st Cor.6:9-11 as somehow proving that Paul must not have believed in eternal security. What Dan does is that he views 1st Corinthians 6:9-11 as proof that Paul didn't believe in eternal security and then will read 1st Cor.6:9-11 and his belief into any other passage that teaches eternal security such as Eph.4:30. If you look at the Scripture Index of his book then notice how often he refers to HIS proof texts and that is because he reads them into all of the eternal security proof texts that he has no direct argument for. He refers 58 times to 1st Corinthians 6:9-11 and 55 times (total pages) to Galatians 5:19-21 throughout his book when trying to refute eternal security. Please note how much he refers to his other proof texts in his index such as the 75 times that he refers to Rev.21:8 throughout his book. He tries to throw so much of his proof texts into our proof texts so as to hopefully drown out the plain teaching such as found in Eph.4:30. Does that sound scholarly to you?  Read a publication by Jehovah Witnesses on the trinity for they do the same thing. Dan's tactics would be like me refering 60 times to Eph.4:30, 58 times Romans 5:9,10 and 54 times referring to Eph.1:13,14 and then reading them into all of Dan Corner's proof texts. Will I get 5 stars for that kind of stragedy? Dan only proves that he doesn't have an answer but has to argue like a Jehovah Witness that comes knocking at your door. Have you ever debated a Jehovah Witness where you had quoted a clear verse of Scripture that states that Jesus is God only to have the Jehovah Witness not directly answer that verse but will run to a verse elsewhere that seems to appear contradictory to the verse that you just quoted?  THAT'S DAN CORNER FOR YOU!! If you compare eternal security books with books on conditionalism then you will find that eternal security actually tackles the problem texts head on while conditionalism does not but will read verses from other books of the Bible into that one verse in order to make you think that the author really didn't mean what it clearly seems to say in the verse.  Example: Eph.4:30 said those "having believed" are sealed unto the day of redemption guaranteed an inheritance.  Conditionalists realizing the clear wording will say "Well Paul in 1st Cor.6:9-11 said this...so obviously Paul didn't believe in eternal security" and that is how Dan deals with many eternal security proof texts. Dan also is great when it comes to arguing his logic and forces them into Scripture.  He accuses those that believe in eternal security for arguing from logic when over half his book is him doing it himself.   Dan's logic tells him that Judas had to be a saved man because Judas was a disciple.  OH REALLY? Dan Corner didn't think this one through and neither do his follower's.  Let's see how Dan didn't think through that:  1st, Jesus Himself said "Have I not chose you twelve and one of you is (present tense) a devil?"  How can a man be saved and a devil at the same time? Keep in mind that Jesus made that statement one year prior to His crucifixion. Second, Judas was described as a thief while still as a disciple but according to Dan, no thief is a saved man and the single act of thievery will cause you to lose your salvation.  In fact, there is not one thing good ever said about Judas. Dan Corner tried to describe Judas as one that gradually became evil.  I don't know how you become a gradually present tense "devil" a year before Jesus was betrayed by him.  In the Greek, the indefinite article "a" is absent before "devil."  That makes the comment by Jesus concerning Judas even more direct, Judas wasn't "a devil" but "devil" and certainly not one that was gradually becoming evil.  Thanks Dan because according to your thinking then we must have a saved present tense devil that was a thief still allowed to be a disciple.  This is Dan arguing logic here with no substance. Dan's view of the prodigal son is very amusing as well.  Here is a parable that pictures the love of God as well as a rebuke to the Pharisees that stood there complaining that Jesus receives sinner's. Now when dealing with Dan Corner disciples, I will ask them if the Pharisees were saved people in that chapter?  To my amazement, all of them say, "Of course not."  Do they not realize that the hateful son in that parable of the prodigal son was the Pharisees standing there?  Yes, many Dan Corner disciples know that but never thought about it. What they didn't think about is that the Pharisee is also called a "son" in that parable and therefore if I can use Dan's logic then they must be saved too, but we know that was not true at all. If you claim that the one son was saved then so is the other since he too is with the Father. Now if this parable is teaching that one is saved and then lost and then saved again then we have some problems in that passage.  1st, both sons are always referred to as "sons" ALWAYS and never became anything other than a son.  2nd, if you noticed, the the son that supposedly lost his salvation got it better the second time around. He got a ring and a robe and new sandals and God kissed Him and prepared a fatted calf for his return.  Wow! I say that we all lose our salvation so that God can do a better job saving us the second time around!!  Dan as he does every where else will read more into a passage than what is actually given there.  Sorry Dan, but this is not a picture of how God saves a man twice but to expose the hearts of the Pharisees who professed to be righteous and strict law abiders.  It showed the Pharisees how they were hateful and against God's love, mercy and grace.  This passage is dealing with Jewish people who were in a covenant relation with God, which made THEM ALL children of the covenant and children of God (covenant children and not children of grace), this was not the case with us Gentiles then.  The Pharisee in this passage which we know were unsaved and that Jesus called them "vipers" and full of "dead man bones" were called "SONS." The Pharisees are being described as sons too (by covenant and not by grace).  So we know that the Pharisees were not pictured as saved men but were being used as an example in Luke 15 to expose their hearts true condition.  If this is a picture of salvation then God has children that hate other believers.  Dan Corner will love to tell you that if you hate your brother then you abide in death (you lost your salvation) but then why doesn't Dan apply it here to the the hateful son, WHY DAN?  Because to admit that this pictures both the Pharisees and the Prodigal son as SONS by grace and not covenant would then put him in a position to deny what he believes elsewhere in Scripture and that Dan can never honestly do.  Sorry Dan, but this is God's covenant relation to Israel and that is why both Pharisee and the wayward child are both called sons (by covenant).  If you want to describe the one son as losing his salvation then I can say that the Pharisees who were being described in that passage as a son were saved men who obviously hated the grace of God in saving sinners. I hope now that you actually see the problem of reading a salvation message and making it "Saved, Lost and saved again" passage?? Somehow Dan Corner sees this hateful Pharisee which is opposed to God's love and mercy in this parable as a saved man.   Here is Dan at his best, you will find him quoting from the NIV, NKJV, KJV on just one page alone.  Now why does Dan do that? If Dan can find another version that can argue what he believes a little more convincingly then he will USE IT! Do you know that Jehovah Witnesses do the same thing concerning the trinity in their publication 'Should I believe the Trinity?'  Dan warns against using versions that seem to render a verse in favor of eternal security but doesn't tell you that he Bible hops in order to find a version that seems to support him.  He will quote the NIV in most places but certainly will not use it when it comes to Romans 8:1 and I hope you know why?? It is because most versions know that the King James Translator's added a phrase to "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus" in hopes of preventing careless living by borrowing words from verse 4.  Most manuscripts do not contain anything after "no condemnation" in verse one.  But good old Dan will certainly not quote the NIV, NASV along with many other versions because the verse refutes him!  Dan at his website gave GREAT arguments against those that hold to the King James Only position.  Dan went into great detail how "827 words and phrases" found in the KJV do not even exist in our today's English. He even posted an article called, 'Understandest What Thou Readest?' Dan in one of his articles said these words concerning the KJV onlyist that they are promoting "a very hard, if not sometimes IMPOSSIBLE, translation to understand." Dan points that it was the Catholic Priest Erasmus that was responsible for the Textus Receptus (used by KJV). Dan ended his one article with his recommendations for what version that one should use and his recommendations are: "NIV, NASV and NRSV" but NOT the KJV.  Guess what? None of Dan's recommended versions has the added clause that the KJV translator's threw into Romans 8:1. Dan also claims that most people that use the KJV believe in eternal security but that made no sense to me since if Erasmus was behind the KJV Textus Receptus. Certainly Erasmus and his Catholic beliefs of losing your salvation should be everywhere found in the KJV and guess what? You don't find such teaching in any version!!! Dan did a great job on the King James Version even showing many translation errors of the KJV and shows that you should use any of his recommended versions OTHER than the KJV.  Now I am not a King James onlyist and I agree with nearly all of Dan's arguments against KJV onlyists, but left reading his arguments confused. Ask yourself this, Why would Dan argue the KJV after his many arguments against using it at his website articles?  You guessed it, if the KJV can argue something that seems help him in his argument then he most certainly will use it. Can you not see his deceit here?  Anyone can find out that the KJV translator's added a phrase to verse one but Dan will not tell you that because the KJV appears to be his friend in that verse while all his other recommended Bibles refute him on Romans 8:1. Compare Romans 8:1 in the KJV to his recommended versions and you too will see for yourself why Dan chose to use the KJV which he elsewhere preaches against. Just remember, to Dan it is not okay for you to use another version that supports eternal security. Why can't I follow his same honesty as he does with the KJV by quoting 1st Cor.15:2 from the New Living Translation? The New Living Translation reads it as: "And it is this Good News that saves you if you firmly believe it-unless, of course, you believed something that was never true in the first place."  As you can see, 1st Corinthians 15:2 now argues very strongly for those that believe in eternal security doesn't it?  Actually that translation accurately teaches what the whole passage is actually talking about.  Paul more than once in that chapter used the word "if" but NOT the way Dan would like you to believe.  Read the entire chapter for yourself and read where Paul said "IF there be no resurrection..." "IF Christ be not raised..." and ask whether Paul was arguing "if" as a condition where maybe Christ was not risen or maybe Christ had not died.  The passage is dealing with those denying the resurrection and if that be the case then their FAITH IS VAIN just like in verse 2.  The passage everywhere argues like verse 2 that if you are not believing something that is not true that Paul preached to you then your faith is VAIN. Paul more than once in that chapter used the words "then your faith is vain." The NLT seemed to understand that along with most scholars but Dan simply focused on just one word "if" and chose to ignore the context and Paul's usage elsewhere in that passage of the words "if" and "vain." Dan also loves Young's literal translation because the word "believe" is the "present tense" as meaning to Dan that one has to "continually believe" in order to be saved. Now why doesn't Dan quote Young's Literal Translation on many words that have believing with the result of HAVING eternal life and HAVING believed in the past tense?  Dan can't nor does offer any explanation to Acts 16:31 where the word "believe" is in the aorist tense, imperative mood.  He also doesn't point out John 6:69 ("believe")and 11:27 where the perfect tense is used.  The tense is defined as "an action which is viewed as having been completed in the past once for all."  Jesus cry from the cross "it is finished" is an example of a perfect tense, unless Dan says that "finished" must continue on but who knows what Dan thinks anyways??  By the way, I'm typing and that is in the present tense so does that mean that I cease not to type??  I love Dan's arguments concerning John 10:28,29! Dan says that the only person that has eternal life is the one that "follows" Jesus and that those that believe in eternal security are ignoring the context of verse 27.  NO NO NO, I don't think so Dan!  It is you Dan that is ignoring the context because it goes back to verse 24. "Follow" is the same as believing but Dan makes a distinction between "continual believe" of John 3:16 and "continual follow" of John 10:27. Wow Dan! Continual faith 100% of the time with continual obedience 100% of the time. Dan corner believes another gospel and should be feared. From Scripture, Dan Corner cannot be a saved man because he contradicts Paul. Dan Corner and his followers right now have before them conditional security and it is based on whether or not they will believe the free grace gospel offered to them in Scripture.  The Security is conditional upon their believing it, but if they persist in rejecting it then Scripture clearly teaches that their chance for eternal security is over at death.  Dan gave me a great book title "The Unbeliever's Conditional Security" where eternal security or eternal damnation are laid before your very eyes in Scripture.  Knowing that "follow" means to believe in that passage, does it appear conditional when Jesus said, "I give unto (now) them ETERNAL LIFE?"  Wow Dan, you can have eternal life for three days!  Sorry Dan, but my God offers salvation and not probation as your god does.  Look further at that verse, does it sound conditional when Jesus says: "...and THEY SHALL NEVER NEVER NEVER PERISH...NEITHER SHALL ANY MAN PLUCK THEM OUT OF MY HAND...NO MAN SHALL IS ABLE TO PLUCK THEM OUT OF MY FATHER'S HAND."  Conditonal? Yeah right, I guess "no man is able" only applies to your neighbor and not yourself according to Dan.  Sorry Dan but it is all inclusive. You have taken a security verse for a believer and made a mockery of God who promises eternal life and shall never perish into "you might never perish if you continually follow me." Thanks Dan, damn yourself with your heresy and not others please! Dan foolishly argues that Romans 8:35-39 does not include "sin" when it says that "NOTHING shall separate us from the love of God...."  Oh Dan, verse one states that there will be "NO CONDEMNATION" which means that there can be no charge brought against us, for our sins were thoroughly dealt with in Christ. The chapter beings with NO CONDEMNATION and ends with NO SEPARATION but you chose to play the fool. Don't you see that Dan is reading his words into passages of Scripture? Dan Corner shows his ultimate desperation when trying to refute Eph.1:13,14; 4:30 that deals with the believer being sealed unto the day of redemption. He only makes one comment on page 698 for Eph.1:13,14 and argues exactly how I told you he does at the beginning of my comments at the very top. He doesn't answer the verse but instead reads his prodigal son opinions into it and then Revelation 21:8.  He makes comments on Ephesians 4:30 on pages 117,446,459,473,541 but never deals with the verse directly. His only attempt at refuting it was to associate a spiritual seal that the Holy Spirit does to a physical seal that man does in Matthew 27:57,60. I hope that you can see the problem with that right away??? Dan was trying to show that the seal over Jesus tomb was removed and therefore a spiritual seal can be removed too. Why? Why? Why? Does our ignorant Conditionalist heretic choose to add conditional statements to a verse as though his god forgot to write in there so Dan feels obligated to do it for Him?  There is no Scripture that says man can remove a seal that God has set. Can man remove the seal of Revelation 20:3 or any other seal of God? Dan will say yes by sinning so therefore man can remove his own seal that God did Himself. Do you see how foolish it is to believe what Dan is teaching? He will take verses from everywhere else other than the verse itself in order to change its meaning. The verse says, "Sealed unto the day of redemption" but Dan will make that as "sealed unto the day of redemption maybe." Have you ever read a Conditionalists gospel tract?  Ask yourself if it sounds anything like the gospel presentation of Acts 16:31 or 1st Corinthians 15:3,4??? No it is not even close, they have thrown so many warnings and conditions into it that nobody will be saved by their gospel.  One thing that a Conditionalist will never be accused of even though they everywhere accuse me as they did the apostle Paul: "Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?"  The reason that nobody can ever make that mistake with Conditionalists is because they are so works oriented and nobody can walk away in their congregation saying "Wow! What a God of grace!!!" If you would like to have the loss of assurance of salvation, if you would like to be unhappy, if you like to be confused, if you like live uncertain of the present and future, if you would like to experience the love of God that is no better than that of abusive parents, if you want a twisted view of Scripture, if you want to join hands with the universal religion of losing your salvation belief, if you want a faith that constantly wavers, if you want a works oriented gospel that will damn a soul then please buy this book!  I think that you will not be disappointed by Dan's book! Take it from me who was once a former Conditionalist who struggled with doubt, confusion and a works oriented wesleyan gospel. Praise God for saving me from that!! Please take the time to read where I dive more into Dan Corner's book and his arguments under "Eternal Security" by Dr Charles Stanley. If you are struggling with assurance of salvation and would like some help then please email me. If you are a sincere seeker wanting to know if Salvation can or cannot be lost and need help with some problem verses or arguments then please email me. If you are only seeking to argue then don't bother for I delete such emails. Thank you p.s. I just like to say thank you for those that have emailed me. Some have only attempted to argue for Dan but others of you that have been Conditionalists for a long time have challenged your own position and one of you has recently rejected Dan's erroneous teaching and has trusted Christ after many years of believing that heresy of Conditionalism!!! That has been encouraging to me!  Thank you 
 I was disappointed in several aspects of this DVD. First of all, if you are an avid Martha-on-TV watcher, you have probably seen most of these segments. Secondly, the cake on the case front is not shown or demonstrated on the DVD. Thirdly, the wedding gown segments are virtually repeats of one another--showing the typical silhouettes of wedding gowns and recommendations of figure types for each. 
 Already wary of John Vornholt's writing, I was hoping this would change my mind...I was wrong. There is little or no action until the very end, and I was hoping it would be epic space battles, which I got from the cover.    But the Enterprise is stuck in a starbase, and all the crew does is try to  help some pathetic commander. And when they do finally show up, it's too  obvious, and it was like an after-thought to add the rest of the crew in  the story.   The only two characters who really shined were Hasmek and  Geordi, since they weren't used that much, and Vornholt couldn't screw them  up.   The whole Badlands part is pointless.    I suggest to anybody that  you read the Deep Space Nine series, because they're awesome in comparison.    A war fits nicely into the Deep Space Nine universe, not The Next  Generation universe 
 This blows. Vocals blow. Guitars blow. It just blows. Deal with it! 
 First off, I am an avid reader and love a long challenging read, however, this novel is one of the worst I have ever read! It is long, boring and has absolutely no plot. I purchased it when it first came out without reading any reviews. Although from the looks of most of them here, I personally suspect that many of those who raved, never actually read the book 
 So very boring. I had to struggle to finish this thing and then wished I hadn't 
 It took me a couple months to get through this book.  Although there are many interesting clips [from the author's magazine interviews over the years], the book does not hang together.  It appears that the author attempted to weave the stories together into some kind of themes, by decade: but there is really no "greater insight" provided.  I would have preferred to read an anthology of more in-depth commentaries on a few female artists.  I also found Ms. Hirshey's ornate writing style to be difficult reading 
 Anyone with the smallest bit of sense knows that *true* Christians never get sick.  If this gentleman was ever really sick, then he simply did not read his bible enough or he had a lack of faith.  Furthermore, if you just read Dr. Don Colbert's book about what Jesus ate and cooked (even while on the cross), then this should never pose a problem. But, there's always the possibility that, even if you do have a lack of faith, or are not a real Christian, just make sure that before you finally kick the bucket, you pray to God to heal you, say you're sorry and promise to go to church, say you belive in Him, change your wicked ways, and soon you'll be dancing in the sunshine.  That always works 
 There are WAY too many credible stories about these things causing problems to risk a $400 360. Putting *any* kind of power-drawing device between a piece of sophisticated electronics and its power supply is just asking for trouble -- I own a lot of expensive electronics and I'd never do it in a million years.  Instead of taking such a chance, go to your local retailer and buy a little fan (4"-6") designed for placing/clipping (depending on how you've got your Xbox set up) on your desk at work, etc. You can get one for $5-$10 and don't have to worry about leeching power from your 360. Just set it up beside the 360 so that air flows beneath and over top.  Since your average superstore has about a dozen fans that would fit the bill, you can shop for one that's quiet and fits your setup. My 360 actually runs quite cool, although I do have a small fan behind my audio rack that blows on my stereo amplifier.  ps Always, always, always put electronics that generate heat in as open a location as possible. NEVER put anything on top, ALWAYS place on a hard surface, and ALWAYS leave at least a few inches clearance all around. Lastly, ALWAYS use a surge suppressor 
 On the cover of this fine book is a blurb from the NY Times saying "If you have only enough money for one DTP book, buy this one," paraphrased, of course. The emphasis should be if you only have ONE. If you have any of Robin Williams' books or a Classroom in a Book, Parker's book will only be a re-hash of that. So, if you don't have a good DTP book, this is the book for you. If you have anyother reasonably good DTP book, this will just be the same stuff

 Generally I like Deaver's novels - and the premise of this one sounded interesting. But he's in over his head this time. Anyone who has spent more than a few hours online can see that the writer doesn't really understand what he's talking about. By the end of the book I was just reading it to finish it - and the end wasn't worth doing that.  If you have to read a Deaver novel, do yourself a favor and go re-read "The Coffin Dancer" instead

 Bought it on a Friday night. Spent 3 hours Saturday and 3 hours on Sunday trying to get everything to work. It took 3 tech people and an hour on hold for them to confirm that there were no upgrades to the software to support M4A files. Not that it's just grabbing files from itunes, but when I just rip a regular CD, it also stores as an M4A file. So, my music was useless on the machine.  So, now I'm just left with viewing my photos. That's ok. I can deal with that. However, the help for getting a connection to your wireless networks (both the on line help and on the phone help, mind you) was useless. After 6 hours of getting "No server found", I packed it in and returned the item 
 Generally, i find John Ringo's plots to be much better than his execution (with the signal exception of the "fantasy" series that includes "The Emerald Sea", and even there, i detect a trend toward what Tom Easton ([i think] referred to a "conanism".) -- the "March" series, in collaboration with my brother, David Weber, may be an exception, since i'm not sure who did what in their production.  (Which said, they are really rather better books than either of them alone has produced lately.)  I don't know which of the co-authors did the main plotting, or who did what in the writing, but i got halfway and then hit a brick wall, when it changed (in somewhat exaggerated terms) from "Sgt Rock and the Combat Happy Joes of Easy Company Behind Enemy Lines"  to "Indiana Jones meets the Predator"...  I think my sense of neatness and econmoy in plotting was somewhat tweaked by the introduction of so much plot mechanics built of at least well-coloured cardboard which all, apparently, had to be wiped out halfway through in order to let the real story begin.  When they pulled a similar stunt in the movie "Executive Decision", it was done early enough and plausibly enough that i admired their audacity; in "The Hero" i felt it came too late in the story to work right and felt as if it were forced by plot considerations, rather than growing naturally from the plot. (Rather as the "dirt-in-the-window" sequence in "Close Encounters" is really only there to write out the wife and kids, beause Spielberg couldn't be bothered to come up with anything more logical...)  I was enjoying it reasonably well up to the point when the antique gun* wasn't fired, but was instead pulled down off the mantelpiece and broken over the authors' knee...  *From playwright Anton Chekhov's saying that if a gun is shown mounted on the wall in Act I, someone better have taken it down and used it by Act III 
 This is a book about our society and yet I am left wondering how "everything bad for us" actually affects our society. I believe the author's underlying presumption is that improving the individual improves our society as a whole. This societal analysis, however, is completely missing.  The book can be summed up as follows: 1. Games and software are more complex, therefore our problem-solving ability has increased. 2. TV is more complex, therefore our emotional intelligence has increased. 3. The Internet gives us new ways to connect with others, therefore our communication abilities have increased.  The litmus test for all this is increasing IQ scores.  Part I of the book goes to great lengths to explain how an individual's "mental muscle" is increased through popular media: games, TV, software, and the Internet. Part II asserts that increased IQ scores are the proof that our mental muscle is increasing.  The individual may be benefiting from popular media, but is our society benefiting? Are more technological breakthroughs happening? Are we better able to piece together disparate facts provided by the media and government into a cohesive whole? Is software easier to use so we can more easily accomplish our goals? Are communities and homes being designed better so they improve communication between neighbors and families? Can we better recognize the underlying motives of our politicians? Are we making great strides to decrease global warming, air and water pollution, forest depletion, species extinction, famine, homelessness, cancer and disease, gender and racial inequality, and the distribution of wealth?  If our ability to see connections and solve problems has improved, why do a vast number of Americans still believe there is a connection between 911 and Iraq? Why do we not recognize that the diversity of plant and animal species on the planet directly affects our well-being? Why do we seem incapable of understanding that many of the divisive issues we focus upon (e.g., school prayer, flag burning, abortion, gay marriage) are simply manifestations of larger societal problems (e.g., inequality, poverty, domination and control).  How is the popular media affecting these societal and technological issues? Is it making them worse? This is the missing part of the book that I hope will be addressed in another edition 
 I was able to go cover to cover in about 5 minutes.  If you manage people that use their brains to do their work and you have no idea how to understand, manage and motivate them then this book might help you out a bit.  I found it to be off-topic for me as I was hoping that it was going to be written for the people who Think for a Living rather than their managers. 
 Horrible editing that SHOULD embarrass the company.  Watch out for the typos and some logic errors, but there isn't much else out there to help you so ... this book is probably your only choice.  Don't buy it, just use the copy from your local library or the copy at Barnes & Nobles / Walden's so you don't have to waste your money on it.  Good luck 
 This is not a history of Ancient Persia but rather a set of essays on just a few topics: "The Testimonies" (i.e. the historical sources); "The King and his Subjects"; and "Everyday Life". Basically, apart from the Bisutun relief (text available at http://www.avesta.org/op.htm) and the Persepolis Texts (R. T. Hallock, Chicago 1969), nearly all the sources are Greek or Latin upon which the author relies despite the contrary assertion given by the publisher on the flyleaf.  It's not the ancient Greek and Roman writers that the author attempts to discredit but rather the modern writers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Better to read "The Persian Empire" by J. M. Cook or "A Political History of the Achaemenid Empire" by Muhammad A. Dandamaev

 I have to agree with other reviewers who call this the weakest link in the trilogy. Its tone is very different from "Out of the Silent Planet" and "Perelandra". Those stories were magical, this one was... bewildering. I think the key is that the other two books were timeless, and still work today; but this one is too focused on a time and place (British society and universities in the 1940s) for most of today's readers to be able to connect to. If you want to finish the trilogy, this is worth reading once; but be prepared for something totally different from the first two books 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 Another tired story about the Blackman as the horrible villian and the Blackwoman as the innocent victim...And we wonder why our community has so many problems..Maybe it's because of attitudes that are based on fantasy like this film and some other films..."Color Purple" , "For Colored Girls...." etc. We need to stop the finger pointing a realize that liberation can only occur if we "work together"...That means Blackmen and Blackwomen.. 
 I like Metallica first of all. But this was their worst release along with Kill Em All. All the songs on this album are really horrendous. Metallica only made about a few good albums, want to get one???? Get Master of Puppets, Black, and Ride The Lightning. They all have about 3-7 good songs. This album is a waste!!!! Get those albums insted 
 I got a copy of this book a few years back as a Christmas gift, and the title and cover immediately put me off (and I'm really not the type that judges a book by it's cover).  It wasn't until recently that I started reading this novel.  Big mistake on my part.  The novel began well enough, but then began a downward spiral.  It had one of the oddest plots I've ever seen, and that alone normally wouldn't put me off a book.  But in addition to the bizarre story line, it seemed as if Koontz had wrote the book, and then went back and looked up every word he had written in the thesaurus and replaced it with a synonym.  Simple sentences were unneccesarily drawn out, and some of his figurative language (especially that which involved Middle Eastern conflict) was flat and boring.  Truly one of the worst reads I've ever had the displeasure of enduring 
 If you own this book The Barbecue America Cookbook: America's Best Recipes from Coast to Coast  then don't buy Barbecue America: A Pilgrimage in Search of America's Best Barbecue because they both are the same book word for word pic for pic

 THe reviews I read had people saying, "OMG i have no idea what is goign to happen.........blah blah blah." [...]. Everyone knows what is going to happen. Mia and Lilly will become best friends again because they have been through out all the books. I don't think Meg will change that.They will probally become friends again in the next book. As for Mia and Micheal, they will get back together. Meg did not write so many books with them being in love for nothing. Meg even wrote how miserbale they were when they broke up. Tehy will make up when Mia is a senoir.I mean how obvious can it be. I thought this was an awful book 
 ONCE A BOOK BECOMES A BESTSELLER, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO FIND NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THAT BOOK. THIS BOOK MAYBE A BESTSELLER BUT I DON'T THINK A NON-PHYSICIST WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE AUTHOR. UNLESS ONE IS PREPARED TO EXERT ONESELF MENTALLY TO A GREAT EXTENT, ONE SHOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO READ THIS BOOK. ONE OF MY FRIENDS, WHO IS A PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RECOMMENDED IT TO ME. I AM A PHARMACIST AND EVENTHOUGH I LEARNT A FEW SURPRISING THINGS FROM THIS BOOK HERE AND THERE, I WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND UNTIMATELY HAD TO LEAVE IT ONLY HALF-READ. 
 I suppose for me personally this sounded like the many sessions I attended, the same old same old. For anyone who has ever thought of being an entrepreneur, don't read this book, you may be discouraged. To those who are, you don't need this. There is nothing in here you don't already know. Experience is the best teacher, and most times I agree books can help, this one was a disappointment. I could of downloading most of this info from the web.When you can't do, you try to teach...This is what these authors are trying to have us believe...mmmmmm don't think so.  
 When my husband and I first got our waffle maker, we couldn't believe how well it worked - at this price point, nothing could be better.  A couple of months ago the lock that holds the waffle plate upright while you're pouring batter and removing the waffle broke in the middle of using the waffle maker.  It slipped to the side and burnt the inside of my arm.  Three months later, I still have a scar and I can no longer in any way recommend this waffle maker.  I'm going to purchase something slightly more expensive (e.g., KitchenAid) that hopefully has more of a focus on ensuring that parts continue to work.  If you do choose to buy this, BE CAREFUL 
 I was very disappointed in the content of Dr. Rosenfelds book on alternative health.  It is clear to me that the millions of Chiropractic patients are more educated about Chiropractic than Dr. Rosenfeld himself.   With 66,000 licensed Chiropractors in the United States alone, the terms "alternative" have an ever-changing meaning.  I would not recommend this book to anyone searching for non-biased information on Chiropractic, or other "alternatives" 
 all this book has done is denounce women and witches. the writer should review how her "subjects" really are before she strikes them down! VERY DISTATSEFU 
 I was excited when I heard about this.  Sorry, I can't handle it.  Bare, buddy, you should stay in retirement if this is going to be the result of your new efforts 
 I ran across this book at the library and remembered that I had read it as a child. I didn't remember absolutely loving it, nor did I remember hating it. After re-reading it last night, I now know why I had no strong feelings attached to it.  The book is mildly entertaining, but the characters are flat and -- with a few exceptions -- the action is relatively predictable. Written for boys (although not inaccessible to girls), the book's only female characters are all adults. Our Hero, Kerby, is a Boy's Boy of 1960. He makes messes, resists doing his chores and stays out playing too late, but he isn't really a bad boy, and in fact, his parents worry about him when he behaves like a perfect angel. Naturally, Kerby has a faithful dog, who like him, gets into trouble but isn't really truly bad. Bumps Burton is the typical Misunderstood Bully, with standard bully name. Fenton Claypool is the Good Boy who is not so good as to be (in the author's words) "prissy"; Fenton's goodness allows the author to add one of the few truly surprising plot twists to the book. The adults also fit neat stereotypes, such as The Nosy Neighbor Lady and the Frazzled but Hyper-Organized Pagent Director.  The basic plot is: Kerby does a good deed for an Eccentric Old Lady in Distress. The old lady gives Kerby a magic chemistry set. Strange things begin to happen. Is the set really magic? Who is the old lady? And how will Kerby avoid getting his nose twisted by Bumps?  A light and somewhat entertaining read, this book is worth checking out of the library... but not adding to your own library at home 
 Bigoted and racist title for a book about talented blacks, their deserving of a more honorable title since they were called these racist nicknames all their lives and had to be these stereotypes to show their talent, but he can get away with naming a book as he has this one because he's Black, I'm sure if a white did the same, the NAACP will jump on him. Bogle suppose to lift Blacks up not put them down.  Here's a long but informative review! Naturally since Bogle is the only one writing about early Black film stars people believe everything he says. He plays it safe by always talking about the same ole' stars that he talked about in his last books. Never does he introduce the public to unsung talents we never heard of. He spends most of the time talking about how mulatto, how light or how dark such and such is and how such and such couldn't do this or that because of this or that. When whites write on their stars they don't write about how blonde, how brunette or how red head someone was and how Irish or Italian one looked. Which proves how stuck on skin color Blacks really are! Why do Blacks feel they always have to spend time talking about race instead of giving these stars their recognition and due, forgetting how they look and telling of their life and versatile careers, who they really were, where they come from, making one reading feel like they knew the person all their lives, make one feel the happiness and sadness. Bogle spends more time on what they didn't do then what they did do. Which is sad, the public is missing out on a lot. So again, do for yourself the research and don't' depend on others all the time.  Bogle loves talking about how white Fredi Washington looked instead of writing about her extensive, incredible career, she done more in her life then most of us could dream about it, she didn't let others prejudices hold her back. She was no tragic mulatto, another stupid name, minus well call Stepin Fetchit a tragic ni**er which he wasn't, he was the first black millionaire and no more of a stereotype then Black pimps, gangsters of today who are getting rich off of it like Step got rich off of his stereotype. Fredi will be the first to say she had a great life and career. She wasn't sad or confused but a strong black woman. Bogle is no better than a white writer who puts down a black but thinks its okay to coin a book Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies and Bucks because he's black, I'm sure if a white titled a book that we be yelling racism, don't Black talents deserve a better title?   Bogle also plays it safe by always talking about Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge, never telling the stories and never giving recognition to other black actresses like Nina Mae McKinney, Mildred Washington, Theresa Harris, Fredi Washington, Edna Mae Harris, Florence O'Brien, Louise Franklin, Daisy Bufford, Jeni LeGon Evelyn Preer, Suzette Harbin, Hilda Simms, Francine Everett, Shirley Haven and countless of others who had a chance to display their talents on the screen in Hollywood and helped fight discrimination and  help in the enhancement and betterment of blacks on screen but he gives all the credit to Horne and Dandridge, who didn't do as much as others if you want to get down to the truth, but I'm glad he don't talk about them in a way because he'll butcher up their life stories, I'll give them their due though. Many aren't remembered because maybe they didn't do as much, who cares about who has done more, were suppose to be remembering them for accomplishments and talents, right? White film historians sure remember all their stars, little or big. Someone like Louise Brooks, considered a early Hollywood icon is highly regarded as a great actress despite she only had a few good films and wasnt a big movie star. The woman is more remembered for one good film and a bobbed hairstyle but white historians will make sure you know her, her achievements and what she DID DO for the film industry.  Why can't Bogle be like that instead of criticizing everyone and judging them by white people's standards of what success and beauty is? I guess it's true that you gotta work twice as hard as whites to be someone in this world, whites can be remembered for little things, few successes, Blacks gotta have many successes to get rememberance and recognition even for other Blacks to remember them. Bogle is one of the few black film historians, you would think he would write more positively of blacks in Hollywood but he treats many worse then whites treated them when they were alive. Bogle never mentions Willie Covan and Marie Bryant (and appeared in movies also and was a good friend of Lena Horne's too) who choreograhed many white stars, they were behind the scenes but contributed to Hollywood. He suppose to be giving credit not taking away. Either Bogle is too lazy or likes to show favoritism because he sure won't tell other unsung talents stories. If he does he clutter it up with talking about their looks especially if he doesn't know how to write about them. Bogle knows nothing about the great career of Nina Mae McKinney, the first movie star of Hollywood and Europe, who done more films then any other black actress of her time, the first to appear on many magazines, she had so many achievements, yet he gives her one little page, if you don't know about a person, I rather you not write about them at all then to write lies. He never talks about the Black Cinema independent movie stars or the industry who was apart of American cinema, I guess their too hard for him to research, so he takes the easy path in writing about stars he already wrote about a million times. He never writes about Ethel Moses, Francine Everett, Dorothy Van Engle, Edna Mae Harris, Margaret Whitten, Tomiwitta Moore, Bee Freeman, Lorenzo Tucker, Monte Hawley, Ralph Cooper (created the first black studio in Hollywood), Oscar Micheaux, Spencer Williams and countless other black movie stars who appeared in films for blacks made by blacks in the 30's and 40's, I guess that's too mediocre for him but they done more for the enhancement of Blacks in movies by creating their own images, own roles, own portrayals, playing people from all walks of life unlike ones in Hollywood who were stuck playing the same types of roles and being the same images he always complaining about well I feel give due to ones who at least tried to do for themselves and become what they wanted but see they weren't cross-overs so their looked at as non-important by some which kind of dictated by whites who we should remembered and who's important. It's hard researching Black Cinema stars but boy it's worth it plus studying them, watching them perform gives you a good idea of who they were even if you can't find info on them. I still find the time to give them due and I'm no professional or anything but Bogle is a high class guy who only likes to write about Hollywood and his favorite gals Horne and Dandridge.   Ive done more research on unsung, forgotten stars then he has and it has been pleasurable teaching others on the net about blacks who contributed to stage and screen, stars who were just as important as Dandridge and Horne. I'm glad there are other people who are taking it upon themselves to tell the true stories of many unsung black legends and don't write in the same fashion as Bogle. Anyone who is hung up on skin color and don't want to think outside the box and like to hear the same stories then Bogle is for you but someone like me who researched many early black stars of stage and screen on my own and found out the real deal, found how they really were, found how they were really looked at, and found the true stories wouldn't appreciate Bogle's work much. I've talked with some legendary Blacks of the early years, some of their relatives also and they gave a completely different view then how Bogle describes them which shows he just goes by hearsay and documents and don't do accurate interviewing and researching.  I would think Bogle would spend more time on talking about the beauty of  black women from dark to light and  their wonderful achievements to the world.  Black women are quite unique but instead Bogle tells the  story of black women from white people's perspective it seems, he tells how black women were looked at from whites perspective not from a true black person's perspective that has pride for his race, maybe Bogle has a white person's way of thinking who is partial. Because I would commend these women, embrace and make the world embrace their beauty, courage, and talents; their many gifts to the world isn't as nearly written about as their skin tones are. He loves spending time writing about how light, dark or mulatto someone looks. Again, he makes it seem like such and such suffered because she was mulatto, light or dark, come on man, if she had a tragic life it was her own fault if she suffered. He makes it seem like color and race was the problem for everything which is false, actually many of these women profited from the race sometimes and plus women in general face discrimination, no matter what race or color. Don't you think these women went through enough being judged by skin tone or looks, they wished in their life for being to judge their talent, at least give them that now, Bogle doesn't. Who isn't discriminated against in this world? Bogle makes it look like Black is a curse when these female performers change the world and introduce the world to their greatness and the greatness of the race. He loves talking about whether someone should of passed for white or not like when he's talking about the great Fredi Washington. He misses out on showcasing  other great talents like Valaida Snow, Blanche Calloway, Una Mae Carlisle, Eunice Wilson, Adelaide  Hall and  others but that's okay because they have  been written  beautifully about by other writers. Well, many are dead so they cant stick up for themselves and Bogle takes advantage of that, he hasn't even interviewed or actually talked to ones who he writes about, he just goes by hearsay. Have your favorites but when you write a book, you can't show favoritism which he does all through which hurts others who has a story to tell but he only give honor to his faves. It seems no black can make him happy, he always has something to criticize. In his words every Black woman is a tragic, confused mulatto and every black man is a coon, or some other stereotype, he wouldn't say that to the young black guys or gals in entertainment today though, he takes advantage of the dead who can't stick  up for themselves.  There is a website on unsung black talents of stage and screen, you all will enjoy. http://www.angelfire.com/jazz/ninamaemckinney/ 
 It seemed like it took for ever for Carr to get around to his point. There was a lot of self promotion for a message that most of us implicitly understand. Perhaps a short essay would hav been best for this approach to stopping drinking. There are probably much more useful books out there for this difficult subject 
 We bought this cargo bag for a 900 mile trip from Pennsylvania to Florida. We didn't use it on the way there, but on our way home, we put two medium sized suitcases in it.  We barely made it 100 miles before the bag started coming unglued at the seams.  Fortunately (or unfortunately due to the color), we had a bright yellow roll of duct tape with us, so we were able to repair the bag as we drove.  After another 100 miles, we had to stop again and repair the bag.  We drove from Florida to Hilton Head, having to stop three times to repair the bag with the bright yellow duct tape.  From Hilton Head to Pennsylvania, the bag started to look like a nightmare of black, criss-crossed with yellow.  The last leg of our trip was nothing but a hassle, having to stop to fix the bag.    The company has a 30 day return policy, but we missed that by a day, having ordered it two weeks before our trip and being gone for two weeks, and they wouldn't even work with us on it.    
 This book was not enjoyed by either of my children.  It is so ridiculous that children in the age range for whom its written think its stupid, and the young ones who tolerate witless nonsense don't understand the meaning of the words.  I have an eleven year old and a four year old, both of which were bored by the second page.  The word search within words is a great concept, but I expected there to be some sense about it, so the kids could be entertained AND challenged by the text.  I am very disappointed 
 I was initially impressed by the topics to be covered in this book however found that few areas were well discussed.  Whilst myself exploring the differences between modern psychology and Nouthetic counseling, this book failed to completely discuss the areas detailed in its contents.  I was particularly disappopinted with the chapter "The myth of intergration" which had very little to do with intergrating modern psychology with Biblical concepts.  Examples were biased and information appeared to be delievered without the thoroughness that such texts require for today's critical minds.  As this review is titled, I believe the author had good intentions, however with exposure to Jay Adams and the like for his work, this book offers very little useful information.  
 I'm sorry to say it but I dont think this is a very good Bill Frisell album. It sounds a bit over-pretentious to make covers of orchestral music and it doesnt come out very well in my opinion. Besides anything that contains a song by Madonna, by definition cannot be good, right? These songs are all cover stuff that might be "interesting", if you like these songs in their original format, but for jazz-people: obviously there was a reason why we chose to listen to jazz and NOT to pop. Instead I would highly recommend listening to Ghost Town, Good Dog Happy Man, Nashville or Sound of Summer Running to get some real fresh genuine samples of Bill's harmonic world and abilities as a composer 
 There are some good things about this film -- it gives audiences an idea of how insidious the Nazi propaganda machine was, for one thing. It also shows the main character, Antoine Moreau, a (fictional) famous French mime, having his eyes opened to the reality of the Nazis' 'final solution' to the 'Jewish problem'. Brought to a Czech town that has been 'given to the Jews' by the Nazis in order to stage a performance that will be seen by the Swiss Red Cross delegation, hopefully persuading them that the Germans are not as monstrous as they have been portrayed, Moreau changes his original idea for the performance, hoping to get a 'silent' message to the Red Cross that will let them know the true fate of Jews (and other 'undesirables') at the hands of the Nazis.    I'll briefly mention a couple of less-than-positive observations, and then get into my main problem with the film.  The production values reminded me a bit of a made-for-TV movie -- and from time to time it seemed that the sound was a little out of sync with the picture. The image quality on the DVD could have been much better as well.  Also, the Shanachie DVD release is version of the film that has been dubbed with English.  This is, in the case of this film, not very well-done.  The cabaret singer, for instance, comes across as completely unbelievable in that her voice doesn't match her face or ethnicity in the least.  Everyone in the film winds up with an English accent, which detracts from any authenticity that might have been retained using subtitles instead of clumsy dubbing.  Another reviewer below brought up the dubbing problem as it apples to one of one of the children, Stella (portrayed by Linda Jablonska).  Her voice does not sound at all like that of a little girl. She develops a bit of a crush on Antoine, which in itself seems like a pretty natural occurrence under the circumstances -- here is a famous artist who has come to the village to stage a show, with her as one of the leads, who is kind and supportive and friendly to her, who listens to her ideas and feelings with attention and respect.  The problem I had was with one scene in particular.  Stella has been caught on the streets after curfew and chased by police.  She bites one of them and manages to elude them by squeezing through a break in a fence.  In the process of getting away, she gets muddy, scrapes herself bloody in a few places, and tears her clothing.  She goes to Moreau's hotel and climbs to the ledge outside his room and taps on the window.  When he opens it, he is shocked at her condition, lets her into the room, and begins to try to clean her cuts and scrapes, asking what had happened.  He then draws a bath for her, so she can wash herself.  As Moreau sits down, still in a bit of a daze over what has happened to her, she steps into the bath.  Just before she pulls her dress over her head, she says to him, `No looking.'  He shakes his head to bring himself out of his daze and says `Of course', then repairs to the adjoining bedroom, where he lies down on the bed to have a smoke, allowing her to conduct her bath in privacy.  A moment later, he hears a noise and looks up to see Stella emerge from the bathroom, completely naked, in a full-frontal nude shot.  Moreau gets up from the bed and lifts the covers, suggesting that she warm herself.  She climbs into the bed; he covers her up, and steps away to the other side of the room.  There is nothing about the scene that implies that anything improper occurred.  He has simply offered her care and comfort and sympathy.   This shot only lasts a few seconds, but I feel that, regardless of the director's reasoning for shooting it in the first place, it could have been left out.  If the point was to show that Moreau has either had morals all along, or that he has acquired them, it could have been demonstrated in a variety of other ways.  Earlier in the film, Stella had witnessed one of her caregivers, semi-nude, in Moreau's hotel room (Stella saw this from outside).  Given her `schoolgirl crush' on Moreau, it seemed natural for her to become upset over this.  As a result, however, the scene after the bath comes across as a young girl inappropriately mimicking adult sexual behaviour.  This, combined with the `adult' voice dubbed over Stella's, makes the scene even more disquieting.  There are some viewers who might argue that, in Europe, `standards' involving nudity and sexuality are not as reactionary as those in the US.  In many instances, I would wholeheartedly agree with them.  There is much hypocrisy in the dynamics of American culture and moral values, and not a little bit of neurosis.  However, the sexual objectification of children is something about which I feel very strongly...and I think the scene in question in this film amounts to exactly that.  Don't get me wrong -- I'm not so prudish that I turn away from even full-frontal nudity in a film, if it's not gratuitous and it's an integral part of the storyline...but here, it involves a prepubescent girl, and could have easily been left out.  It worries me bit that this point has not been made by other reviewers.  Have we become so numbed in respect to nudity in films that many can't recognize an instance where it's not only unnecessary, but potentially harmful?   I'm glad I've seen the film -- and I'd recommend it with a bit of praise and some strong reservations, as noted above. With all of the ridiculous claims from some quarters that the Holocaust never happened, I think it's vitally important for films on the subject to be made and seen.   The Czech film ALL MY LOVED ONES is an excellent film about this horrible time that has not gotten the attention it deserves -- seek it out.  n.b. -- This is the second time I have posted this exact review.  I noticed today (6 April 2006) that it has, for some reason, been removed from the site.  I've re-read what I've written, and I don't see anything objectionable or offensive.  The issues I have with the film are discussed straightforwardly.  If anyone objects to anything I've written here, I'd like to know what it is.  
 I had to read this for college.  I hated it! If it had been 100 pages it would have been much more interesting 
 It is necessary to correct the current trend of public commentary, which tends, systematically, not to understand events in the former Yugoslavia but to construct a propagandistic version of Balkan rivalries, designed to validate the existing post-modern myths and prejudices. This book faithfully reflects the post-modern blinkers that its author has helped first create and then perpetuate in his "coverage" of the Wars of Yugoslav Succession. This book reflects his (and their) belief that the Orthodox nations of Southeast Europe - embodied in "the Serbs" - are The Other vis-a-vis "The West" in the Huntingtonian sense. The author's assumptions are prejudiced in a coarse, primordial manner.   Judah's mindset helps us understand why the problem of the Balkans under UN/EU/NATO/UNMIK/KFOR/SFOR. . . is inseparable from the quandary of America under the bipartisan regime inside the Beltway, or that of Europe "united" under the Leviathan of Brussels. This book unintentionally poses many questions, and answers none. Can any meaningful unity of nations sharing European heritage be restored? To what extent, how, and why has the modern, secular, "post-Christian" West inherited the antipathy of West to the carriers of the Byzantine tradition? How do those two traditions converge, and how do they diverge, amidst the continuing onslaught of globalized secularism? Such issues are not merely political. They are as much "cultural" as theological, and they have been political all along. It is on the way we deal with them today that the future of our civilization will depend, and it that endeavor Judah has decided to side with the bad guys.  A book is badly needed to counter Judah's prejudice and ignorance about an area of the Old Continent which need never be the "powder keg of Europe." Though the Balkans, however delineated, contain many states and even more nations, they have one thing in common: for most of history they have not been masters of their own fate, but objects of policy by dominant outside powers. Though depicted by Judah as aggressing against their neighbors and generating wider conflicts, the Serbs in most cases had these conflicts foisted upon them by powerful outsiders and their local minions.  In particular Judah's attempt to relativize the Ustasha genocide of some 500-700,000 Serbs is scandalous. Had the same apparatus of quasi-historical whitewash been applied to the victims of Treblinka, such book surely would not have seen the light of day - and rightly so.  Even if all history-as a philosopher argued-is in some measure contemporary history, it need not be dominated by the obsessions of the day. The cause of tolerance in a troubled region can never be advanced by misrepresentation or by the sentimental lapse of seriousness which judges one patriotism as admirable and condemns another as inadmissible. This book is found wanting on all fronts 
 I own this product and have used it successfully on one notebook (dell). This  product is a port replicator NOT a docking station. For those that need tech mumbo jumbo its quite simple. Software controls this product and it operates according to very strict hardware rules. The drivers are very unstable plus there is no support for some ATI cards. I would recommend at least 1GB of ram with a 7200 rpm hard drive in order to prevent lag and the screen of death. Please don't buy if you don't know what video card you have or if your computer is slow. Trust me I have 9 laptops and only one worked with this product. Don't be a fool. (Nvidea cards have more support 
 I find Larry's thoughts are honest whether you like them or not.  I have a problem with his thoughts on Medicare and Social Security.  I am thirty-eight and have epilepsy.  I'm unable to work or drive due to the harm I could do to myself or others.  Perhaps Mr. Elder will give me a job.  I'll take it!  Do you think he will send his limo to pick me up for and take me home from work 
 This is a tough read. If you wanted an interesting book about Eninem's rise to popularity and behind the scenes dirt on how Dr Dre discovered and nurtured his raw talent, then don't buy this one because this book has NONE OF THAT! Instead, every chapter is a dry account of how Eminem's music affects American society, media and culture. Really dull stuff. He even manages to make the history of rap sound boring. I've read 18 books this year but could not get through this one. The author writes for Rolling Stone and it shows... If you've ever picked up a copy of Rolling Stone and were bored to tears by the over analyzation of music and its social impact, track-by-track, then don't buy this book 
 this is the worst book i have ever read,,it is very dull and unuseful..i9 bought it because i have read about the popularity of the surgeon who wrote it. i wish i can return it and get a refund..but i have threogh it in the tras 
 To use a Mets phrase, "It's amazing" that Jeff Pearlman can make a living focusing on the dark side of people. Baseball players are people - period. They have talent to swing a bat, run, throw a ball, but this does not make them enlighted, beyond temptation or anymore newsworthy than my father, an insurance executive who drank too much, was abusive to his family and as great as he was at work, could have been so much more.   This team is a microcosm of the real world and there are companies out there that make the story of the 1986 Mets pale in comparison.   Yes, Gooden and Strawberry could have been Hall of Famers, but they were strong at baseball and weak at life. This makes them human, not tragic.   We do love to put people at pedestles, simply to knock them off and watch them fall.   The 1986 Mets are my favorite team of all time. They had heart and they went into the season with the highest of expectations for them, and won.   What more did you really want from them?  Spend your money on a book with an ending that you don't already know. 
 Reading about statistics in this manner- the language, crammed text, etc. is a surefire narcotic, if that's what you want. It's heavy on quantitative research and methods- and tries a little too hard to pack it all in. You might use it as a reference but realize that you will probably get a headache from reading more that 5 pages in a sitting 
 This book was a big disappointment. It seems half the pages are just print outs of forms, budgets, etc. The information tucked between the pages of forms is the same stuff found in many more comprehensive and readable books. It seemed to be written by a computer, not a person. The index is weak as is the glossary. These folks made one movie and thought they could tell the rest of the world how it's done. The hubris is only exceeded by the vapidity. Sent mine back for a refund 
 As a JD PhD who teaches and researches American slavery I can say two horrendous things about this work. First, it is considered a classic and required reading for anyone who wants to understand the institution of slavery in America. Second, it is condescending, racist and continues to contaminate otherwise intelligent thought on the topic. Genovese contends that slave control was maintained through Hegemony, a concept developed by Gramsci to explain how the ruling class under capitalism uses ideology to persuade workers to consent its own moral, political and cultural values to their own detriment, a concept that can have no meaning in a regime of physical coersion. Genovese also claims that slavery was paternalistic, where slaves and their owners had reciprical rights and obligations. For example, according to him, slaves would "consent" to whippings that they saw as "reasonable." If you want a nice, pastoral portrayal of slaves singing while they cut "massa's" cotton, well this is the book for you 
 Werner Keller was a journalist who was enamored with biblical studies and turned his attention to archeology as a result of the burgeoning area in the late 40s (Dead Sea Scrolls, Nag Hammadi, etc.). The result was this book wherein Keller unashamedly declares - "The Bible is right after all." (p. xviii). He then proceeds to show us.  The book itself is well written and shows more than a little scholarship. He covers 4000 years of biblical history and he tries to integrate archeology with bible quotes and reference works, mostly from the 19th Century.  Yet the book is deeply flawed by Keller's desire to have everything validate the bible's positions. For example, he tries to show that Luke's dating of the census was not entirely incorrect since Quirinius had been in Palestine sometime "between 10 and 7 BC" (p. 344). Yet every scholar who has studied the issue claims that the census in 6 AD was the first census, so Quirinius' presence in Palestine in 8 BC is irrelevant. He spends an exhaustive amount of time detailing the history of the "Star of Bethlehem" and "proving" that the wise men would have arrived to see Jesus in December 7 BC. Then in the next breath he concludes that Jesus must have been born "before the onset of winter" (p. 354). In no case does he seem to realize that the "wise men", if they existed at all, came 2 years after Jesus' birth which is why Herod had all the children, 2 years or younger, slain. Or consider his remarks about the "one-time splendid synagogue" (p. 364) found in Capernaum. In fact, what is there is a public bulding of some sort, but there is no evidence that it was a synagogue until the 3rd Century.  You know that anyone who refers to Josephus as a "trusty historian" (p. 356) hasn't really done his homework.  It's a shame that Keller's theologically biases make a lot of the material unusable. This book can be dangerous if read by a person who is unable to separate fact from theology. Which is unfortunate because it does have a lot of good information and it is well written 
 This book covers the 172 model years 1977-1985, and talks about how production ended in 1985 with the model P.  The 172 lives on, of course, and if you happen to be flying one that's less than 20 years old this book misses the mark.  In trying to cover so many models, it is necessarily vague and non-committal on many items.  The book also inexplicably uses a Piper weight and balance chart as an example instead of a Cessna one.  If you're a pilot... or planning to become one... there's nothing here that you won't find in more clarity and detail in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) for the model 172 you're planning to fly.  I'd pass on this book 
 Alright, second time I did.   But I still enjoyed it.  I went into this just hoping bolo would be in a few one-on-one fights, and luckily he was.  He looks pretty tough and is not a bad kung fu actor.   But his directing job just fails miserably.  Btu with a ton of great character actors and all teh final fight baddies are funny, so it wasn't a total loss of a movie.  Not like some of bolo's newer day stuff.  Overall a comedy that works, but only in that aspect, the kung fu could have been really good, but then againagain, I have seen much much worse.  The final fight was fun  and was a good way to end the movie.    Pai Pao is pretty good, but thsi movie I think would be really popular around the ladies, cause I got pretty sick at looking at bolo.  And his fake beard just ruined his character.  Also there is a part where bolo gets mad, and then smoke comes out of his nose.  enjoy  Also, the movie would have recieved a 3, but  some of the kung fu was actually really good and a widescreened presentation would have helped tremendously.  But then again, maybe I didn't see it very well cause bolo and pai paio were the action directors.    So full screened and a watchable picture.  No distortion or fuzzy lines, would have been watchable I guess if the movie was better.  
 It's about time someone stands up and says : "red scare is all about mean politicans and innocents writers", "soviet spies never existed". That movie is telling us just that, by completely ignoring the spionage problem and the Corea war. One thing is particularly shocking, let's think of the millions of the victims of the Gulag when we see Stalin's poster in Streisand's room. "Freedom of speech will never exist in this country", says Redford-Pollack ; i just wish you were born in USSR, you criminal. 
 This movie is soooooo boring!!!! The only thing good about this movie is the superfly soundtrack laced by none other than Curtis Mayfield!!! Avoid this movie. It sucks 
 Alright, I'll confess to a slight infatuation with Jet Li, but even that did not make this movie more than passable. The plot is all over the place. It barely made sense - characters would suddenly arrive, locations would develop and then nothing would come of them. The bad guys were just silly - I like real malice and evil in my badies, I like to hate them and enjoy their come uppance. Well the silly twisted bad boy was just pathetic, and Jet Li, ever serene, was so far above the whole mess, so detached and lovely, just going through a very routine job of being Jet Li. The evil imperialist Yankees plotting to capture unsuspecting Chinese immigrants and enslave them were cartoon cuts outs. Like every other enthusiast of this genre I enjoy the carefully choreographed fights and they were good, but not good enough to redeem this film. Give me Kung Fu Hustle any time - now there is quality 
 This book is not good. The author's style is good but the story goes nowhere.  The characters in the book are really more parodies of people rather than being fully developed.   Waste of time 
 Oh my, all the terrible reviews for this book are true!!  Ms. Steel is excessively repetitive....I mean EXCESSIVE.  Ms. Steel goes into too much background on the characters way too early in the book...and she continues to repeat this information over and over and over and over...you get the picture.  I too found myself saying, "Okay, we get it already..."  I also agree with one of the reviewers who mentioned the bonding experience the men had.  I don't know the men Ms. Steel knows and hangs out with, but she had these me talking about their feelings with each other, as well as how their dysfunctional pasts had affected them.  Oh please, no man on earth talks that way.  Especially to other men.  This book is completely aweful.  The plot is so slow and does not grab the readers attention.  I have read many of Ms. Steel's books and I believe this one is her worst.  I have now started reading Sandra Brown and she is sooo much better.  I recommend "The Alibi."  So far that has been my favorite by her.  She has mystery, suspense, romance...  Her words are so much more descriptive and interesting than Ms. Steels.  To sum it up, I was completely disappointed with the book "Toxic Bachelors."  I highly recommend Sandra Brown, she is a much better author 
 Very disturbing --on serveral counts.  i had high hopes for Stephan flash back for someone 2000 years old of his life,relationships with other women in his life and most of all understanding his feelings towards Beatrix. i had a hard time following the story line due to the sexual exotic scenes with him and the Daughters. i really did not understand the purpose of it all in holding himself in.  i love Stephan and my heart went out to him because there was so much guilt within himself, feeling bad about Asharti and mostly the fact that Beatrix left him.  i wanted to cried through it all because i guess the love i wanted for him he could not have and if if he express his love towards Beatrix his idealist ideas held him back 
 This book is appalling. It is disempowering to women, providing false and very negative information about out of hospital births (with no reference to back it up), and generally gives a "don't worry your pretty little head and do what the doctor tells you" attitude--even if what the doctor tells you will endanger you and your baby.   In spite of what this book says, there are things you can do to minimize tearing (and episiotomies don't heal better than tears, in spite of what the book says), things you can do to improve your chances of a healthy baby without a cesarean or other medical interventions, and so on. Of course there are times these things are needed, but not nearly so often as the book suggests, and it's not nearly so random. It continually cites opinions as facts, without any evidence base.  There are much, much better books out there than this one. Don't subject yourself to the needless anxiety of this book 
 Sounds like a great item, but since I never received it. I can not give it an honest review 
 Far to difficult to pop, product didn't match picture.  But the company was very friendly and co-operative in the return process.  Would do business with this company again, but would buy one item as a test before buying in bulk.  Or I would just call the company 
 I happen to think that "Funcrusherplus" may be the best hip-hop album ever. For those of you who are fans of Company Flow, the "Little Johnny From..." album, will be a huge disappointment. For those of you wanting to MC, pick it up and get some good beats. Don't waste you time other wise. Without the tight lyrics from El-P and Bigg Jus the album is nothing more then a reminder that Co. Flow has a strong original sound. Don't waste your money, get something you'll actually listen to 
 Like another reviewer below, I got it because it claimed it would increase the range over the not-particularly-directional antenna inside my laptop (Vaio PCG-V505EXP, running the latest service pack of XP Pro).  But I found LOTS of problems:  1.  It did no better at picking up signals than my laptop's built-in, and if the antenna wasn't aimed optimally it did worse.  2.  When the antenna was aimed optimally, it saw signals I can normally connect to, but this card had problems connecting to them consistently ("limited connectivity") whereas my laptop's built-in WiFi has that "limited connecivity" problem only occasionally and briefly (at the same locations, with the same signals).  3.  If I tried to do a Repair (from the Wireless Connection icon right-click menu), it would hang on the "disabling the wireless adapter" step.  4.  The Utility that came with this installed itself in the tray.  But trying to use that utility from the tray would cause it to crash every time (volunteering to "Send Report").  5.  When I tried the Safely Remove icon from the tray, then tried to Stop the card so I could remove it, that process hung forever, and I had to force a shutdown (the ugly way) to get it out of that.  6.  Btw, even if it would work in SOME situations (tho what situations those might be I'm not sure!), it's no good in situations where you are moving the laptop around even when close to the signal.  So for those you would want to move back to the built-in WiFi.  But while I have a switch on my laptop to disable that (when I want to use another connection method instead), there is no switch (in hardware or software) that I could find to disable this card temporarily.  Thus no easy way to switch back and forth between directional (using this card) and non-directional (using the built-in WiFi).  Btw, after I uninstalled all the software that came with it, my built-in WiFi still didn't work (it said other software had taken it over!).  I had to do a System Restore (to right before I installed this card) to get my built-in WiFi back to working normally.  So if you do get this card, make sure that you try it out quickly after installing it, before you install anything else (unrelated), so that you'll have a good System Restore point if you want to Undo everything that resulted from trying out this card 
 This book is not very helpful and confusing to use. A lot of the information it provides is information you can read on the food labels IF you buy those brands. 
 I would have preferred a text that merely reported employers' compliance obligations in an objective manner, rather than portraying employers as the enemy.  I generally found the text to be highly politicized and, to some extent, anti-management.  This book does little to bridge the gap between the business community and academia 
 This dress up trunk is of very poor quality.  All the dress up items are thin, flimsy and poorly made with frayed unfinished hems and edges.  The trunk itself won't last more than 5 minutes, if you can get it to stay  together at all.  Don't waste you time or money!  You and your child will be sorely disappointed 
 Yes, it's awful. Truly frighteningly awful 
 Get tapes or CDs of this fabulous material. Forget the VHS/animation; it severely distracts from the great comedy. The extra touches and music on the VHS are downright annoying 
 Disclaimer: I am not a fan of Larry Summers.  I didn't care for him when I was an intern at Treasury, and as an alum I really don't care for him as president of Harvard.  But even I think this book is unfair to Summers and goes too far in trying to villify the man.    Bradely has written a book that is very easy to read and draws almost all of the issues enveloping Harvard in easy to digest, black-and-white dramas between Summers (always in the black hat) and various members of the faculty and student body (always portrayed sympatetically).  This book makes no pretence of being objective or looking any further than skin-deep at the controversies that surrounded Summers before the most recent blow-up over his comments on women in science.  Several chapters end with essentially the same line: by doing X, Summers had further consolidated his rule over the university.  If all of this is true (it's not), Summers would be the absolute dictator of Harvard Yard by now.  In fact, what has been written here is basically an expanded, book-edition copy of the Harvard Crimson from 2000 to the present.  There is little new in the book that readers of Harvard's student newspaper don't already know other than a few re-interviews that Richard Bradley has done with various personalities involved in the recent events at Harvard.    What's lost here is that what is going on at Harvard is a microcosm of what's going on at many other American universities, and that much of it isn't new.  As far back as I can remember (and I come from a family of academics), students and faculty alike have hated their university presidents, viewing them as uninterested in academics or out of touch with their student bodies.  As at Harvard, with the decibel level of campus politics higher today than at any time since the 1960s, there is a lot of talking (or complaining, depending on one's perspective) going on and less respect for opposing viewpoints.  Harvard is hardly unique in this respect.    Bradely castigates Summers for his handling of several episodes with faculty (most noteably the Cornel West debacle) but misses the broader trend that acadmics as a whole have been getting into narrower and narrower specalties that prevent their work from being of much use to anyone.  This doesn't mean that Summers was justified in how he treated West, who was (and is) a true educator, but it does deny this book some much-needed context.    Similarly, Bradley's comments on Summers' stress on achievement by students misses that the same line was toed by the genteel Neil Rudenstine, who once told the Crimson that 'students don't come to Harvard to have fun' when asked why the university maintains an academic schedule that places fall term finals immediately after winter break.  This was a particularly poor-timed comment after a rash of student suicides on campus and reports that Harvard's student suicide rate was twice the national average.  Overall, only the most die-hard Summers haters will find anything valuable in Harvard Rules.  Everyone else interested in the state of campus would be better of reading the Crimson from time to time 
  If you are hoping to learn more about meditation than you are better off knowing what you already know rather than reading this book.  The utter banality of it is bound to make your mind squirm as you read through mindless jargon every newager is privy to.    I'm not sure how this guy gets away with writing the same stuff over and over again under different titles.    It is very clear from reading the text that the author has no direct experience of higher states of meditational awareness. It's like someone writing a book on quantum physics without having any understanding of basic physics.    The whole thing is akin to the age old crookery which asks for your pennies giving nothing in return.    This book like many others by the author, trivializes ancient Vedic culture and civilization.  Only a Westerner or Punjabi (Deepak Chopra !! ) could have done it.  As long as masses in their kindergarten state fail to exercise their discrimination they are bound to get duped by these small time crooks.     
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 I purchased the updated, 3rd edition recently and anyone who can actually understand the contents and retain the information, my hat is off to you. I have been a personal trainer for over 7 years and thought this book would supply me with some extra knowledge. Was I wrong. Way too technical. Way too many references and studies with many times contradicting themselves. Very non user friendly. I have read paragraphs to co-workers who are more advanced than me and even they shook their heads. DO NOT BUY if you are looking to advance your personal training skills and knowledge. I have passed several certifications and consider myself fairly knowledgable, but this book left me scratching my head and saying WHAT???? 
 I have enjoyed several books by Anna Quindlen and looked forward to her latest offering. I settled down for an evening of reading 3 nights in a row before I finally gave up. I found the writing trite and boring. I didn't care about the characters as it took too long for them to become something. I'm wondering if this was something she wrote earlier in her career and tried to make a silk purse from a sow's ear. Rise and Shine? Not this time 
 After only 3 months the SanDisk Cruzer Micro 2GB died.  Data was lost, could not be read.  Both my desktop and laptop computer wanted to reformat the Cruzer, but when I tried to format, it could not. Flash drive is totally useless. I replaced it with a Kingston Data Traveller and I hope it lasts longer.

 It's from this book that Led Zeppelin's reputation as rock n roll "bad boys" is largely responsible. If you are a teenage boy or have the mentality of a teenage boy, it no doubt illicits great admiration and hero worship and you will enjoy this book. But to anyone else the individual band members simply come across as sh*ts. Even so, I still think they are worthy of a better book than this. Wild on the road behaviour-which is the main contents of this book largely- is really very common place for a band from that era. I just simply can't understand why it's represented as being so unique. When infact, what is really great about Led Zeppelin is their fantastic music. The writer really fails to capture this or what makes the band as individuals tick. Although he can deliver some salcious tales it becomes pretty obvious he knows very little about them. The photographs are pretty uninspired too. I think the real Led Zeppelin story is full of the heights of success and the lows of human tragedy, and various trials and tribulations inbetween which constitutes their real growth as individuals and musicians. But I have quite honestly never seen any writer particularly, let alone this one- tackle this skillfully. Anything very meaningful tends to be brushed over in favour of petty gossip-mainly to impress a certain type of male fan.  I still think the definative book about them which is more truly representive of their lives and music has yet to be written. 
 I really have to say that this is the worst management book I read. [...] Moreover, the book is full of clichs. I kept reading it, expecting that the good part was coming, but there was no good part! I eventually reached the end of the book where he says "If you don't try, you will never know", and "don't let anything grind you down", as if these were very revealing statements. This is what we tell little kids, and we all learned this when we were 5 years old, and I find pitiful that the author has no other ideas to conclude his book with. I would never recommend this book to anyone in any business field. 
 This book was an attempt to make money off of someone who has adoring fans.  This book had little if no input from Eminem himself.  I just recently bought HIS book, Angry Blonde.  If you want the truth from the guy himself, buy that book instead 
 First, let me say that this novel is brilliant, insightful and lyric.  It manages to be thought-provoking and entertaining at the same time and is just a true joy to read on so many levels.  That said, the reading of "The Quiet American" in this audio book format leaves something to be desired.  Joseph Porter has a lovely voice well-suited to the narrator, and even well-suited to the main female character Phuong.  However, as soon as the titular quiet american breaks his silence, the feigned American accent Porter reads with is simply appalling. I found it beyond distracting.  I find that if you can't do an accent well for a public reading, best to leave it alone and read in your own voice.  Joseph Porter could be forgiven for reading the lines of the American characters with a British lilt.  I don't see why there was no reason to forge ahead just to decimate the reading so awfully 
 This book is still filled with wrong answers in its chapter tests. An example of this can be found in a question in chapter 1 that doesn't even get covered until chapter 2. I expect so much better from Sybex!!! 
 Don't be fooled by the title of this cookbook.  First, it is filled with exotic and gourmet, not to mention expensive, recipies.  The choice of ingredients might be fine if you live in New York or San Francisco, but here in northern Wisconsin many ingredients just aren't available.  (And if they were, would you fix squab or fried rabbit for Tuesday night dinner for your family?)  A second disappointment is the copious use of butter, oil and heavy cream.  This is the first time I've ever been so disappointed in a book I ordered that I will be returning it 
 We looked for a trash truck that our 4 year old boy could play with. On the surface, the Bruder looked the part. Not as cartoon-looking as some, the fact that it looked like a real trash truck but had few obvious breakable parts made it seem like an ideal choice.   Actual play testing though shows this product isn't very well-built, at least not enough to withstand normal wear and tear. This truck wasn't subjected to being thrown down the stairs, jumped on, etc. It's been just played with, but it started coming apart quickly.   The hinged door in the back of the truck is a poor design. The plastic hinges on the truck are too thin, and break easily. The plastic hinges on the door start to bend after multiple open/closes, and the plastic weakens and breaks off.   The hinged front compartment and rear sections are difficult to operate, and stick easily. Items put into the cab (like the essential green army man who drives the truck) easily get caught in here and are very difficult to remove.   Worse though is the key point of this toy, the ability to latch the trash can to the lifting/dumping mechanism. This is way to complex for a child, and the intricacy in getting a solid connect is difficult even for an adult.  If it's not hooked up right, the can falls off when you try to lift it; very frustrating.   Some little pieces (rear view mirror, etc) broke off easily and early on, but we kind of expected this. The parts were simply too small and fragile to last long. I don't hold this part against the design; part of the attraction was that it looked like a real truck, and I don't think there's an easy way to add small details without some fragility.  While this is orignally was one of my sons favorite toys, he can't really play with it the way he'd like to. While he still enjoys driving it around the house, he can't pick up the trash and dump it without an adults help, and that's a shame.   For the price, I expected so much more. 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 I started this novel after reading Erdrich's Love Medicine. While it is clearly not as lyrically written, it is more accessible, and I admired Erdrich's inventiveness as she creates a very unique set of characters. I never finished "Beet Queen", quitting not that far from the end. When Celestine's child turned out to be so impossible, it was the last straw. "Beet Queen" is just too determinedly bleak, to no higher purpose I could discern or discover in reading reviews here. 
 Waste of money if you are not into the girl- girl thing- nearly every story has it.  And the ones that don't are worse.  terrible.  Bad writing 
 I understood that The Moonstone is a classic so I decided to read this to be culturally literate. Well the story line may be interesting but the writing is atrocious. It is curricular, bloated, and seemingly pointless. The characters just keep rattling. A lot of writers fill in the story with descriptions of time and place to give an atmosphere to the story. This writer (Wilkie Collins) just fills it with unrelated trivia. Every once in a while I would go back a few pages to see what I must have missed. When I read again there was nothing there to miss. Ether Wilkie is extremely monotonous or other writing from this period is and I am just now lucky enough to find out. I talked to others about this and they said; "Now you know why Sherlock Holmes is so popular"   
 The film opens with three men arriving at a house. They draw their pistols and rush in. Shots are fired, and Tuco escapes. Then a bounty hunter visits an isolated house, searching for "Jackson". He learns the new name of "Bill Carson" (they were part of a gang of robbers). There is an exchange of opinions, shots are fired. The bounty hunter leaves to report to his boss, and perform another job. Next we see a wanted man captured by three men. Another man shows up to eliminate the competition, like a lion driving away hyenas. The wanted man is turned in for the reward. But his hanging is prevented, and he rides away to be recycled. [Can you believe this?]  Tuco catches up to his former partner and captures him, the tables are turned. [This is like a cartoon.] Just like it looks like it is over for "Blondie" a runaway wagon appears to begin a new story! A dying man tells of a buried treasure of stolen payroll. Now Tuco must care for "Blondie" because he knows the name on the grave that contains the treasure. As they ride away, they see a gray troop of cavalry coming for them. The gray turns out to be dust on their blue uniforms. [Another joke.] Now they are prisoners and sent to a camp. [Was there really combat in the southwest?] This film is like a succession of short stories linked through the same characters.  Tuco manages to escape from the train. Later "Blondie" escapes and they meet again. There is more gunplay in eliminating the competition for their business deal. They arrive at a huge cemetery, much too large for the small town shown in this film. [Obviously staged.] And so there is a showdown between the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Scratch one rival. The film ends with a sick joke about hanging. I wonder why some people rate this film highly?  The vocalized song means there is no problem in translation to another language. [Isn't it funny?] The most interesting part is how a 1950s style Western was created by Europeans after they became obsolete in Hollywood. Not that they can't do better. 
 That should have been the title of this movie as it describes the use that the talents of a high-profile cast & normally respectable director are put to.  Another possible title is "It's All About the Groceries", 'cause I'm hard-pressed to think of a reason, other than money, why anybody involved would've signed on to this project.  It starts promisingly, with atmospheric shots of the Golden Gate Bridge rising through fog over San Francisco.  The camera plunges through the fog to hone in on the image of a knife being held to a woman's throat. Once again, Ashley Judd is a victim in jeopardy . . .so it seems.  Then the 'victim' proceeds to open a can of whoop-a** all over the perpetrator and beats him to a bloody pulp.  One starts to think that this might be getting good, especially after Ashley's apparently super-competent police detective is revealed to have anger issues, a pretty hefty drinking problem, a propensity for picking up strangers in bars & having rough sex with them . . .and some grisly skeletons in her closet.  I was interested to see what Judd would do with this opportunity to play a character with a dark side instead of her usual noble victim.  Unfortunately, not enough.  Ms. Judd is a luminously beautiful actress, even with a severe short haircut meant to make her look tough, I suppose. It is not hard to believe that men would be drawn to her like bugs to a flame.  She has not developed the range of emotion to really carry a complex character like Jessica, though, playing it distressingly one-note.  Is she ecstatic?  Depressed?  In a drug-induced stupor?  The way Judd plays it, it could be any, or all, of the above.  I like Ashley Judd, but she is in danger of turning into the female version of Richard Gere--a performer with real potential who keeps choosing flashy junk-food roles that do not challenge her talent.  "Kiss the Girls" was the high-water mark & each subsequent film has been weaker than the last.  This movie is worth the price of a rental, but I'd take a pass on purchasing it.  For a better treatment of female-cop-with-dark-secrets-and-Issues, & a stronger movie all-around, I recommend "Murder by Numbers" with Sandra Bullock 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 Crying of Lot 49 Flat - Senseless - One dead accumulation of words - In,fact this book is, at times, so porely constructed all reviewers who herald it should be lead directly to the meat grinders. A book worthy of burning.  Has writing become a whim of the well read, a process of linking obsure facts only to then be skewed by prolix innanities as simple segways to streams of consciousness Poor Plot Poor Writing  Read - Umberto Eco's Foucaults Pendulum. If you are looking for conspiracy. Do not read this book (unless you have time to waste or have by some possibility exhausted every other option on earth)   
 If you are a hardcore John Waters fan, you are in for a big disappointment. Where's the sleeze, John? You owe me 15 bucks! 
 yes this book is about a love story between bussy and dame monsoro.  her husband monsoro is not getting any, how would you feel. this book teaches you a lesson and this lesson, don't buy books you don't know, cause they [are bad 
 Simply not enough of Amy Weber in the film. In the scenes she was in she looked lovely, but I was hoping to see more. Anyone hoping to see Weber get down and dirty will be disappointed 
 I bought a paperback that included both "Of Mice and Men"(OMM) and "Cannery Row."  For me, "Cannery Row" seemed like it was not written by the same author. Whereas OMM had me in its grip, even though I have seen several movie versions, "Cannery Row" left me asking just what was so great about Steinbeck anyway?    I just think whereas OMM is a timeless story (the story of two guys, one smart, one not-so-sharp but innocent, trying to make a buck will play out forever), "Cannery Row" just doesn't seem to withstand the test of time. Yes, Steinbeck has some nice still-relevant social comment about the impact of the automobile and how the traits we don't admire in someone are the same traits that can make one successful. Howver, outside of that, the story was just a mediocre character study.  And therein lied the problem for me-too many characters I had no interest in.   I have to side with the other reviewers who suggest Steinbeck's other work in order to absorb the full wonder of this man.            
 Into The Woods is one of my Sondheim favorites.  Having seen the PBS presentation of this, I am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this DVD is edited.  Rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction, this DVD uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close-ups.  This especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play; the staging.  By forcing the viewer's perspective, this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath.  I am hoping that somebody releases a version that does not presume to edit out the director's vision 
 This is a complete waste of money and time.  This guy has no credible recommendations.  He hasn't a clue as to what xtreme PM is.  
 I've had the misfortune to come into constant contact with Blanche Boyd seeing that she's a professor at my college. She berates students' work if it doesn't match her narrow definition of what "good" writing is and trashes well known authors, probably because she is nowhere near as successful. She is self-absorbed and abrasive, as is this book. Do yourselves a favor and DON'T waste your time on it 
 i still not receive this item, i have wait for a month already! 
 I had hoped that there would be a fair amount of vegetarian recipes in this book but was very disappointed to find precious few 
 I could not believe the quality in these shoes...HORRIBLE! The material feels and sounds like cardboard or paper. They have an awful smell and are uncomfortable. I bought chinese shoes in china town for $2, they were wonderfully comfortable, still smelled funny, but they were awesome.these are not!  
 I gave this cookbook 2 stars because although it was exactly what I was looking for, it came in an unacceptable condition. My mother had the original book for as long as I can remember and it had become well worn. Pages were falling out of it. This book was for all intesive purposes the same. When I gave it to my mom for Christmas she was so excited. Unfortunately, the three ring binder on it was broken. This is very bad considering that you need them to turn the pages. I would say that considering it was brand new, this was unacceptabl 
 I love The Who, a big part of my youth, probably in my DNA, but let's not kid ourselves: This is professional rock and roll made by professional rock and rollers. Is there any lyric here that Pete hasn't written before? Still writing about getting your first hit single?! And sadly the music sounds like Face Dances and All the Best Cowboys..etc, but not The Who Sell Out or Empty Glass. The band itself sounds faceless, generic. The only redeeming features are the raspy passion in Roger's voice and Pete's right hand.  I hope the complete album makes garbage of this review, but unless Pete has written truthfully and passionately about something or anything of what his life and the world has been like in the last twenty years I'm afraid, like Wire & Glass, it will only be a rehash of previous works, no matter how good it sounds. Here's hoping I'm wrong 
 Great premise, great disappointment. Formulaic, improbable, confusing. Ludlam is clearly honing his skills in this early work. He ended a different book than he started. Bottom line: keep shopping 
 I bought this thing for my brother and he used it four or five times.  The battery is "defective" and needs to be replaced.  I've heard on a number of sites that the batteries are "defective."  Don't buy this thing if you plan on using it without an adapter of some sort.  Costs $35 to replace the battery, which is built-in and requires sending the whole machine back.  With shipping, I'm sure it costs over half of what most people pay.  The only thing "defective" is the machine itself (and the wonderful people at Audiovox).  Other than that it's great!! 
 I remember, not quite four years ago, when this magazine actually had PC substance and catered to a sophisticated PC-oriented market. Now, it's thin, hollow, interminably off-topic and ad-choked.  
 Beware Fr. Reese SJ's unconventional opinions and you will not be misguided by unorthodox Catholic thought.  He is a very political character himself and colors his statements.  His recent attack on limits placed by Pope Benedict against practicing gays entering the priesthood betray an extreme bias.  He contends pedophilia the problem although the vast majority of abuse cases were against adolescent boys, not young children -- just as example of his penchant for being loose with facts 
 My husband inflated it and was extra careful not to overinflate it but it still popped before the kids even had a chnace to try it. they were so disappointed:( this has now happened twice!!!!! fyi, the first one we inflated and it deflated within days (slow leak). what a waste! it is so heavy that it would cost $20 to mail it back for a replacement. don't bother. 
 I ordered this item in July , and I've been getting order delay notices every 15 days or so. Now the estimated shipping is January 2007 ! I think I'm going to celebrate the first anniversary of ordering this product. The item was still shown as In Stock, untill very recently. If you are planning on styling your hair in this era, don't order this product 
 These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much! 
 This book had about as much information as a 5 year old on changing your identity. Any fool could figure out the methods the author uses 
 It was really good in the first month I have it.  I loved it and used it almost everyday, and I threw away the receipt, cause I don't think I will need it anymore.  However, after one month, It stop heating.  It is the worst quality heating pad I ever have. It said it has 5 year warranty, it can't even work more than 5 weeks.  I won't buy any of HoMedics' product anymore.     
 As a clinician-scientist, I believe in evidence based medicine There is no evidence base to support the work-out shown here to my knowledge have been proven to build bones as opposed to other types of exercise. As scientist from respected institution like NASA can tell you, the only most important way the body needs to stimulate bone building is periodic weight-bearing exercises & stepping. The same view is shared by neurophysiologists of NIH of USA This kind of title is extremely misleading & should be taken with a grain of sal 
 It's obvious that my review differs from the majority, but I emphatically stand by my opinion: this movie was really, really, really lousy.   Keifer Sutherland (whom I generally like a lot...he is why I watched this turkey in the first place) portrays a stone alcoholic, chain-smoking, gravel-voiced, burned out bum of a cop who guzzles gallons of booze and staggers from scene to scene like one of the zombies in Dawn of the Dead. This is his worst performance (that I have ever witnessed) and to make matters even more grim, the entire plot is a confusing, poorly-directed mess. I think that the majority of Keifer's boozing is due to his embarrassment over appearing in this truly wretched movie.  If you insist on viewing this bomb, you will hear the word "Jabberwocky" at least 10,000 times (and come to hate it with a white-hot intensity)....you will see Keifer Sutherland's character drink countless gallons of whiskey (often straight from the quart bottle at his desk in the police station) and smoke at least 9,500 cigarettes (this movie could be used as aversion therapy by A.A. or the American Lung Association)....you will see ghosts, apparitions, and silly psychic flashbacks that are about as convincing and relevant as those in "Sabrina the Teenage Witch". At one point, a character wants to convey the name of the villain to Kiefer in a "psychic vision", so rather than just say the name (which would be way too easy), he lures the villain to appear in a mirror ("through the looking glass")....silly.  The basic premise of this movie resembles the TV series "Medium", in which a psychic can sense details about a crime by touching objects associated with the crime....but the TV show is vastly superior in every respect: acting, plot, direction, and characterization. Also, the only psychic visions that a drunk of this magnitude is likely to see involve elephants....pink ones. This movie would not qualify as a tolerable made-for-TV drama...and that is very, very sad.  There are numerous allusions to "Alice in Wonderland" (the original name of this bomb was "After Alice"): Kiefer starts having his "psychic visions" after falling through a hole, a character is named "Hatter", etc. etc. I assure you that none of this cuteness will add to your viewing pleasure in any way.   So, you can listen to the other reviewers and waste your time and money, or listen to the warning I am offering loud and clear: there is a reason that this movie was never released in theaters...and God knows, it shouldn't be released in your home either. Avoid it....you really don't need to hear the word "Jabberwocky" 10,000 times....do you ??? 
 This wanna be director obviously tries every cliche in the book and tries to gain credibility by using over the hill non talents like Ryan Oneal. Plain and simple....just pass this one up 
 this was steve mcqueen's last film and that is sad as this is not even able to be called an action movie or a comedy. this mess is "based on the true story" of bounty hunter ralph "papa" thorson and it just never gels into and kind of film at all. not the way to say goodbye to the great steve mcqueen, get bulliet or the sand pebbles instea 
 Sorry but I don't like this, always the same distorded guitar, always the same riff, feel like it was the same song from the beginning 'til the end, poorly done  
 Through the incredible movie 'Loved' I got to know the Counting Crows with their amazing number 'Miller's Angels'. From then on I started buying almost all their albums. So I don't need this album at all. It doesn't even have the best songs on it (at least the ones I like best).  IF I WERE THE PRODUCER I WOULD HAVE MADE A 'BALLADS' ALBUM. But since that wasn't coming I produced one privately. I copied my favourite ballads on a cd and called it (of course) 'Counting Crows Ballads'. Perfect when you are snoozing with your loved one on a Sunday- or Saturdaymorning. Here come the tracks in the correct order (the order is VERY important for the mood):  1. Carriage (from 'Hard Candy') 2. Have you seen me lately (from 'Across a wire'... the best version!) 3. Angels of the Silences (from 'Across a wire'. Yep, the unplugged version... MUCH better than the loud one!) 4. Long December (from 'Across a wire') 5. Holiday in Spain (from 'Hard Candy') 6. Perfect Blue buildings (from 'August and everything after') 7. Black & Blue (from 'Hard Candy') 8. All my friends (from 'Desert Life') 9. I wish I was a girl ( from 'Desert Life') 10. Speedway (from 'Desert Life') 11. Miller's Angels (from 'Mercury Falls')  I bet they are going to steal this idea from me, and otherwise you guys can :-) Enjoy!   
 if you want to read an exceptional book saying the same things as this one but MUCH, MUCH better.   Mistry should be embarrassed to be writing, or rather re-writing, Midnight's Children with less spark, creativity, and far less to actually say. It is unoriginal!  Although this book is good, I frankly couldn't get past that I had JUST read the Rushdie previous to this book and felt like Mistry should have been chastized rather than lauded for putting this book out.   Oprah should pick up the Rushdie too 
 There's plenty of Star Trek websites that feature schematics of starships featured in this book.  Most of them provide more information than published.  A Google search will turn up these sites and you'll enjoy the lot of them 
 Does Deniro even appear in this movie?  Talk about false advertising.  
 Really liked it.   Would have rated it 4-star. But last night it suddenly stopped working and would not turn  on anymore. Only the clock works. Just one month out of warranty. From other reviews, this seems to be a common problem 
 The book and CD were poorly packaged. The CD was loose and had glue/gum on the playing face. 
 A "5 STAR" CD!  All I can say is Hurry, Don't Wait to Get Nick Colionne's latest CD, each and every track on this CD is fabulous.  If you are not already a NC fan, check him out.  And, be sure to catch one of his live performances, they are not to be believed.  You will be a fan for life 
 Professor Yoo makes many seemingly compelling arguments in favor of his contention that the President has virtually unfettered authority sanctioned by our constitution, but, as reasonable as his arguments may seem, what I find to be the underlying flaw is that he's arguing that unrestrained authority of the chief executive is somehow consistent with the principles of constitutional democracy and the rule of law upon which our system of government is based.  Frankly, this is a completly cognitively dissonant position; advocating an authoritarian right in the name of democracy just doesn't  meet the test of reason. It's functionally identical to the argument that "We have to destroy the village to save it" made popular during the Vietnam War.  Benjamin Franklin famously said; "Those who would give up essential Liberty to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety". Clearly the good professor doesn't seem to grasp this essential concept as elucidated by one of our most respected and revered Founders.  
 Don't let the cover fool you, this film isn't half as fun as you may hope it is. Maybe it's my own fault, but I was expecting something more like "Groove", or at least something interesting to watch. And it's not for my lack of knowledge of the bands, I often listen to Joy Division/New Order/Happy Mondays, and more from that scene. However, this seemed much more like the story of Tony Wilson and The Factory, than it did about the music, and almost came-off as a documentary. I almost stopped watching it out of boredom, but saw it through anyway. Now I wouldn't call this bad, it had it's good parts, just not many. 
 My advice is to watch this in French, which is less painful especially if you don't speak French.  In English, its unbearable.  Slow?  At one point the DVD froze and I didn't realize it for several minutes 
 I would possibly recommend this book for children but not for the serious reader or someone who needs information pertaining to African-American scientists and inventors. The book has a very elementary style of writing and few citations of where the information was obtained. I was expecting a book with deep information of African-American history but was disappointed in the juvenile nature of the book 
 If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS 
 If you're getting this book for hardcore reference material I would be careful. I literally had the book 5 minutes and discovered a handful of mistakes.  Ex.  -Jim Lee's entry has the best selling X-Men #1 as being released in 2001 instead of 1991.  -The timeline has Sandman ending in 1997 when it was actually 1996.  If you buy this book get it for light reading. Do not use it for quoting comic fact until you check the validity of what you are using. Like I said.. I noticed these two mistakes after skimming the book for 5 minutes. I am afraid of how much more I will find once I start digging in 
 It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.  It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends?  I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something.  
 Ok, let me say one thing first: I have yet to finish the novel.  I don't know that I will.  So can I really write a fair, balanced review? No.  But I couldn't keep reading without saying a few things about the book.  First off, someone should have edited this book.  I've yet to encounter the typos mentioned in other reviews, but the author tends to drone on and on about things I couldn't care less about.  Second, where in the world are these people from?  The actions of the two main characters are so superficial and staged that it made me lose interest almost immediately.  Scott even thinks to himself several times that he doesn't like Ryan, but continues to hang out with him because he's so cute.  Next thing you know, he's playing his flute for him in a completely ridiculous scene that had me groaning out loud.  And the camping trip....I mean, come on.  Let us in on a real story, with believable actions, not where the two characters seem to be merely drifting through a string of set pieces that don't make sense.  Third...ah heck, I'm not even going to get started on the corny dialogue.  Let's just say I hate that I spent money on something and I can't bring myself to get through it.  But sheesh.  I compare this to Common Sons a little, where the characters sometimes behaved and said things that didn't seem real.  The only difference is, with Common Sons, the two main characters were at least interesting enough to care about.  They held that novel together even during its hard to swallow parts.  This one simply falls apart page after page.  
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 Besides the fact that the book is "dry", in which most Math theory based books are,  the examples are just the basis step towards solving a problem.  I equate it to teaching a child how to add, and just giving them the example "1 + 0", then assume they can figure out the rest.  There are no answers, either in the back of the book for particular exercies, nor was a study guide made available.  What is really shocking is that it's the most expensive book out there! Not to mention that there isn't any programming steps made available.  Great text for a Math major ... horrible textbook for Computer Science Majors, mainly because  computer science majors would want to see programming examples and may not be as strongly math oriented as a Math major would be 
 Frequent with biographies, the subjects by nature or design overshadow their conveyance, the lives greater than the telling. With Alex Kershaw's handling of London, the disjunctive telling of the life seems to overshadow the greatness of the subject. Kershaw provides documented anecdotal events in London's life, but these episodes are weakly connected, seemingly the paragraphs lack smooth continuity, making the reading of some sections an effort to connect the sequence of events a muddled mess. In a section of Chapter 4, "The Boy Socialist," Kershaw describes London's burn-out from cramming for entrance-exams for Berkeley, his passing with distinction, his fleeing the world by setting sail, his re-course to moor, his impulse to get drunk on shore, and then his arrival "at Berkeley in autumn 1896, in high spirits" (46-47). THEN, we're offered an ancedote about London's comeuppance in a boxing ring, a recollection by a contemporary about his attire, followed by the philosophical influence of Herbert Spencer's book (48).  Kershaw's neglect of the biographer's role (and duty) to segue events, providing coherence and significance in the synthesizing of complex elemental parts to a life whole, distracts me from the subject. Yet I expect all biographies to be as great in the telling as their subjects, like Johnson's Boswell or Wolfe's Donald or Joyce and Wilde's Ellman or Genet's White. Kershaw does indeed emerge as a singular teller of a great life, and his telling is marked by fleeting absurdities involving subtly recurring images of human mastication and digestion: "Bite as he did, Jack did not fully digest the philosophies.  He chose only that which tasted good, and then wolfed [sic] it down.  The tastiest morsel . . . ." (48).  Unfortunately, I was stuck with the tab, and here's my tip 
 I was expecting great things from this book since Peter Craig himself came from a Hollywood family.  I have to say that the first 100 pages were strong, but then it just seemed to drag on.  The book built up so much on  the meeting of the father and son that the ending was a true  disappointment 
 Big disappointment, more so because it was a gift. The first word we looked up wasn't in it! Bigger nuisance than help 
 To the point; The plot is boring, the herione is boring, the storyline and characters are not believable. Total waste of money. And a disgrace to a wonderful piece of american liturature. I am willing to read a parody, spin off, or background story based off of Mitchell's GWTW. However, Ms. Randal did a poor job and wasted good paper on this flop. She could have made this story MUCH better.  
 Max Brooks has written a must-have history for Romero (or just Zombie) fans every where.  Unfortunately, while the story starts off strong, it soon dribbles into a series of disjointed and, occasionally, pointless vignettes.  It would be a difficult tale for anyone to carry, given the format that Brooks has chosen to use: a large number of first person accounts of the near take over of the world by the stumbling zombie hordes.  There's no single narrative string for the audience to follow and no heroes with which the reader can identify.  I found myself eventually becoming bored with the different ways that Max's characters described the zombies - there's only so many ways to say "undead."    To make up for the essential sameness of the story line in every individual short story, Max begins to increasingly rely on overblown rhetoric.  For example, a chain-smoking military veteran, recovering in a psychiatric ward, breaks out of semi-literate street-slang to describe zombie heads popping like "Kristal corks." Far from being effectively descriptive, it becomes a distraction that made me start looking for more examples of excessive hyperbole.    I think the book would have held up better if, in addition to the large number of independent accounts, Max had found a way to weave a single unifying thread, giving his audience some one to root for and a reason to keep reading. A difficult, but not impossible task and Max Brooks appears to have the talent needed to pull such a task off; but the lack of heroes, or even characters most readers can identify with, makes this a book with no compelling reason to finish.  You can stop on one page, flip at random through the book, start reading again and never feel like you've lost your place.  And speaking of heroes - this is really a minor complaint, but once you've figured it out it begins to annoy - Max's characters are all of a type: a PC type.    That is, such heroes as the various stories allow, are divided into sympathetic and non-sympathetic groupings.  The sympathetic, most effective, characters are all minorities, women, or handicapped.  The non-sympathetic, least effective, characters are all white and male.  His bias goes so far that there's not a single heroic cop, survivalist NRA member, or even effective military unit.  The president of the United States (sympathetic-minority) is contrasted against the vice-president (unsympathetic-white) by citing many instances of the great president's wise guidance, while the vice president is simply described as "the wacko."    I'm not saying that it's impossible for the world to be saved by any particular group.  It's Max's book and he can take the tale where ever he wants.  But it's so transparently obvious a bias that, once you figure it out, you find yourself mentally forecasting the characters entirely independently of their stories.  It's a stretch and distracts from what could have been a more balanced (and more interesting) tale as a result.  All that said, I started out by saying that tome is a "must-have" for Romero loving Dead-heads like me and I stand by that statement. For all it's rambling plot and hyper-kinetic speech, it's still the best new installment in the zombie pantheon for many a day.  I predict great success in it's admittedly limited demographic.  
 I went to get the swiffer sweeper vac and ended up buying this. I thought wow, what a good idea. You can vac and mop with one product. NO WAY it does not work! I filled up the tank and when I placed it on the mop the whole tank spilled out. Ok, I thought it was just my fault so I did it again. Same thing. When I finally got some of the water to stay in the tank, I mopped. Oh my, terrible.....the water gets into the vac canister, and all it does is push around the dirt. It streaks badly and that cloth you get with it doesn't come clean. The only positive is the way it vacs stuff up, but it is not worth keeping it for just that. I am taking it back, after everything DRIES. 
 After my older brother suddenly died of coronary artery disease at age 40 due to genetically high cholesterol, I needed to learn everything possible on the subject so that I could avoid suffering the same fate.  I read all the books on the shelf, among them Dr. Ornish's.  I disliked this book because it is rather narcissistic and is focused more on Dr. Ornish himself than on educating us about how to avoid heart disease.  Take a look at chapter 1 and you'll see what I mean: "I was trained to treat hypertension..."; "I first became interested in conducting research on heart disease in 1975..."; "I began to wonder..."; "I went to the medical library and began reading extensively"; "It seemed like an exciting opportunity, so in 1977 I decided to take a year off..."; "I hadn't had enough clinical experience to be jaded..."; "I was unwittingly giving many of them hope for the first time since their illness had been diagnosed"; "I went back to medical school and graduated in 1980"; "From 1981 to 1984, I completed my internship and medical residency in Boston."; "In July 1984, I moved to San Francisco..."  This is just the tedious first six pages.  Trust me, it goes on and on like this.  Do you want to learn about how the heart works?  You'll finally get a few sentences on that subject when you get to page 42, squeezed in between more "I did this and I did that."  You'll get a little info on LDL and HDL when you get to page 51.  Sure, there is useful information within the 672 pages of this book, but you'll be forced to become an expert on Dr. Ornish and his life story to find it.  And remember, this book is more than 15 years old.  Perhaps back in 1990 he needed to devote 300 pages to convincing people that he was correct in believing that diet, exercise, and stress affect your risk of heart disease, but that that is common knowledge and not controversial now.  The research is far more advanced in today's world.  If you are interested in Dr. Ornish personally and the history of the study of heart disease in the 1970s and 1980s, you'll probably enjoy this book.  But if you are serious about educating yourself on heart disease and how best to avoid it, I would recommend Dr. Robert Superko's "Before the Heart Attacks : A Revolutionary Approach to Detecting, Preventing, and Even Reversing Heart Disease" (2003) or Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz's "The Expert Guide to Beating Heart Disease: What You Absolutely Must Know" (2005).  These books are more up to date and provide far more useful information. 
 This movie was disappointing and had a dumb ending 
 I find Podhoretz to be a pitiable unimpressive individual, a bitter pathetic old man. He recently stated on Fresh Air with Terry Gross that he has no friends who disagree with him. He lamented this as if to blame it on others stating that politics are the new religion and this is why the polarization in this country exists as it does. If for no other reason it is for the cavalier disregard he expresses for human life. One cannot find intolerance unless one is himself intolerant. I have many people who call me friend whom I disagree with on political issues.   Podhoretz and those who embrace the sick and twisted vision of "neoconservativism" are themselves more dangerous and fanatical than those they are seeking to defeat. If Podhoretz and his fellow neocons are what America has become than America must surely fail, in Iraq and elsewhere. They have debased and perverted what they claim they are seeking to defend. There is nothing noble in the unenlightened neoconservative vision of American hegemony.  No one in America has learned any lessons from the events of Sept 11, 2001 because no one has as yet examined the genuine cause for the behavior of terrorists. The past half century of American foreign policy has been one of nothing but blatant hypocrisy.   I wouldn't gratify the perpetrator of these insane ramblings by giving him any money for this or anything else he or any of his fellow conspirators have written and neither should anyone else. 
 No matter how detailed and informative the research done here by Cohn- Sherbok the conclusion he draws is in total contradiction with Judaism.  It is true that we live in an age in which every possible combination of thing imaginable is considered valid and authentic reality. But Judaism survived for generations in spite of persistent efforts of those who believed Jesus the Messiah , to convert or destroy them. This historical record, including the record of Jewish martydom through the Ages in resisting forced conversion is made a mockery of by those who claim that they are both Jewish and Christian in religion.  As I understand it those people who are born Jews and convert to Christianity are not simply free individuals exercising their personal prerogative- they are traitors to their own people's history, and faith.  To be Jewish historically is to deny that one is a Christian.  Cohn- Sherbok in advocating otherwise does the Jewish people who are in deep demographic crisis a real disservice. This when there are over two billion Christians in the world( By far the world's largest faith) and the Jews have not even come close to coming back to the numbers they had at the eve of the Second World War.  
 I am studying anthropological courses in the university and bought the encyclopedia to help and guide me through the new terms I encountered. For these purposes I found this book extremely unhelpful. This is definitely not a book for students, those who start studying anthropology, but rather for those who already know a lot about the science.  For example, here is the definition of essentialism:  "Essentialism commonly appears as both a violation of anthropological relativism and one of the besetting conceptual sins of anthropology. Exemplified by such totalizing ideologies as nationalims and biological determinism, it is also frequently conflated with reification, objectivism and literalism". Etc.  For me in order to understand this definition, I need to read 3-4 page articles in the same encyclopedia about: relativism, biological determinism, objectivism, literalism. And even after that I don't think I will be able to understand what the authors wanted to say by this definition. And its the same almost about every other term or concept I was looking up.   Of course, if you are familiar with all these terms - it is easy, but then do you really need this encyclopedia.  A frustrating experience for me. This publication is collecting dust on a shelf now, and I turned to more popular publications, like "What is anthropology" (terms are explained in a much more accessible language), "Understanding social and cultural anthropology", etc. And... never underestimate wikipedia, the best for me as a student.  Would strongly not recommmend this book for students and whoever is starting to learn anthropology. Will advise it to my anthropology university professor with 20 years teaching experience, he may find it interesting.  Ma 
 CRIMSON MOON is about a werewolf who finally meets his match...wait, I mean his 'mate' in a woman with some supernatural abilities of her own.  He's a criminal, but a good one--Werewolf Robin Hood, if you will.  And her father is a target because of her father's indifference to the harmful effects of his business policies on the evironment (wholly unbelivable).  He wants to make her father pay; he also wants his daughter for a wife.  HE is Johnny Marshall also known as Sam Morgan.  SHE is Olivia Woodlock.  Together with this story is a subplot regarding a crazy business competitor of Olivia's father.  Apparently, this very disturbed villain has hatched a scheme to replace Olivia with another woman-whom he has kidnapped, molested and surgically altered against her will (to look like Olivia, of course).  Olivia spurned him, and he wants her all the more.  The story is thin and undeveloped, as are:  the romance, the lead characters, the villain.  The villain and environmental protection burglar/hero business are the weakest part of CRIMSON MOON.  Olivia loses her heart to Sam inside of 30 pages:  "...she couldn't shake the disturbing feeling that he had taken some part of her with him [I think she means her heart]...," though she had met him only moments before and talked with him for a few minutes, showing him some of her father's art collection.  Okaaaaay....  CRIMSON MOON is convoluted and suffers from a lack of depth of intellect or emotion.  If you are into excessive, inessential sex scenes then this flat, tall tale of a story from Rebecca York also known as Ruth Glick will be just the thing.     And if I haven't been clear enough, I have another way of putting it:  I started reading this book two months ago and only got about halfway through.  Last night I tried again (I like to finish books I've paid for...if I can), but I only made it about 10 pages further.  And that took a colossal effort!  If This Book Were Food, I'd Rather Starve Than Clean My Plate. 
 I ordered Desiring Italy to read while my husband and I travelled in Italy this year. I had hoped that it would be as interesting as The Italians by Luigi Barzini or Under the Tuscan Sun by Frances Mayes.  Unfortunately, I  was disappointed by the book; it did not meet my expectations or hold my  interest so I abandoned it in our hotel room 
 I set up everthing according to the Quick install. All setting is correct but i still could not print. I call Technical support,on hold for 20 minuts then told me he was not the right support agent. Back in the loop i go . wait for 30 more minutes 2nd agent told me the same thing. Don't waste your time calling thier support. if it work out of the box great if not return it don't waste ur life like i did 
 I just finished this book. While it paints an interesting picture about the process to bring a car to market, the style Walton employs falls short. I understand the strategy to be the naive narrator (learning with reader how things work), but she uses too many cliches and poor analogies to make her point. I don't know how many times she said "Ugly as sin" or even "It was, like," a few times. I'd recommend David Halberstam's The Reckoning or Comeback as well-written alternatives about the same subject, especially Comeback's depiction of the Mustang overhaul, than this book 
 The Magus, the French Lieutenants Woman and The Aristos rate in my top 20 if not top 10 of best books ever (even though I am no longer young enough to be the target audience for them). I tried to get through Daniel Martin twice, but get stuck in the slow plot, the dense, overly complex, writing and the pages of gowing nowhere. This is a big dissappointment and put me of other john Fowles novels for a while 
 I had hoped for an unbiased and dispassionate look at the lives of observant Chasidic women, but found this book to be little more than a rah-rah shout out for the Lubavictch way of life. 
 if you're into real trance such as paul van dyk or tiesto or any of those, dont buy this cd.. it's more like the pop music of trance.. i havent even heard the 2nd cd cuz of how pissed i was by the first but i hear its supposed to be a little better at leas 
 I accidentally discovered Larry the Cable Guy's humor one night flipping through the channels and laughed quite hard for the 5-10 minutes I saw him on stage talking about hunting.  Then my wife immediately recognized his voice and style as Mater (without the tuh) in Cars.  In fact, I still like watching Cars and am thankful to have a nephew to use as an excuse to do that.  In searching for some more of his humor I bought Git R Done.  It started funny enough, really picking out some redneck traits and playing on them. Then he started filling in with "that's funnier than ..." jokes with punch lines at the cost of the physically and mentally disadvantaged. Slowly he eased into an "If your in America, speak English!" rant because he could not get something at an Arby's. Before I knew it all he was producing was "humor" that relied on a racist discriminatory audience with little concern for the butt's of his joke.   At one point I suspected that the audience was the butt of his jokes. Although I did not take the time to see Borat, the critics tell a story of a scary audience that jumps onto Borat's very outdated bandwagon and cheers and jeers his racist xenophobic humor. Oddly, When Larry The Cable Guy began criticizing the Dixie Chicks for slamming Bush and Toby Keith it suddenly resounded in an in your face humor along the lines: Toby Keith knows how ignorant his audience is and you can't blame the guy for playing down to their level to earn a buck.  Perhaps that was Larry's idea as well: play down at the audience's level to earn a buck. After all, there were about three times that he suddenly lost his drawl and made me think he ain't from the south at all. Hmmm.  On the other hand, I hope it scared him to hear and see how hearty and full his audience laughed at racist jokes that should have died no later than with segregation. On the other hand, he flashed his "Confederate Flag" guitar immediately when walking out on stage and willingly proved he doesn't know how to play it at the end of his set. Was he playing down to the audience or bringing the audience down to his?   Worse, how can I watch a kid's movie like Cars again without thinking of a racist entertainer behind that beat up ole wrecker. For that matter, how can Pixar still be proud of it?  
 I kept turning the pages looking for help in my addiction.  But, every story written, or explaination given seemed to place the root of the blame on relationships with ones mother.  I didn't find this to be a constructive way of looking at the problem, or finding a solution 
 Unfortunately, I never got to use it as the iPod would not charge. Looked very cute, but never got to use it...Returning for a refund.. 
 Well, before buying this I had never even heard of bright eyes.  Just so you know my background, I generally dislike indie and Emo.  I usually listen to hardcore and Screamo.  But for some reason I became interested in this band.  (or person) Someone compared a CD of their's to A Death Cab CD.  Me being a pretty big Death Cab fan, I decided to go out and buy this EP to see if I liked this band at all.  This review is the result of that listen.  The EP opens up with the slow acoustic guitar picks of "a line allows prgress"...  A few seconds into the song I am greeted with with drums and an organ.  This song sounds like a slower Cursive song.  The guy's voice sounds decent.  I guess the vocal effects he uses are for emotional purposes.  Overall this is a pretty decent song.  It reminds me of hotel california.  Next in line comes one of my favorite tracks on here:  "a perfect sonnet".  I don't know if it's the simple guitar stum or the sense that his voice is going to explode any moment.  Seriously, the whole song I was thinking that everything was about to fall apart...but it didn't.  He keeps going and going.  It must be his voice that creates this mood.  This was also the point of the CD where I realized that it was a bit more than music I was listening to.  Bright eyes will make you feel moods that other music can't.  It's got a unique brand of emotion that is new to me.  It's too bad this song ends so quickly.  As I press on to: "on my way to work" I begin to get the feel for the CD.  He's almost whispering on this track.  There's an odd sounding guitar picking and a country sounding synthesizer.  Quite frankly, I hate this song.  It sounds like an offkey country ballad...  Who wants that?  The next two tracks are more or less the same feel.  A new arrangement provides better quality music than the craptastic on my way to work, but doesn't reach the level of A perfect sonnet.  Finally, the EP is ended with the techno atmospheric: Neely o hara...  I don't know what to say.  It's meaningless.  I don't see how you can like this.  It's just pointless.  Overall this is a half and half EP.  The first two tracks are good...  But the rest of the CD falls between failing and decent.  If Bright Eyes good churn out more tracks like a perfect sonnet, this band would get at least a 4 star.  Sadly thats not the case.  So I don't recommend this for anyone other than the really dedicated fans.  Perhaps the other CD's are better 
 While Dr. Osterholm's suggestions for improvements to the nations biological defense were ingenious and visionary, the rest of the text was to sensational for me to take seriously.  The examples of biological attacks were so dramatic that at points I was laughing.  The terrorists had some how bypassed all safeties in place without any effort which would not be the case for a large scale attack.  Just read "Silent Death" or "Biohazard" and you would understand the difficulty in the types of attacks he was describing. Yes, there have been bioterrorist attacks in the U.S. but none of the scale he is describing.  He doesnt seem to understand the destinction between biological warfare and bioterrorism that he says he is trying to make.  There is a real threat and his underlying message is an important one but the approach was meant to shock instead of to teach. If your interested in biological weapons or warfare I would suggest "Germs" or "Biohazard" instead.  They take them selves more seriously and the detailed accounts of actual biological attacks is more frightening then anything that can be made up 
 I love the Walk Away the Pounds series but this one has to be my list favorite.  It's hard to follow and it just seems sparatic to me 
 "Possessed" is an unconvincing portrayal of an exorcism that apparently occurred some years ago and was the basis for the classic and seminal demonic possession movie known as "The Exorcist".  The acting is very poor in this movie and the movie fails to deliver the goods.    The movie, "Possessed", lacks the substance, style and atmosphere necessary to make any kind of horror movie effective, especially one about possession.  The action in this movie comes off as artificial and lacking the essence of the horror associated with demonic possession.  By contrast, "The Exorcist" thrusts the viewer into the world of demonic possession and, as a result, the viewer becomes emersed in the story and can actually feel the horror and pain associated with this subject matter.  "Possessed" tackles a very difficult issue and does a very poor job of portraying demonic possession and exorcism.    In short, "Possessed" is lifeless and has no spirit which is necessary to present the horrors and trappings of demonic possession and exorcisms.  For good movies on demonic possession, I recommend "The Exorcist", "The Exorcist III", "Amityville II: The Possession" and "The Exorcism of Emily Rose", especially "The Exorcist" based on the novel by William Peter Blatty 
 I bought this DVD after watching Jessica Simpson's latest music video "These boots are made for walkin'". I thought her Reality Tour Live will have some catchy songs and video but was very disappointed. May be OK for those who just want to watch Jessica sing 
 This is one of the few books I have bought over the years that I wish I hadn't wasted my money on. I thought the story was kitschy and trite, as well as badly written. As a dog owner she demonstrated quite a degree of ignorance, naivity, and recklessness, and I think the new age twist to the story was just pathetic. All in all, I don't get why anyone found this worth publishing. 
 The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, "[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man".  But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.  There are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk writes, "What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises John Randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about Calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'.  Another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that, "state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice.  The third thread would be Kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition. `Prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority.  In order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. I found Russell Kirk's salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day. 
 The movie is a piece of art. One of my all time favorites. The Extended edition DVD is very badly compiled. The Bonus features are sub par with bad video quality. The alternate ending and beginning look like they are from a totally different film, and do not have the BI look and feel. Other special features are small and without much substance. The extended edition of the film itself is not spectacularly extended. It is not a director's cut (the DVD states this upfront in the opening credits) so it not fun to watch. Don't get this if you are looking for a LOTR style extended edition 
 I tried to install at my house with only 20 feet range but I was getting static noise.  Only way I could make it work was by disconnecting our 2.4GHz cordless telephone (Panasonic) unit.  I tried to contact the customer service but nobody are answering the phone.  I was on hold for 30 minutes twice and it was answered by a voice mailbox 
 It's a nice idea, but they are cheaply made and don't last very long.  In the space of 2 years, Brewstation number 3 has just quit working (doing what the other reviewer stated-just blinking on and off and you have to unplug it to reset it).  The first one was purchased new and lasted 13 months-1 month after the extended warranty I bought.  I figured it was just a fluke, and liked the design, so went out and bought another new one.  It lasted about 7 months before it checked out into that big coffeemaker station in the sky.  I wrote Hamilton Beach and was happy that they responded, and they had me cut off the plug and send it to them, and they sent me number 3.  That was about 7 months ago and now this one has percolated it's last.  So, instead of constantly replacing $10.00 broken decanters, I'm spending $50.00 to replace Brewstations.  Great idea, Hamilton Beach, cheap product.  I would pass.   
 Though I love his show, this book does not seem to have the outstanding qualities I expect from Jeff Smith.  You would be better advised to purchase his "Frugal Gourmet Cooks American".  THAT one is a treasure 
 This is a deeply flawed book. It purports to be a description of the characteristics and attitudes that make wealthy people wealthy, but it is based mostly on their self-assessments without comparison to a control group. I suspect that this heavily underplays the role of random chance in success, and attributes causation where there is only correlation. Further, the author displays clear biases on a number of topics, which leads him to engage in ad hoc interpretation of his data, sometimes to argue for conclusions that are contrary to the clear implications of the data--such as his arguments for the importance of religion in the lives of millionaires.  On pp. 33-35, the author looks at success factors, and compares to the role of luck on pp. 82-85, which he downplays in favor of discipline. While he touches on the importance of having the right connections (and the genetic contributions to intelligence), on p. 85 he asks "what does luck have to do with graduating from medical school? What does luck have to do with successfully running a medical practice? Very little, according to these physicians." But what does luck have to do with being born into a family and in a country where one has a chance to reach adulthood, let alone be able to attend a medical school? Quite a bit.  Unlike its predecessor, which looked at prodigious accumulators of wealth (PAWs) vs. under-accumulators of wealth (UAWs), this book focuses on millionaires (PAWs) and decamillionaires (a tiny subset of PAWs, those with net worth $10M or greater). The lack of comparison to the general public serves to limit the book's value.  A misleading comparison between businessmen and stockbrokers on pp. 76ff makes the point. Stanley states that the former is an occupation more likely to have higher net worth. But this comparison is misleading because he's only looking at the millionaire-plus sample; he is excluding more of the total business owner population from his sample than stockbrokers. The average and median income and net worth for business owners are likely lower than for stockbrokers. If he made the same comparison with actors or musicians to stockbrokers, for example, the problem is more obvious--by excluding all those who aren't worth $1M or more up front, you exclude the vast majority, and pull up the average. With stockbrokers, on the other hand, a higher percentage of them are in the top income earners and wealthy.  On p. 110, after having pages about the importance of ethics and advising "Never lie. Never tell one lie." (p. 55), he passes right over his example, Mr. Warren, lying about being a college graduate in order to get a job, without comment, and without noticing the hypocrisy.  On pp. 173-174, the author wants to make the point that prayer is important for millionaires dealing with stress, despite the fact that the majority of his surveyed population do not regularly pray. (He repeats this again on p. 370, saying "nearly one-half of the millionaires (47 percent) engaged in prayer. ... for a significant percentage of millionaires, their religious faith is a major force in their lives.")  In trying to emphasize the point (p. 174), he splits his sample into "religious millionaires" (RM) and "other millionaires" (OM), observes that 75% of RM engage in prayer while only 8% of OM do, and points out that this is "a ratio of more than nine to one." This is a meaningless comparison, however--RM make up only 37% of his total population of millionaires, so his "more than nine to one" ratio is really nothing more than saying, of those millionaires who are religious, three-fourths hold religious practices which involve regular prayer (and 8% of those who do not consider themselves religious pray anyway). Since the OM population is much larger than the RM population, in absolute numbers that's not a nine-to-one ratio--his numbers show that about 28% of his total sample are RM who pray, while 5% of his total sample are OM who pray--closer to a six-to-one ratio.  But more importantly, the author glosses over the fact that not only are the majority of millionaires not religious, even a quarter of those who are don't engage in regular prayer! Given that the U.S. is one of the most religious countries in the world, the fact that such a low percentage of millionaires are religious is quite interesting and worthy of further exploration as to the cause, but for Stanley, religion and prayer are an important foundation of the "millionaire mind," and he completely misses the opportunity to find an explanation for why millionaires are so much less religious than the general population.  In a later table in the book on p. 366, he shows activities engaged in by a sample of 733 millionaires during the preceding 30 days. The table includes 52% attending religious services, 47% praying, 37% attending religious events, 22% Bible/devotional reading. These numbers don't quite match up with the RM/OM data from pp. 173-174, which seem to show even lower levels of religious activity, but these are still lower than they are for the nonmillionaire population--and weekly church attendance is notoriously over-reported in surveys. Work by Mark Chaves, C. Kirk Hardaway, and P.L. Marler in the 1990s found the actual percentage of attendance about half of what surveys show. This actually could mean that millionaires attend more often, if Stanley's survey results don't have similar over-reporting.  The author's religious bias further leads him to recommend to a student going through a divorce that she, despite not being a church attendee, search for a mate by joining a church group (p. 268) because she "believed in marriage and the traditional family concept." He writes that "I believe that one is likely to find better prospects in a church setting than in singles bars. Of course, there are no guarantees, but people with a religious orientation are more prone to respect the principles espoused in the Good Book." But why is he just guessing on this? Hasn't he asked his population of millionaires--the ones who are 63% non-religious--how they met their mates? He did this, very usefully, regarding how millionaires purchase their homes (pp. 315-326)--yet isn't picking a partner even more important?      This book has some interesting data, and is at its best when giving comparative results between populations (e.g., the house-purchasing characteristics of economically productive millionaires vs. non-economically productive millionaires in chapter 7). But it doesn't stand up well in comparison to The Millionaire Next Door, which is a much better book 
 If you liked Michael Eric Dyson's other works then you will love this.  It is essentially his standard "blame Amerika" rant with the words New Orleans, and Hurricane Katrina thrown in to render the work germane.  The interesting thing about this book is how quickly it was published after Katrina.  Given the length of time required to get a manuscript onto bookshelves, I calculated that he must have written this in the two weeks following the storm. Given that some of the "facts" he cites about Katrina can be shown empirically to be false, perhaps he should have waited just a little longer before jumping into the fray.    Another  blow to Dyson's neo-Marxist take on Katrina is the  Knight Ridder news story released  in December (2006) that showed the pattern of death and to a certain extent destruction did NOT occure on racial/class lines as Dyson would have us believe also casts doubt on his narrative (for example, as a percentage of population, there was a stronger correlation between age and death than race and death. If those found dead in nursing homes were factored out, as a percentage of population, more white people than black died. Can we then surmise that George Bush hates old white people? The main stream media, with few exceptions, did not pick up on this story because like Dyson, they had already decided the Katrina narrative and they are not about to let the facts ruin a juicy story.)  Those of you who know Dyson's work of course will know that he was probably chomping at the bit from day one to throw his opinion into the mix.    Anyone who followed the coverage of Katrina probably heard various religious figures blaming the evil nature of New Orleans for incurring god's wrath.  Offensive as these views may be, I was surprised that Dyson - a writer who is considered to be a first rate accademic by many - would wast a whole chapter refuting such arguments.  In fact, by even arguing against these positions he is giving them more credence than they deserve.  If any book about Katrina is to be taken seriously, it probably should not contain a whole chapter on the pros and cons of various theological interpretations of the disaster.  True, the author is an ordained minister but perhaps he should leave his views on divine retribution in the pulpit where they belong (it is also ironic that given Dysons neo-Marxist critical approach to race, etc. that he would even counternance the notion of god. let alone engage in the arguments he does here.)  So, if you are a fan of Dyson's, buy this book - you will be neither disappointed nor challenged (because you already know what he is going to say.) If you are interested in the state of contemporary leftist "academic" thought then this is a good read because it is far more accessible than the works of many of Dyson's peers yet encapsulates the narrow race/class/power/gender optic through which they view capitalism in general and of course this most wicked of nations, Amerika. 
 This book really is controversial.  I would suggest more research and self education because some of the information provided is just not true!  It gives a neat perspective on things but not a book to use for diagnosis!  I would suggest supplemental reading if you are serious about your health.  I found a great report on Inner Health available at librarydepot.com  It includes a nutrition benefits chart that links nutritional support needed to many diseases/disorders 
 Yeah, I used to read Cubiclegirl.  I'm fairly certain I found her a good read, well, because I kept reading.  So, I read this book and it was sterile.  I had nobody to love or not love or even care about a tiny bit.    Were there words on these pages?  I can't remember.  Sterile 
 The Alex Cross series by James Patterson started out incredibly strong with a couple of excellent novels to the start the series in "Along Came a Spider" and "Kiss the Girls."  These novels were truly exceptional when it came to being edge of the seat thrillers, page turners, and plot twisters.  They were a standard by which I and many others judged other novels in this genre.  As the Cross series continued, the quality of the novels began to decline.  For one, Cross is supposed to be a detective.  However, as this series has progressed, he has done less and less detective work.  He usually just follows leads until he happens upon the villain, and then Cross is praised as a major hero.  Second, the plot twists, for which this series use to be famous for, have become very contrived.  Instead of that "I can't believe I didn't see that coming feeling," or "man, was I fooled" sensation, the plot twists frequently leave me saying, "that was absolutely ridiculous."  Many of these very flaws have found their way into "Londond Bridges."  This novel picks up where "Big Bad Wolf" left off.  Some sort of Russian mad man has created a criminal empire, is capable of unspeakable cruelty, and has more criminal plans to execute.  Cross, formerly of the Washington P.D. and now with the FBI, has been tasked with tracking down the Wolf.  This novel, like the others in the series, switches back from first to third person story telling.  When the chapters focus on Cross, they frequently are told in first person from Cross's point of view.  When other characters are central to the storytelling, then the narrative switches to third person.    This is not necessarily a bad thing, but in the later chapters, the third person omniscient narrator lies to the reader!  To be clear, the narrarator doesn't provide clues and lets the reader jump to their own conclusion.  The narrator deliberately tells the reader something that isn't so.  Then, the narrator attempts to turn this into a plot twist a few pages later.  This is extremely aggravating.  Many, if not most, of the plot twists in this novel just come off flat.  To a certain degeree, you are left asking "who cares?" or thinking to yourself "he couldn't possibly thought he got him this time."  The redeeming quality of this book is that Patterson doesn't pull punches.  Several monuments, buildings, and bridges throughout the world are targetted by the Wolf.  Don't expect last second rescues.  In addition, Cross's personal life has more and more problems thrown at it.  The resolution of those problems doesn't happen easily, but at least Pattrson doesn't let Cross off easily.  My opinion is that perhaps Patterson has spread himself a little too thin across all his projects.  He just posted in his blog that he has five, and maybe six, novels to come out next year.  It appears the focus needed to make a great Cross novel is lacking.  I've heard good things about "Mary, Mary," the next novel in the series, so I suspect I will pick that one up.  However, it is potentially my last Cross, if not Patterson, novel.  Overall:  2.5 star 
 This has to be one of the worse books I have ever read. It is so corny and unrealistic, and anyone that has to add animal cruelty into their story and think it is funny has issues. I do not recommend this book at all. This was a Kelly Ripa book club book, which does not surprise me 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 This book was drudgery to get through. It has got to be the worse thing I ever read. The only thing it stimulated was my gag reflex. If people see this book as some great work of art filled with profound truth then   we are all in trouble. I have never posted a book review here but I felt compelled to warn others to SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TIME. I only read it because it was chosen by my book club. 
 I'm of the opinion that King's books rarely translate well into movies, and this is no exception. Some of King's work is fantastic,  but unfortunately, a lot of it is simply tired old themes with nothing new. This falls into the latter category.  A novel about a novelist, and one who has a hard time finding inspiration: Please Mr. King, which college creative writing program did you steal this idea from? The writer's ideas showing up in real life: From whence do these fantastic ideas pour forth?  I won't bother to tell you the ending, because if you have the poor luck to watch the movie, you'll have already guessed it by the time you're half way through. It's all bad and hackneyed, from start to finish.  I will give Steven King credit for putting his fame to good use though. If anyone without Mr. King's fame and built-in fan base tried to sell a story this trite, their manuscript would never make it through the slush pile.   Maybe it takes a bunch of bad stories like this to turn out gems like the Gunslinger series, but it doesn't mean that we have to watch them 
 The 9 point plan is full of obvious things we already knew.  The 21 day plan means you have to cook every meal every day, and each meal has 4-6 items to make for it.  the rest of the book is filler.  I can't believe I bought into the hype and wasted my cash on this thing.  
 This book was a great disappointment to me.  The author has fallen into the trap of reading what she needs from her sources, whether they provide the evidence she wants or not.  I will admit I couldn't finish the first chapter and it may improve further along, but her rational for her conclusions escapes me.  The handwritten recipe books/journals/scrapbooks she studied could have provided a fascinating look at how women's lives and priorities have changed over the centuries, but her insistence on broad societal conclusions from these very personal documents left me cold.  When she directly discussed the documents and individuals she did a wonderful job, but when she tried to apply to the society at large their was a huge gap between her evidence and her conclusions 
 As I turned the pages I did not like any of the bag patterns so decided I did not want to own the book 
 No support or response to questions, only 1/2 of the functions work, not a bad design but it was obviously released full of bugs.  Try cosmic blobs 
 IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR RECORDS, I HAVE SPENT WELL OVER SEVERAL THOUSAND WITH YOUR COMPANY IN THE PAST YEAR, I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE THIS BOOK AND I WOULD LIKE AN ANSWER IMMEDIATELY.  TRULY YOURS,  BRIAN D. WHIT 
 Seriously, do waste your money. If you feel that the Harry Potter books could jeopardize your child's development as a Christian then go out and buy one before you child does and read or skim through the book and MAKE YOUR OWN decision.  I can't possibly understand why someone would need to get a book to tell them if the Harry potter series is good for--YOUR--children. This is something that should be your opinion. Not that of a writer, who in my opinion, is just trying to make some extra "Christian" money off some easily persuasive Christians.  I'm not going to sit here and tell that your crazy for thinking the--FICTIONAL--Harry Potter is evil and against gods words and is in line with Lucifer himself. I would like to point out that god gave us all brains to use and make decisions for ourselves. Don't let someone try to push their opinion on you, and definitely don't get book that is doing the same and making you pay for.   This book is just sad and makes me really question the Christian community.   In close I think the writer of this book is simply trying to make some extra cash off of those gullible and easily persuaded by other peoples opinions. Very "Christian" indeed. 
 These guys have to be the blueprint for all the hilarious cheesy songs the Southpark guys use on their TV show and in "Team America".  You can't find much rock n' roll music that is weaker than Nightranger.  And to think this is the greatest hits!  Horrible, horrible music.   Back in the 80's when everyone was listening to this instead of the Replacements it was laughable.  20 years later it's even more laughable and shocking.  The ONLY way anyone could enjoy this would be listening in a nostalgiac sense.  If you were 12 in 1985 
 While many of the details have been lost to time as well as the consumption of copious amounts of alcohol to numb the pain caused by the first 40 minutes or so of this celluloid nightmare, there is just enough in my memory to offer a carefully crafted, yet sharply vitriolic rebuke of this horror.   In my more than four decades on this planet, there is only one film that caused such a level of disbelief, disgust and abhorrence that I actually walked out of a theater halfway through its showing. It was a film so onerous, pointless and unfunny, that it stands in the pantheon of some of the most colossal wastes of time, money and talent in the history of Western Civilization. That film is "Cabin Boy."   To some, "Cabin Boy" may well serve as the cornerstone of an evening's entertainment, assuming the evening also features sock puppets and pirate hats made out of newspaper. Imagine watching someone pick at a zit for several hours then eat a sandwich. That's the kind of inventive, knee-slapping, laugh-out-loud fun you'll find in "Cabin Boy."    Having some respect for Chris Elliott's work on the old Letterman Show on NBC, I was profoundly disappointed by this unspeakably inept attempt at humor. If it doesn't induce deep REM sleep, "Cabin Boy" will surely leave you either angry or depressed. One would venture to guess these were not the results Elliott intended.   Letterman's genius-level cameo notwithstanding, "Cabin Boy" is about as funny as a prostate exam...without the "local" and the lube.   
 It's too bad this book is a mish mosh and that neophytes in Chinese medicine are not going to know this. Some of the material is very standard and authentic, but a lot of it is the authors' own invention. So be careful with this. If you want the real deal, this is not the book you want. A better introduction to standard Chinese medicine is Kaptchuk's classic, The Web That Has No Weaver 
 I was expecting accurate information regarding the history of Christmas songs and carols. Instead, Ace Collins has taken some facts about the carols and woven fairytales around them. In some cases he has taken a few facts and assumed results that are erroneous.   Having personally researched "Silent Night" in Austria, I can say for certain that Collins has presented another fanciful story based on some facts and some misconceptions about the world's best-loved carol.   The tale about "The Twelve Days of Christmas" being a secret catechism for Catholics in the period when they were oppressed in England doesn't make any sense. The "secret" Catholic beliefs it supposedly hides are identical to the Protestant beliefs of that era. Therefore there was no reason to keep them secret from Protestants -- 1 =  one God, 2 = Old and New Testament, 3 = gold, frankincense, and myrrh -- and so on.   Sadly, it's just another feel-good Christmas book when it could have been a valuable resource for people wanting accurate information.  
 I rented this movie because I really adore the two lead actors.  However, although they do the best they can, there is no saving this banal, movie of the week-esque movie.  There are a couple of nice moments, most notably when D'Onofrio's character talks about his father and about his love of football.  Other than that, the story seems to be cobbled together from many other "uplifting" movies.  At times, you can not only guess what will happen next, but can guess what the exact line will be.  Football hero becomes self-pitying after an accident leaves him blind (and unable to satisfy his cheap girlfriend in the sack--which she exposes in a tell-all book).  His tutor from school shows up, himself in a wheelchair, and pops this crazy idea to enter a whitewater rafting race.  Even though he professes to have it all together and is all rah-rah, he still feels his own sadness that his dreams of being a dentist were dashed by a drunk driver.  But first--you knew it!--they have to learn to trust each other.  This involves whacky stunts.  The two drive to the race, having adventures, learning about themselves and each other, suprising locals with can-do spirit.  Each scene seems to end with the two sharing a warm laugh in the fuzzy sunset.  Each person they run into is nutty.  And even though I said I liked this, the lines from the scene where Olee talks about his dad seem to practically be directly from "The Breakfast Club" where the jock talks emotionally about his dad.  Only the commitment of Hines and D'Onofrio keep this one from getting no stars at all.  So to recap: Person who's cocky and beloved for his physical prowess loses it and feels sorry for himself? Check. That person has one last chance to hear the chanting of the crowd and relive the glory? Check. Another person who's been down that same road of self-pity and redemption comes along to save him? Check. Two men bond on the road and endure colorful locals? Yup. Student becomes teacher? Yes. Locals try to keep them down? Check. Other dreamers lend a hand? Drunk driving? Boy stunted emotionally by father? Bathroom humor? Improbable competition set up to prove worth of the outsiders, and won to stirring music and cheers? All those who've been touched by the quest and who we've met along the way show up at the end? Suprise ending that is supposed to warm your heart and teach you what's really important?  Yes, yes, yes 
 In this book Popper presents two contradictory theses: (a) science can be based on deductive logic only, and there is no need for induction; (b) science cannot have a logical basis.   Because deduction yields sure knowledge if it is based on sure knowledge and induction always produces only hypothetical knowledge, as Bertrand Russell clearly stated, Popper begins by trying to show that the use of deduction instead of induction can provide a solid logical basis for science. He talks about replacing "inductivism" by "deductivism." In reality, he explains the use of deduction in the testing of a theory: consequences are deduced from the theory and are compared with known facts, which is something known by many. Induction, on the other hand, is used in creating hypotheses in both experimental and theoretical investigations and is again used in generalizing the results of tests (a) to all other possible tests in experimental investigation, and (b) also to some phenomena that cannot be used to test the theory created using the hypothesis, or hypotheses, that are produced inductively. When Popper claims that inductivism can be replaced by deductivism, he is unaware of the fact that induction is used at the beginning of both experimental and theoretical investigations to create hypotheses and again at the end of the investigation to generalize the test results.   But in the rest of the book, Popper concentrates on the generalization of test results, which is done through induction and is what he overlooked to begin with, as explained above. Consequently, Popper proves rightly that scientific knowledge cannot be produced using deductive logic, which is the opposite of what he tried to prove earlier.   The truth is that new knowledge is not a product of logic but is learned from the world about singular phenomena and is generalized through induction. Induction does not yield logically sure knowledge, but evolution created the human brain/mind so that it knows that it has to trust induction. Thus, everyone avoids hitting his or her head against hard objects by learning from past experience through induction. Someone who does not trust such inductive knowledge is punished severely. Similarly, when a scientist or an engineer does not use an accepted theory anywhere in his or her work, he or she is likely to be punished by failure and its consequences of many kinds.  Popper's views should serve to waken up those who seek the comfort of producing all knowledge through deduction only, but in fact, they shed doubt mostly on theories, because a theory is not deduced from anywhere, unlike empirical knowledge is, about some singular phenomena. A theory is constructed and tested by using induction or deduction, as necessary, at various stages of the total process on the basis of empirical knowledge. Popper's views are those of a philosopher who is not familiar with the mission and methods of science and thinks that science is about discovering something that can be called the absolute truth. Read also my evaluation of Kuhn's views.  Another erroneous idea of Popper is that theories can be falsified but cannot be verified. It is true that if a new theory is falsified by a few or even a single test, there is usually no more wish to keep testing it. But when an accepted theory is falsified by one phenomenon, it is not discarded as invalid. Its use continues where it gives good results. It is also true that a theory cannot be verified in an absolute sense, but this is true also about empirical knowledge. The generality of any knowledge is a consequence of induction which is forced upon the mind by the results of evolution, as mentioned. The verification of a theory, or any knowledge, means that it can be used where it gives useful results. Unfortunately, the impossibility of the logical or experimental validation of knowledge in a general way is seen as a weakness of only theories by those who ignore what a theory is and how it is constructed, tested, and used.  
 Too bad, the lowest rating is a "one" star....because I would have given it "0" stars.  Very disappointed and a complete waste of money and time.  I broke the cardinal rule, I bought the book on a 'whim' and didn't even open the book before purchase...my ERROR don't let it be yours!  I skimmed the book in less then 30 minutes, less I actually think, because there is NOTHING of value in it!  Terry Allen wrote strictly of his personal experiences, which were very one sided and lacked ANY substance.  For example, he states, he sold 100 worth of options to his family for $1 each, then sold the stock years later for $100,000 each.  Question is how!?  Why would anyone buy stock from members of his family for $100,000 each?  What did the investors get in return, what was the basis for the sale?  No information is given.  There is just a bunch of incomplete thoughts and ideas in this book.  Sad and totally disappointed with myself for spending any money but mostly disappointed to think that apparently anybody can write a book with absolutely no value in it and still get it published.  Did the publisher even read the book?  Did anyone?  Doubt it because it is a complete waste of paper and ink 
 I like the information about baby massage. But other than that??? This book made me feel like an utter failure as a new mother. My son doesn't fit in ANY of her categories for babies and I am with the other reviewers who don't agree with her dislike of 'attachment parenting'. I love my son and I relish every moment of my time with him. If cuddling him before he goes to sleep is bad, then I'll be 'bad'. I'm sorry, but this woman needs to get off her high horse and come to grips with reality. Babies aren't going to go to sleep by telling them, "I'm putting you down for a sleep. You know how much better you feel afterward." PLEASE! Don't waste your time with this book. 
 I will state that this monitor is very clear and has no interference BUT ours died after five months of just nighttime use and neither charger works...we tried plugging the monitors directly into the wall, charging for days at a time, and even searched endlessly for replacement batteries with no luck. I had ignored a review I read similar to the one I'm writing just before I purchased this imonitor, I learned my lesson!  Purchase with caution.    
 This product has a known defect for serial numbers R641 and less (see Logitech website). I just received my Amazon Order  and it was serial number R635. It will be sent back tomorrow. Hopefully, Amazon will cleanse its inventory on its own, rather than relying on its customer base 
 I really wanted to like this lantern. It is a nice size and is nicely made at a great price, but the light output is pathetic. The package gives the impression that there are 4 leds in it, but I find that doubtful. The light output is no better than the output from a tiny key fob Princeton Tec or Photon. In fact, I think you could read a map, or a book, play cards, or follow a trail, more easily with one of the tiny key fob lights. I'm returning mine. 
 There's a lot to like in this book, theoretically. The worlds themselves are well-drawn, the language curt and no-nonsense with occasional flights into a kind of hard cyberpunk beauty (that sort of mimics but doesn't really ever come close to the best that William Gibson has given us). The science is seamlessly integrated into the story, and you come away with the impression that a lot of thought went into its structure.  The theory doesn't hold, though. This just isn't a very good book.   The action follows three different characters, along three different threads. At first, and for most of the book, they have no obvious connection with each other. Their stories appear to unravel aimlessly, and although lots of stuff happens, none of it seems to be in the service of an actual story. It has the effect of three brutal picaresques without destinations, physical or moral.  There is a payoff, but it takes a long time to get there, and by the time I did I was so exhausted and dispirited by the intervening unpleasantness that it didn't really have much of an impact.  There are three major problems with this book:  Information withholding: I like books with central mysteries, that make you wait (and work) to understand what's going on. It's a good propulsive technique, plot-wise. But the mysteries need to resolve. The author keeps us confused pretty much the whole way through, dropping occasional hints that aren't so much tantalizing as frustrating. As I said: by the time I figured out what was going on, I'd stopped caring. This might just be my limitations as a reader, but I gather, from other reviews, that a lot of people feel the same way. You work so hard to understand what's going on that it's difficult to enjoy any of it.  Dreams: Harrison uses dreams both in the service of both theme and plot: to elucidate the characters' psychology, and to give us a window into their past. This is unfortunate, because (in my mind) dreams are lazy plot devices that give the author an excuse to stop the narrative and jump back for some convenient exposition, instead of wending it into the story. Generally speaking, as soon as I hit a dream sequence, I lose interest. I lost interest a lot in this book. Which is a shame, because the content of the dreams here is often wonderful, strange and sometimes even touching. It just needs to be presented better.  Unremitting dourness: There is nothing pleasant about reading this book. The main characters are either savage and unlikeable, pitiable and unlikeable, or mystifying and unlikeable. Often all three. And, with the exception of the wife (who I liked almost as much as I pitied), none of the supporting characters are much use either. The worlds they inhabit are brutal, dire, unpleasant, and dour. There's a lot of sex here, but as portrayed it's mostly just another kind of violence. The whole thing's kind of a downer, pretty much the whole way through, and the strange note of hope at the end comes off false and unconvincing, as if it's been grafted on from another, happier book.  The writing itself has some odd lapses too, given the care that went into the structure of the book, and the obvious attention to detail. Lots of tortured, passive sentences. A few bits of dialogue that sound like campy Chandler.   Harrison is obviously very talented. I wanted very much to like this book, and I suspect I'll pick up another one of his novels sometime in the future. There's a great deal of potential here. It's just that most of it went unrealized 
 I've read some Faulkner now, some required, most voluntarily, and still have yet to figure out what the fuss is about. Yes he can weave a story, but good grief, imagine the ego of a man who thinks he can turn out a story as incomprehensible as this. Right now I'm reading his bio by Jay Parini trying to decipher the Faulkner code.  I'll let you know if I do. I guess I've just read too much Flannery O'Conner (brilliant) and consider Faulkner a bit too precious. Slam me if you must. "A Light in August" was good, and I'm reading short stories that are wonderful, but please, present and future authors, try to engage the reader, not send him/her away frustrated 
 This is the second remake of the original French version from around 1970.  This one is the worst of the three.  The gags remind me of the Three Stooges movies.  They are overdone and drawn out to pad the movie to 90 minutes.  
 I love Mr. Koontz and have long read his novels...Watchers, Intensity, Odd Thomas and so on but this was dissappointing, not to mention just plain depressing. And come on with the corny slap-stick banter between the characters! Okay okay, we know the 9 year- old Leilani has a high IQ but REALLY! She speaks like a 50 year-old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence? These characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into. Therefore, I put it down after 350 pages of this twattle. Koontz has done much better in the past.  Lastly, let's keep dogs out of your next few novels, please? It's getting a bit old. How about a smart cat or raven for your next novel, maybe mixed with some more down-to-earth folks that speak like real people do? 
 I purchased 3 different Embassy purses last December.  None of them were the quality I had hoped for, and none were used as the gifts they were intended for.  In this case, the price should be a clue that the bags are cheaply made and not nearly as nice as they look in the pictures used.  I would not buy from this company again 
 This is a Grilling Cookbook. Not a book about grilling for dummies. I had never grilled before and this book goes off about sauces and marinades, when I just wanted to start by putting a slab of meat or a hot dog on the grill. Needless to say, I was lost and confused before I got the gas connected (which it doesn't help you with, either BTW).  It was totally useless for me 
 This book doesn't make any sense. It is so, so, so b-o-r-i-n-g. The book is not well written, and the sentences are way too short. I woudn't recommand this book to anyone 
 While the product is what I wanted, the shipping was too late.  The original shipping indicated that I should have received my pepper in time, but the shipper got the product to UPS late, therefore, I didn't get to use the pepper in the recipe and now I'll have to wait for another time to use it 
 I've enjoyed Stephen Fry's work as an actor and comedian, and looked forward to my first crack at one of his books. But "The Hippopotamus", while loaded with clever lines, completely failed as a novel for me because of the author's intense desire to shock the reader and thus "prove" his superiority. Fry apparently believes he has accomplished this with a plot involving bestiality, but he is unable to sustain the kind of intense focus it would take to really explore the dark world of mental delusion he temporarily assigns to one of his characters, an adolescent boy. By the end (SPOILER coming up; stop reading if you don't want to know), everything has reverted to a happy, sunny world. The boy who suffered the delusions has instantly forgotten them and, even more inexplicably, a complete cipher of a character has agreed to go on a date with the narrator, despite the fact that his idea of attracting a woman is to promise to "lick her like a lolly". Fry really gives away his underlying lack of grit when he equates a liking for McDonald's hamburgers with mental health. (Mickey D's advertising sure works well.)   It's too bad that Fry's goal of being shocking supersedes his interest in creating believable characters and situations, because he definitely has talent as a writer. His style is engaging and intelligent. I may try one of his other books, but I can't recommend this one 
 The author has a great topic and a great question, and does a wonderful job of not providing any straightforward substantiation for her assertions. Part ofd the problem is perhaps that "Has feminism changed  science?" is not the question Schiebinger seems to be asking so much  as "have *women* changed science?"  By Jove, they have.  But is  this a new story?  Save your $27.95 for later...  this book offers little  that is edifying or even interesting 
 I recently finished reading Nathaniel Philbrick's excellent book, "The Heart of the Sea, the story of the Whaleship Essex" and realized that Sena Naslund took a major chunk of her story from real-life events.  I suggest that readers of "Ahab's Wife" read Philbrick's book next--it is much more interesting and a truly fantastic read.  Naslund most certainly based the seafaring section of her novel upon this true story: the whaleship Essex  is stove by a white whale in the South Pacific. The men take refuge in whaleboats, and the captain is convinced by his mates to head to South America instead of Tahiti, out of fear of cannibalism, yet they eventually resort to cannibalism themselves.  I had to skim parts of Naslund's book, as it got so tedious in parts.  In contrast, Philbrick's book kept me riveted from start to finish 
 Hoffman's recipes sound delicious, but in fact are often flavorless. If you use her recipes, you WILL learn slow cooking tecniques (stacking meat in the pot, thickening sauces, etc). But after 7 years of using this book, my notes on the recipes have a continual refrain: "Needs more pizzaz"; "Add vegetables"; "Flavors need more depth". 
 I tried to play this movie in my DVD player and it wouldn't work.  After reading the reviews here I discovered that new Sony movies won't play on half the players in the US.  I am done buying Sony movies until this is fixed.  This is like the time they installed the virus on peoples computers when they bought a CD.  Hopefully, some lawyer can fix this.  I'll just have to buy movies somewhere else for now 
 I am a computer professional although new to Unix.  Also I am a "for Dummies" book fan in most instances, but this one is a waste of money.   Wading through all the cutsie remarks is annoying.  Furthermore, cute remarks take up space that should be devoted to more comprehensive text such as explanations and examples of Unix commands and concepts.   A previous reviewer suggested "Teach Yourself Unix in 24 Hours" and I took his suggestion, and am glad I did 
 I returned the book.  As I have a toaster over/rotisserie the book was not what I needed 
 That "gripper" feature basically just means the bags will be hard to fit onto your garbage can.  The bags seem to tear pretty easily, too 
 This book tries to link together everything in Stephen King's books.  Sometimes it tries too hard.  Like finding a character name from one book simply mentioned in another.  Not too mind-blowing.  Some of the interconnections were intersting, but overall nothing to write home (or a book) about 
 I could not finish the book because I felt as if I could not relate to her snobbery. Her life of privilege. I was only able to seriously read the first fifty pages then skimmed through it to be enlightened as many others  seem to have been.  I was not able to feel any of the emotions she  professed to have, smell or taste any of her food and ultimately, was not  moved by her writing. Could I have just been in a bad mood 
 I bought this book a year ago, mainly because of its high ratings. But I was disappointed. I read it once and I found the style of writing outdated and the content not so useful: many addresses where you should buy things, but how useful is that? I don't live nearby these places, and I want to learn WHY you should buy certain things so that I can decide for myself what is good to buy and what not. Such info is given only very briefly 
 I'm a little hesitant to write a review of this book as a male reader that does not gush with positive statements about it being an affirmation of the hardships women face (same would go if I were reviewing The Fear of Flying or A Room of One's Own, both of which are far superior to this outing, although of different genres), but I'll go ahead and write one anyways. Nafisi's account of her life and those of her female students during the past few troubling decades in Tehran didn't provide all of the insight that many have used to champion this work. Nor has she really provided any insights into the works that she uses nor many links between the relevance of these specific works with her students. I know I may get lambasted for saying so, but the memoir and literary criticism does not mesh together well and at no point do we get some semblance of true cohesion. Instead, we get pockets of reflections that come out slightly forced or too general. The layers of interpretation for a character such as Humbert is simplified to either he's a villian or a misunderstood villian, neither of which deals with many of the nuances Nabakov has included. You would expect more from someone who teaches these works if she wants to actually flesh out some of these ideas and the relevance and impact upon her students. The strongest parts of the text lie with her description of university life and the political complexities that emerge surrounding being a literature teacher educated in the West who comes back to Iran to teach. I think one of my problems was the way which the book is marketed as a celebration of sorts of the way literature is important within any context, yet the novel devolves into a simple description of the life of one brave English professor who stands up to the conservative regime and its attempts to curb access to certain books in the country. On a more stylistic level, I was slightly annoyed that the students she describes in the text, as much as she loves and cares for each of them and does try to differentiate them, actually become a massive blob without much indivuality. I had many problems picturing them and the way that they are different from one another. Her husband is also described more as a shadow than anythign else, even though he does play an important role, although a subtle one in many scenes. I think I expected a lot from this novel that I couldn't get from picking up a newspaper and I didn't get much beyond that. 
 This is an important notice to anyone who's purchased the Season One, Volume One DVD: http://dvd.ign.com/articles/648/648077p1.htm 
 Unfortunately, for all the name brand that this book conveys, I think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part.  There are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as McKinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales, boggles this readers mind.  The subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session.  No actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book, and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book, I would be astounded.  Save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation.  By the way, those giving 5 stars either can't read English very well or are shills for McKinsey 
 This is at best a good civic lesson for a grade school, freshman in High School class text.  No real employer would ever find this portfolio professional or useful.  It presents a lot of hype, fluff, and encourages the reader to overstate and exagerate his skills.  
 I bought this coffeemaker as a gift for my sister and was so embarrassed when she took it out of the box. First, the plastic top is extremely cheap and flimsy, and the whole thing broke off the first time we flipped it back. There was also a grey powder film over the whole appliance. Finally, it is just not good looking at all...extremely cheap in appearance. It did not even make it to the countertop before we had it back in the box and on its way back to Amazon. I went with the Bosch on their reputation for the greatest dishwashers. Evidently, another company designs and manufacturers their small appliances. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!! Get the Braun KF550-BK AromaDeluxe instead 
 Ms Howard is usually a dependable author but she really let her readers down with this one.  It's OK to expect a reader to suspend disbelief every now & again but one would have to have a frontal lobotomy to buy what she is selling in this one.  So disappointing, especially after her wonderful & hilarious "To Die For."  The trees (for paper) that gave up their lives for this book die for nothing this time.   
 starts off with an interesting premise about media influence and politcal power but turns into bush bashing anti-corperate rant.the problem with the media is bias, the problem with this film is the same bias 
 As far as crime dramas go, this is firmly mediocre.  The story is okay and requires suspension of disbelief only sporadically, but the author's writing style is sometimes a distraction.  Why do the African-American suspects always ask for Slice soda to drink?  And they repeatedly make a point of asking for Slice.  (Do they even make it anymore?  I thought it was replaced by Sierra Mist).   And another distracting detail is the author's way of giving so many people nicknames.  You don't need to tell me that a guy's name is Ed "Smiley" Jones if you never mention "Smiley" again or there's not something significant from a story perspective about that nickname.  That said, I liked the use of DC as the backdrop and if I was going on a plane ride, I would probably pick up another book by Pelecanos (but I wouldn't let anyone see what I was reading and then I'd leave it in the seatback when I deplaned) 
 I had been hoping for some more creative ideas. The book was fairly preachy about the need to combat global warming but since I was already concerned enough to buy the book I didn't need to be further convinced. Plus, the solutions the book proposed were so basic that unless energy conservation was a totally new concept to the reader there was nothing new. I was very disapointed and if it wasn't for the energy I would use in sending the book back I wouldn't have kept it 
 Neat book if you need to know what the leaves of a particular tree look like, but that's it.  There's no photos, only illustrations, and no illustrations of the shape of the tree or its height, just the leaves themselves.  It's a cute illustration job, but unless you need to know about the leaves, I would pass this one by, and even if you think you've narrowed down which tree it is by the leaves, how can be sure that it's the same tree if there are no illustrations of the trees themselves?  Probably a good book to sell in a gift shop to give a curious kid 
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 Not much to say about this item it sucks. very thin and cheap made. Does not seal at all and does not keep the bread freah This is the worst product i have every got from Amazon. 
 First of all I'm upset that I didn't have an option of awarding this disaster zero stars.  But that's another story.  I must be old-fashioned because in my day most vocalists could carry a tune and if they had instruments could play them at the very least with some degree of mediocrity.  The Raincoats are a total mess from the first note and beyond. Anyone who could give this music 5 stars must be brain dead.  I suspect that it's probably fashionable to jump on the bandwagon for a band (and I use the word very loosely) with absolutely no talent.  Getting a root canal with a pneumatic drill would be more entertaining.  Anyone buying this CD should be subject to intense psychotherapy.    
 You used to be able to depend on Woody Allen to make films that had at least a few clever bits, and some genuinely funny dialogue. Now though, it looks like the Depends are definitely on him. The baggy pants wardrobe choices aren't fooling anybody. If I want to see a leading man in diapers, I'll rent "Look who's Talking". Every movie from now on can only lessen the Allen legend. The one thing apparent from his recent films is that he has finally succeeded in surrounding himself with people that tell him only what they think he wants to hear. Any one who truly loved and cared for the man would save him this embarrassment by telling him the sad truth about his diminished skills. I wish he were my frien 
 Spend your money on one of Leary's performances, not this painfully unfunny waste of 90 minutes.  If you've ever watched a comedian struggle mightily to be funny and fail, you know the sort of discomfort I felt when watching these no-names flail on stage. It's telling that the only names of consequence--Stewart and Leary's cousin O'Brien--literally phoned it in. A typically awkward detail: the director cuts away to Keifer Sutherland reaction shots maybe a dozen times, like he's the President at the Lincoln Center Honors or something. It's utterly bizarre. Leary deserved better. I spent the whole time wishing I were watching him do standup--instead of watching him watch his inferiors. His brief closing remarks are amusing enough, but it's too little too late. 
 If you don't understand Russian and going to follow subtitles - this one is for you. The DVD quality is perfect (I'm not gonna say anything about the movie - lots of reviews here). But the fact that amazon said it is Russian but it turned out to be Chezh made me sad. 
 Being a big Funkdoobiest fan from back in the day my loyalty to this artist has been stretched over the years. Unfortunately its finally wore alittle bit thin. No question the first 2 Funkdoobiest albums were off the chain, the 3rd had alot of high points but also afew low points. However when the big man himself, Sondoobie (officially) went solo with his "funk superhero" album i was suprised by the hunger+bite he seemed to have got back. Sadly this album proves it may have been abit of an anti-climax. Where the last album was bolstered with strong production that allowed SON to rip sh*t, this time around the beats mostly sound synth based with weird keyboard samples. In addition SON's flow has fallen off abit too. Its literally like he's trying to rhyme every word in every sentence without actually saying anything interesting or entertaining. Although it was a very similar rhyme-style on the last Funkdoobiest and "funk superhero" albums at least he had a pletora of funny metaphors laced throughout his flow. They're sadly missing here. Apart from tracks like "wonderful world", "l.a.911", "confess", "doobie deluxe" and the brilliantly funky "dub sacks+blunt wraps" (which sounds straight outta his Funkdoobiest days) the album is a let down for his true fans. Practically every other song+chorus sounds the same. Hopefully next time round he'll come correct.           
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 I understood that The Moonstone is a classic so I decided to read this to be culturally literate. Well the story line may be interesting but the writing is atrocious. It is curricular, bloated, and seemingly pointless. The characters just keep rattling. A lot of writers fill in the story with descriptions of time and place to give an atmosphere to the story. This writer (Wilkie Collins) just fills it with unrelated trivia. Every once in a while I would go back a few pages to see what I must have missed. When I read again there was nothing there to miss. Ether Wilkie is extremely monotonous or other writing from this period is and I am just now lucky enough to find out. I talked to others about this and they said; "Now you know why Sherlock Holmes is so popular"   
 This is the most poorly written book I have read on the war.  I felt like I was reading a struggling wannabe writer.  I would have preferred to read to each person's story by chapter as opposed to being scattered through out the book. One minute Henderson was trying to write factual information, the next trying to be a novelist, she should have selected one style or the other. When I reached chapter 7 it was said that many military wives don't know the death notification process I quit reading the book.  I couldn't stand it anymore.  What I did read did not impress me or make me feel compassion for the wives.  I come from a military family and I am so grateful we are not like the folks in this book.  When you marry a Soldier that is exactly what you get and if you can't take the initiative to do research and educate yourself on the lifestyle then I have no sympathy. I do not care how much whining the wives do their deployed loved ones at war have it one thousand times worse than they do here at home and they need to get that 
 while i was watching this movie i thought to myself, "am i going to die?  have i gone to horrible movie hell?"  you see i was trapped in a theater.  it's like being tortured by some horrible nightmare but you can't leave cause B actors are pretending they can act just because they're fat.  the in crowd gives you that feeling like when it's grossly bright outside and it's a sunday afternoon and you're in a car and you've been sitting for 6 hours and you feel sweaty and there'a a football game playing on the am radio and you want to escape.  in conclusion, this movie turns me into melting snow.  but i suppose there are worse movies-- (see my review on gummo) 
 This is the worst novel I have ever read by Danielle Steel. If you enjoy spineless female characters and emotionally abusive, childish men then you may like this story. I only kept reading because I was hoping it would get better; unfortunately, it only got worse. I didn't even finish the last chapter. I skimmed it, hoping (in vain) that Kate would come to her senses. Instead, she continues to pine after a man who has admitted over and over again that she will never come first in his life. I have no idea what Danielle Steel was thinking with this one. I think I'll stick to her earlier works and toss this one in the trash 
    After reviewing this book I was very disappointed. The title should have been "just another picture book of a few guys bikes". The title "standard catalog" is very deceiving. The content does not even scratch the surface of the vast array of of bicycles built by Schwinn down thru the years. There are no charts of models built, no production numbers, no serial numbers, really nothing in the way of valuable information to the collector. Nothing more than pictures of a select few bicycles and some cheesy history thrown in for copy. Even my untrained eye spotted several inaccuracies in the pictures of the restored bicycles shown.    I will say that the photography is quite good and the paper quality is great. My "new" copy arrived with the binding separating and some pages coming out. This would make an excellant book to keep next to the commode in case of emergency!!!    Perhaps the next time the author decides to tackle such an undertaking, some amount of research would be in order instead of relying on the Schwinn name to sell a book. I'm not into burning books but this on comes close 
 This book was written by my father-in-law more than 100 years ago. He was a 1st Lt. in the U.S.Cavalry, serving in the Philippine Islands. It was written for the Army, and considered the finest book ever written on the subject of horses and horsemanship. It was recently re-published by the Long Rider's Guild in England. The Guild is composed of riders who have made a 1,000 mile journey on horseback. They believe it to be the best book written on horses and horsemanship. 
 I have read several of Hiaasen's books and loved them.  They were very funny.  This one is not.  It is an endless description of naked strippers.  I found the main character, Erin, to be very unappealing.  She is just so stupid.  Her problems are all of her own creation.  And she is not funny.  I think you have to be a man to like this book.  I, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring.  I kept waiting for it to get funny.  It never did 
 Me buy this book in hope of very short introduction to renaissance while me drink capuccino and eat sausage on train. I shouldn bothered. This book make my tummy very upset. The author very windy. He a windbag full of fury but soundin nuthin. I wish that I had cheese today instead of sausage. I would feel less sick after reading this book. Oh mama mia. 
 This would probably be a great book to read if you are in the habit of reading a few pages here and there and easily forget what is going on.  To read it a few chapters at a time is almost torture.  This book could have easily have been 50 pages if we weren't reminded every paragraph that Sasha is 9 years older than Liam and he is a wacky artist and his family pushed him away and he can't be controlled and she is so very successful...blah, blah, blah.  Historically, I have really enjoyed Danielle Steele's books but this is one to skip 
 On page after page of this book, Western Imperialism shines through. It's over, Mr. Bell. The Empire is no more! I could not bring myself to finish this book. I was that offended by the apparent xenophobia and the preposterous plot 
 A friend, knowing my interest in America's Presidents, brought me a copy of page 64, thinking I would be interested in it.  I was. . . in all of the errors!  I found at least 7 errors of fact on that one page about Vice-President Wheeler.  I know nothing of the rest of the book, and hope this is definitely advertised as fiction.  Even so, I would think a little more attention to historical facts would be worth the author's time. Del Hamble 
  I have not recieved this book and have ordered it twice. My review is that Amazon should not sell things they do not have and cannot get. I have been trying to read the series in order of printing 
 This book sucks..........Schwartz is impossible to read!  I tried to read The Living Energy Universe, and the Afterlife Experiments, which I could not finish....when a friend gave me the TRUTH to read I thought it would be lighter and more fun, but I was wrong, I could not finish it either.  Schwartz is definitely not a writer 
 I've had two of these stop working when used with olive oil, sadly, though the canola oil one is still going strong 
 it's a little confusing to use and it's very easy to stop the wrong timer running because it doesn't automatically switch to the time going off.  But the worst is it's whisper quiet.  I bought this item for a professional bakery and the noise level is high.  If your running your home mixer and the timer goes off unless your right by it you won't here a thing.     
 I was very disappointed when I ran across this book - although it looks like it has lots of really great and hard-to-find information, there are no sources credited for where the info came from, where the drawings are from or anything.  Sadly that makes it useless to me in pursuit of replication of authentic medival clothing.  If only the author had annotated it.. 
 To quote Matt Ruff in Sewer, Gas & Electric: Joan met Archie Kerrigan in November of '03 while researching a position paper on federal regulation of the genetic engineering industry.  Kerrigan was an Arkansas-born conservative, a tongue-in-cheek, right-wing iconoclast whose favorite sport was teaching stupid pet tricks to the hounds of the Lefty God.  He'd first gained notoriety after a correspondent to the Harvard Crimson accused him of "oppression symbolism" for flying a Confederate battle flag from his dorm room window. Progressive students mobilized quickly to express their outrage and demand the flag's removal only to be caught flatfooted when, at the height of their candlelight vigil, a passing political science major pointed out that Kerrigan's racist Confederate flag was actually a British Union Jack.  A photographer for National Review just happened to be on hand to catch the red-faced squirming that followed; Rolling Stone columnist P. J. O'Rourke joined in the heaping of ridicule a couple of weeks later with a piece titled "Bean Town's Culturally Illiterate Elite: Why Johnny Can't Tell Grits from a Crumpet."  Suspecting--a tad late--that they'd been set up, the flag-bashers reexamined the Crimson letter that had sparked their protest in the first place.  It was signed "A.K."  This bit of entrapment alone had earned Kerrigan a reserve spot in the lowest circle of Lefty Hades.  Hellbound or no, though, Archie was a crack biochemistry major with inside knowledge of the gene-splicing-for-profit business: he'd worked two summers for PhenoTech, a genetic engineering firm currently being sued by the city of Boston for gross criminal negligence.  Joan thought he would be a perfect background source--or devil's advocate--for her paper.  But when she went to look him up, she found the hallways outside his room jammed solid with angry women singing "We Shall Overcome."  "What blasphemy did he commit this time?" Joan asked.  "Andrea Dworkin," the song leader told her.  "Kerrigan's filed a complaint to block her from speaking on campus next week, and they say that he's threatening to do the same thing if Alice Walker tries to come in December."  "What kind of complaint?  How can he block someone from speaking at a university?"  "It's the new Sensitivity in Debate Ordinance that the Harvard Executive Student Council enacted in closed session last Thursday," a second singer chimed in.  "It bars students from hosting lecturers whose presence may create an overtly hostile environment for any ethnic, gender, physical challenge, or sexual orientation group, or other oppression category."  "Kerrigan," said a third singer, "is claiming that an appearance by Dworkin would create a hostile environment for white male heterosexuals."  "And what genius thought up this Sensitivity Ordinance in the first place?"  Joan asked.  "I did," the song leader said.  "It's an important step in the evolution of progressive society, but Kerrigan's action is a total subversion of the Ordinance's intent."  "Well, intent notwithstanding, if you got this beast enacted then Kerrigan is technically within his rights. Andrea Dworkin does create a hostile environment for white male heterosexuals; it's part of what makes her so interesting.  Of course a man who's read her essay on penile infibulation as street justice might not see it that way...."  "But the Ordinance is meant to safeguard tolerance by empowering students from oppressed groups.  White male students aren't oppressed."  "But if you make them the only group that can't censor hostile viewpoints, they are oppressed."  "Look," the song leader said, "you obviously just don't get it.  If any group can veto speakers they find threatening, even speakers with the correct point of view, then pretty soon there won't be any speakers left at all.  That sort of indiscriminate use of the Ordinance renders it worthless."  "We might even have to repeal it," the second singer added.  "By the way," said the third singer, jabbing an incisor-manicured finger at the rectangular bulge in Joan's hip pocket, '"don't even think of smoking in here.  It's antisocial behavior and we won't stand for it. 
 I picked up, Sheldon Cashdan's The Witch Must Die: The Hidden Meaning of Fairy Tales because I had an idea for a fairy tale inspired short story and wanted to do a little bit of research. I gleaned a few insights from the pages of the book, but mostly found it did not live up to all my expectations. The book is classified as pscyhology and Cashdan makes the case for fairy tales offering psychologists and patients insights into psychological problems. This was something I had a hard time swallowing, but then maybe this has something to do with my lack of conviction in pscyhology. There are a lot of fairy tales out there, and there's no way Cashdan could possibly be expected to offer a full analyzation of each one, but he does base his conclusions on a very small sampling of fairy tales, to the point that some of what was said seemed a bit repetitive. There was also far too much time discussing the movie versions, particularly the Disney versions of many of the stories. While a comparison of Disney movies to their original tales would make an excellent subject for a book, in The Witch Must Die it only serves to confuse the issue. So, I will continue with my fairy tale research. I have a volume containing the complete Brothers Grimm fairy tales which I intend to get to one of these days and a couple of weeks ago picked up a copy of Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales by Bruno Bettelheim, which Cashdan had referenced a few times, at a used book sale 
 I'm reviewing this only to average down the overall rating.  The album isn't worth commenting on.  It's that bad 
 This is not "Follies in Concert," it is the reader's digest version.  Many numbers have been truncated and many omitted, most notably "Waiting for the Boys Upstairs" and "The Road I Didn't Take."  While the concert itself ran over 130 minutes, the DVD is made from a 90 minute video tape.  Include the fact that they added about 30 minutes of rehearsal interviews, and the concert is basically cut in half.  In addition, the DVD is video tape quality and the sound is unstable.  All in all, a very disappointing recording for Sondheim lovers 
 I purchased this CD thinking I could play it for my students as part of a Black History music presentation.  Let's just say the sexual content of the CD prevents me from using it in that way.  Jill has a great voice and sense of style and I wish she would sing for the masses, not a limited population of listeners.  I was disappointed 
 If you are looking for a book that will teach you a lot about real estate and home inspections then this is not the book for you. The chapter information and text content of this book was very basic and did not teach me anything I didn't already learn from other books that were much better. Inspecting homes is something I have done for many years and I would not recommend this book to any customers or contractors. If you know absolutely nothing about real estate then you might learn a few things but not too much 
 SMALL MEMORY WHICH MEANS THAT U CAN ONLY PUT 1 SAVE ON IT SO U HAVE TO RUN BACK TO YOUR COMP EVERYTIME U WANNA SAVE!!! AND SOFTWARE IS VEERY CONFUSING!!! HORRIBLE BUY!!! I RETURNED THE PIECE OF JUNK!! 
 I look for Linda Howards books as soon as they come out but was dissapointed with this one.  An unbelievable plot can be entertaining but this story was to much.    
 The bulk of the information provided in this manual is easily learned through playing the game at the lower difficulty levels. There are few if any practical strategies discussed in any detail. It appears to be merely a collection and rewording of the descriptions of the Nations and their respective strengths and weaknesses.....The book is a waste of time... 
 It was, and remains, one singular sensation. A Chorus Line changed the face of American musical theater, with an urbane book by Nick Dante and James Kirkwood and sophisticated yet obvious lyrics and music by Ed Kleban and Marvin Hamlisch. The Pulitzer prize-winning musical has been resurrected in Broadway and on CD . . . And we can't wonder why. Those familiar with the original cast recording will cringe at the flatness of the "new" recording, a recording that's simultaneously intrusive on the memory and superfluous in any collection. Is this what Baayork Lee did for love 
 This is a poorly done album.  Buckethead jams on guitar and bass with a phenominal keyboardist and simple, methodical drummer on a bunch of tracks.  Likely done in one to two takes each with little or no mastering.  The tracks are then titled so that one would think the album had a point.  If you want a backlog of buckethead material, this album will give you that. He still is certainly no slouch on guitar and that will be shown on this album.  A bit more on the bluesy side than metal.  No speed metal at all.  I don't feel bad for owning it, but I wouldn't have bought it if I knew what was on it before hand.  Worth about five dollars.  Then I'd buy it 
 Restall's conclusions add nothing to what Tzvetan Todorov has already said in The Conquest of America-which Seven Myths gets wrong in its dismissal of Todorov's crucial point about the role of writing in the Conquest.  Merely being able to put information down on paper isn't the issue.  What Todorov means is much more complex, and is grounded in evidence from anthropology to neuroscience (e.g., Ong, Goody, Havelock, Panksepp).  First, with written words fixed in front of you, you can re-read, check for inconsistencies, compare to other accounts to assess accuracy and consider alternatives, even elaborate.  You, in fact, practice thinking skills you have little opportunity to develop unless literate.  Restall also sees no reason to prefer an alphabetic system over, say, Aztec pictographs that interpreters used to recall memorized speeches embodying the culture.  But only with an alphabet can you unambiguously set down every single thing a person can think; and only then can an idea be fully worked out and fully critiqued.  Evidence shows that the way you think when you internalize an alphabetic written language is significantly more abstract, analytical, and adaptable than when you rely primarily on speech.  Second, as Restall claims, "disease," "native disunity," "Spanish steel," and "the culture of war," are causes of the Aztec defeat, but, as Todorov rightly argues, they are only the immediate causes.  Underlying them is the ability to productively command signs (whether words or behaviors)-an ability that hinges on writing.  It's because the Spaniards had an extensive body of written knowledge that they had steel.  It's because of Corts' writing-based innovative thinking that he could exploit information about the "native" situation to win allies.  It's because of the Aztecs' speech-based tradition-dominated thinking that they didn't see the Spaniards as a dangerous new breed of enemy that needed to be dispatched-long before smallpox arrived with a later expedition-and didn't effectively adapt battle conventions to fight this new, unpredictable enemy.  Aztec society, as Todorov emphasizes, was NOT inferior to Spanish society in any absolute way.  The Aztecs clearly had a complex and highly successful culture.  But, at that moment in history, faced with a new kind of enemy shaped by written language, they did not successfully compete.  Restall uncritically dismisses Todorov's argument instead of getting it straight 
 This has always been a favorite film of mine.  The story is old-fashioned yet fun and the cast is divine.  Despite having the VHS, I wanted more and ordered the DVD.  Beware!  This DVD claims on its packaging to have Closed Captioning, but it does NOT!!  No subtitles in any language,  no line 21 captioning.  Nor does it have anything else.  "Interactive Menus" means scene selections.  This plain vanilla release doesn't even have a trailer. This film and cast deserves better and I see no reason Lion's Gate reissued this DVD with nothing added.    Since I bought it online, I can't return it and neither Lion's Gate nor Artisan will take it back despite the error in labeling and false advertising which is not the fault of the people I bought it from 
 A rather dated look at Japan's JET Programme. A few interesting facts and shallow gossip from the early days of the programme but nothing truly worthwile. 
 Well, Sufjan Stevens has done it again, that's the really sad part. In his quest to bring a uniquely angst-besotted perspective to all 50 states, Stevens has neatly sliced notch #2 into his belt.  Personally, I'm looking forward to Rhode Island.  
 This is a good book, but most are under the impression that Einstein actually CREATED the content of the book.  Einstein actually compiled the physics theories of the latest German and Italian physicists and wrote it as his entire theory.  For instance, e=mc^2 was not created by Einstein, as so many people people. An Italian physicist came up with it. If you don't believe me check any encyclopedia.  Einstein suceeded in taking everyone's work and compiling it. This was helpful to the world of physics.  Unfortunately, this stuff is outdated, and Autodynamics has disproven many things that Einstein says in this book. When it came out it was already outdated. This was published in the 60s. Autodynamics disproved what is in this book in the 40s (45 I believe). If this was published in the 20s or even the 30s, it would have been a good book 
 I was expecting this to be a book about the monastic experience, but instead, it is a book mostly about Kathleen Norris, her life, and her social theories. There are a few nuggets of wisdom sprinkled here and there, but not enough to justify reading all the surrounding dross. Worse, there is no humility in the book at all.   Instead of being a seeker of wisdom who went into religion and then wrote about her experience, Norris seems to be merely a writer with a gimmick of hanging out with monks and nuns to get a good book idea. If you like that sort of thing, you may like this book, but you should know what you're getting before you buy it.  There is a hard edge to Norris's writing, an underlying anger and vulgarity. For example: "[N]ow we sigh, discouraged, hearing only the seeds of our well-worn, ludicrous sexual double standard which dictates that women must be either virgins or whores, either blessed or cursed, while men are simply sexual athletes." And: "That we all begin inside a woman and must emerge from her body is something that the male theologians of the world's religions have yet to forgive us for."   She uses the f-word, apparently just to shock readers and listeners, as when she notes with self-congratulatory satisfaction that after one such use her driver appeared startled because "[S]he apparently had heard that I was a religious writer." Well, regrettably, I had heard that, too.   There is far too little introspection in this book. Norris too easily criticizes others while failing to look at herself and while rationalizing her own behavior. Perhaps I have been spoiled by reading Henri Nouwen, who seemed to always analyze the nature of his own feelings instead of criticizing someone else who may have brought those feelings about. But then again, Nouwen was a person of admirable humility, a quality Norris needs to work hard to develop.  Norris has plenty of personal issues to deal with, as do we all. This book would have been much better if she had spent more time honestly wrestling with these issues instead of commenting on externals, offering social criticism and justifying her life as "a poet. 
 opened the sealed DVD case and Get Shorty was inside and not the Usual Suspects.   I sent it back requesting a replacement and did not get a replacement.  I got a credit, I think.  Not sure.  I would rather just have the correct movie 
 This is the eleventh or twelvth Pratchett book I've read, and it is by far the worst.  That's somewhat misleading, though, because it's the only bad Pratchett book I've read at all.    I'm not australian, but I did catch on to many of the australian references.  The problem was that most of them weren't funny.  Pratchett's humor has always lain with the insight and subtlety with which he makes his cultural references and satire tie into the situation at hand.  However, in The Last Continent, there is no "situation at hand".  The story rambles on and on, seemingly without point.  People and things come and go without notice or reason, often simply to fit the motif of australian references.  The story of the wizards and the story of Rincewind don't converge until the very last pages of the book, and the convergence is not even explained (how rincewind knows to find the cave and then to draw in it).  The reason for Rincewind's problem is not explained at any stage (why the librarian changes shape, why the wizards' presence in the past is causing the present to shift at random, why it doesn't rain, etc).  The humor that does exist in the book is shallow in nearly every case.  Often it's just inane bickering between the wizards, which elicits cheap laughs, but doesn't grab one's attention.  The humor isn't structured at all, which is Pratchett's normal approach.  In his other books, the humor develops around some reference.  Here they are mostly just one liners.  In The Last Continent, the only time this kind of humor develops is on the topic the wizards' sexual repression, which is entirely unrelated to the story's problem.  I strongly recommend other Pratchett books such as Jingo, Small Gods, or Reaper Man for a much more sophisticated example of fantasy satire 
 Not very good...  tries to examine the social and institutional trends, but goes into much self-serving prose 
 Only reason I am giving two stars is i bought this on the premise i was going to learn about making wine with grapes which is popular in the New York/Ontario area where i live. The author is more in love with wine from fruit. I have to admit it intriqued me, but, I think the title should be Making Fruit wine or something like it. Out side of that good book on basic wine making tips, I learned alot, just not about making wine from grapes.  This is more of a book for apple wine or berry wine, than for Merlot or Cabernet... 
 I decided to give this book a chance, but wish I hadn't. The author has a hateful attitude toward animals that is simply offensive.  That, combined with his extreme cynicism, really prevented me from enjoying the book. Not recommended 
 This product seems to only design to last max 1 year as it will start to leak like crazy.  Luckily in Australia they offer 2 year warranty so I got it replaced. But I will not go back to this system, turn to the jug one instead 
 I bought this book because it was advertised as Bob Harpers book.  Needless to say, it's not.  It isn't Jillian Michaels book either.    The book is fun and there are lots of pictures of Bob, but no real weight loss advice that amounts to a program of any kind.  I like the book because I am a fan of the show and it does have some motivational anecdotes, but I wouldn't recommend it as a weight loss plan.  
 I feel really sorry for the student assistants that got credit in the front of Dobb's book for their careful editing.  This book has more typos in it than any thing I have ever seen.  And if Torts law was not hard enough to understand, having to work within Dobbs sorry typos makes it that  much harder.  Content wise, the book just does not lay out Torts in any  logical order.  It is just too hard from this book to pull out what the  rule is and whether a case represents the majority view or a minority.   Defense arguments against recovery tend to get far less coverage than the  plaintiff viewpoint: That much is obvious from the books' subtitle.   Overall, it is required that you use a study supplement with this book.  I  recommend "Understanding Torts" by Larry Levine, et al.  Don't  buy this book unless some sadistic professor is forcing you too 
 Anyone who objects to describing this mess as elevator muzak has no defense - the sad fact is that Gaucho is playing in elevators and restrooms around the world at this very moment!  Where to begin? The backup singing is absolutely atrocious, the piano tinkling so lame you find yourself swallowing hard to keep from vomiting, and the list goes on and on. Mark Knopfler was apparently in the studio for one song but the only evidence of it is the song credits. To top it off, this CD finally concludes the series of new liner notes by Becker and Fagen written for the re-mastered discs. Following the trend from the previous CDs, these notes are pretentious, uninformative, and too cute by several orders of magnitude.  Thanks to Aja and Gaucho, few in the late 80's or 90's bothered to wonder where Steely Dan had disappeared to - the concensus was that if this was all they had to offer then thanks for the first five albums and so long - it's been good to know ya 
 everything in this book is common sense.  There is really very little to learn from this, and it is overpriced 
 This is not a great book - pure and simple.  The author is chaotic in his exposition of the subject and time after time tries to come up with his own reinterpretation of the key concepts of Buddhism - apparently, in an attempt to look original.  Not recommended.  
 Read: "The Austrian-Jewish Mind". 95% of the men reviewed in this volume were Jews. Austria in the early 20th boils down to three strands of history: the fall of the Dual Monarchy, the Jews of Vienna -- and Austrians. You will not find anything about real Austrians in this book. 
 Indeed,there is a need for a continuation of regulated gun-control,in America.Yet,Michael Moore uses terrible examples to prove his point and humorously distorts the facts.Moore's end product does not justify the means.Eventhough Moore doesn't use a gun to kill ,he's the very essence of the "drive-by media".Why didn't he do a film on pukeheads who recklessly abuse their right to own a gun?-Answer-because that would give honest people the validation to bear arms. The people he points to ,in the film, who have done the shootings,are kids.After years of watching violent images,via videogames,and no parental control led them to that destructive behavior.Not the K-Mart availableness of the rifles and the bullets. The eschatological preachers of the elusive Doomsday,like David Karesch,do have a right to gun-ownership.But not for Holy War,against the American government and Pagan socialists alike.Now,Tim McVeigh's senseless bombing ,had more to do with his anti-social delusions ,rather than his true feelings about legal restrictions on unlimited gun-ownership.(If it wasn't for the song ,"Happiness is a Warm Gun", John Lennon may not have been shot by the maniacal subliminal Beatle listener,Mark David Chapman.) Charlton Heston supports ownership of hunting rifles,for sport and protection.The surprise Moore attack on Heston,was ridiculous.Like comparing apples to oranges.Moore shows himself as an opportunist,and not a gentleman.Dick Clark owns some music restaurant chain,where a black woman was directed to work at one.How is he to know,about her family members possessing guns or not?She broke the law,and Clark can not be held responsible for her domestic negligence.The careless woman's family promoted an un-healthy atmosphere for their dear children.Moore's subreptitious inferences are highly entertaining,but divert from the root cause of the lethal gun shootings,in America.   
 I hoped after the rotten ending in book 3 that this would give us some sort of hope for a sequel so that Will and Lyra could be together again someday and maybe have more adventures. No, sorry. Not a chance. This is just a shameless way of getting another 10 bucks off the dumb reader (me) who hoped there might be some way that Pullman was going to go back to the world in His Dark Materials. To call this a teaser would be flattery. The story is only about 60 or so pages and frankly, not very good. It's as though Pullman is no longer comfortable with the characters in the Dark Materials trilogy. Lyra is almost a different person entirely and at the end of this teeny volume I was asking myself what was the point? The book is supposed to make the reader feel like they've stumbled upon papers and documents out of another world, a postcard here, a newspaper clipping there, but it falls flat. Ah well, he got me again. I bought this hoping for more that a flat short story about a girl named Lyra who in no way resembles the spunky heroine of the Dark Materials trilogy. Luckily, I was able to return this so I'm not totally ripped off. It's just a shame, kind of like the ending to the trilogy. Buy with caution or check it out of the library 
 Regardless of the content of the book,  which might be well worth the purchase,  please note that Rashid N. Khan is founder and CEO of Ultimus  apparently a player in the BPM field.  Now the prior reviewer either didn't know that or perhaps found this irrelevant.  If the CEO of Ford professed to identify all the best in class for SUV's  you might anticipate he would be pointing out features found in his own product line even if sub-consciously, because if he believes in what he says.. he builds them that way.  (...)  His book may well provide his target market with information, I just choose to read from a disinterested 3rd party for this information.  "BPM the Third Wave" is a bit higher level look at BPM but they have no products to offer 
 I enjoy the genre of over the top gore comedy but this one didn't interest me.  The story was very slow paced and uninteresting with some pretty unimaginative gore.    It was also ridiculous and not in a comedic way but a 'that is stupid' way.  People are smashing through stone walls a lot.   The final 'ultra' gory finale really didn't interest me either.  Watch Troma's Terror Firmer or Citizen Toxie if you enjoy this type of movie.  Or wait for Poultrygeist which will probably be pretty Tromariffic.  I don't know when this was made but I would guess it has to be inspired by Troma.   I appreciate the effort but it didn't match let alone surpass Troma for gore comedy 
 The Best Of? A band has to actually have a hit that doesnt make your ears bleed before they can release a "Best Of" or "Greatest Hits" album, this of course, this band did not. 
 There was so much potential in this story, but unfortunately, the author did not have the ability to realize that potential. That in and of itself was so very sad. It's hard, at least for this Asian American reader, to sympathize with a self loathing Twinkie who, while supposedly so "American", cosmopolitan, and hip is so wretchedly naïve, even dumb. It's actually insulting for the author to try to have us believe a woman in her late twenties living in NYC is this clueless when it comes to people using her like her former roommate does in this story.  Also, choice moments to actually make some biting commentary about non Asian people's thoughts about Asian Americans never come to pass or erroneous ideas about Asian Americans, especially Asian American women are never fully challenged such as when a white photographer talks about how he likes Asian women because they are so "mysterious". You cannot help but roll your eyes at the predictable "torn between two cultures" and "not interested in Korean men" themes that run through this story. To be fair, some of the stories of racism do ring painfully true and some of the aspects of Korean American culture are familiar. However, the character's career in the fashion magazine industry is supposed to give the story a certain amount of glamour and excitement, yet the inherently shallow nature of the environment does nothing to give the character much depth nor does the author ever successfully develops any true depth in the main character or any of the characters in the entire story. Even the breakthroughs or nuggets of wisdom the character realizes toward the end of the story never seem genuine or profound. Rather, the realizations seem hurried and forced as the author realizes that the story is supposed to end soon.  This story does nothing to break new ground, challenge readers, or offer much in the way of commentary-which is the biggest shame of all because it could have done all of that. Asian Americans should support work by other Asian Americans. But we should support good work. Not derivative pap. 
 I read the bio She's Not There (by the same author) and it's fantasic! I loved the writing style and the way the story was told so I decided to see what else had been writen. Getting In looked cute so I gave it a chance. It's not a terrible book but it's not the kind of thing I made all my friends read either. If your looking for a great well written book I hightly recomment She's Not There instead. 
 It's hard to know where to begin when talking about this sensationalistic tabloid-like book.  On the one hand, not everything is a lie, exaggeration, urban legend, or told in a gleefully sensationalistic manner, and there are good pictures, but those aspects are really overwhelmed by how much of the book just isn't true.  It's uncertain just what propelled Kenneth Anger (who has a very fitting surname) to write this book; was it the fact he was bitter that his own Hollywood career never came to anything much, a general dislike of most of the stars from Hollywood's Golden Age, a love of sensational gossip in general, or something else?  He's a writer of the same caliber as an Albert Goldman or Geoffrey Giuliano and their own celebrity biographies--it's been shown that most of what they've written just isn't true and has no basis in factual evidence and has never been proven, so you have to doubt everything they write, even if some passages are true or written in a respectful manner.  He's like the boy who cried wolf.  Although amazingly quite a few people believe all of the stories in this book and they're now regularly discussed like they actually happened and are absolute fact, even though they're the results of speculation, urban legends that have been disproven yet just won't go away because of books like this, and are outright lies and character assassinations.  Just because I'm a fan of many of the celebrities from Old Hollywood doesn't mean I'm incapable of accepting that some of them did have less than perfect lives, personal scandals, and were the complete opposite of their screen personalities.  But by and large, with certain exceptions, the stars of that era were classy, keeping their personal and private lives separate.  Even if they did have, say, problems with alcohol, sleeping around, or drug abuse, they still presented positive public images and role models of class, grace, and style.  It wasn't like today, when people seem to know just about every detail of a celebrity's private life.  Does Anger somehow feel that celebrities of yore were more prone to scandal and devastating problems?  And why does anyone want to know some of these sleazy details, like about someone dying on the toilet?  Are we supposed to suddenly no longer like this person's body of work?  Even some celebrity biographies that do report events of this nature at least balance it out with just as much positive information and a respectful tone, instead of taking delight in tearing down reputations.  It would seem baffling as to why people now take some of these stories as accepted facts, no matter how many times they've been disproven, but again, it seems to be human nature to believe the bad and not the good.  
 The movie is great and as everyone here agrees - great and David Lynch fun but this disc is a shabby version. On some laptops, the only portion that plays is a short macrovision movie - yea, thanks. I finally discovered that VLC will play this disc correctly so NOTE, it may or may not play on your DVD machine correctly even though it claims to be a DVD.  Also note, Universal was too cheap to make chapter marks - there are movies on DVD from the 1920's with chapter marks - none here so if you miss the days of rewinding and fast forwarding like VHS - here ya go ... the resolution is also just a B - probably has something to do with the macrovision interfering with the picture quality.  So, great movie but SKIP this disc - wait for a better version if you can 
 I don't know why this book is rated so highly.  There's nothing wrong with the content (what little there is), but I feel that it's misrepresented as a book for intermediate level network programmers.  I was expecting discussion on when to use select() vs. multi-threaded vs. single-threaded servers, for example.  But this book is more for beginners (Tip #1, "Understand the difference between connectionless and connection-oriented protocols").    I also feel that the title is misleading.  I was expecting a book of specific tips on par with Scott Meyers' Effective C++/STL series which are vastly superior references on their own topics).  It's decent as a textbook, once you realize that's what this is.  But it's still pretty shallow, and definitely not worth the high price tag 
 I am interested in losing weight due to Type 2 Diabetes. This book is about emotions and feelings of overweight people. This is probably a good book if you have emotional issues. For me, it is simply BORING, and not at all what I thought it was. If it were not so inexpensive, I would return it 
 Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."  I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives.  
 Microsoft Office can be handy to have.  The files you can open, edit and create with it (most notably .doc, .xls, and .ppt) are probably the closest to universal compatibility among all your high quality options. It's (relatively) intuitive.  It has a pretty broad array of useful functions.  It's also obscenely expensive, considering the fact that you can get all of these things -- .doc, .xls, and .ppt; intuitive interface; and functionality -- for free.  I hunted up OpenOffice two years ago when I decided several hundred dollars was an insane price to pay for the ability to write papers, make basic presentations, or put together spreadsheets.  I was looking for basic functionality, but I was pleasantly surprised; OpenOffice does most of the neat tricks, too.  (Actually, it has a neat trick Microsoft can never replicate: it's open source, so it can respond to the needs of individual users.  You just say "Add this neat trick!"  and someone will likely be able to do it for you.)  It is possible that Microsoft Office has some killer feature you absolutely must have that OpenOffice doesn't.  But considering the price differential, I wouldn't splurge on this before checking.   
 I purchased this book based on the cover photo on your site---I especially wanted to make the little blue sweater with the panda bear and the darker blue one with the teddy bear on it. When I received the book it turns out that none of the sweaters in the photo you placed on the site are in the book! I cannot return it because there are no returns on pattern books! VERY DISAPPOINTING! 
 'Buddhism Without Beliefs' represents, some would argue, a radical existential view of Buddhism:  There is no true reality--only my experience.  If we accept this, Batchelor calls on us to dump rebirth and karma, since we have no experience of them, so that we are faced with an  "existential, therapeutic and liberating agnosticism."  But this is only playing with words.  Batchelor is really marketing a radical acceptance of one's ignorance and suffering which, in effect, turns Buddhism on its head. 
 While sometimes this works well, I'm frequently woken up in the middle of the night to static that wasn't there when I went to bed.  It doesn't matter what channel it's on.  I also get a random drumroll sound frequently.   If you like being woken up in the middle of the night because your monitor is a piece of crap, then I highly recommend this 
 Contains nothing but very abstract mathematical concepts and formula derivations that would only be of interest to scientists.  This book offer NO examples or PRACTICAL insight on how fiber systems actually work.  Useless 
 The release of films such as these by Fox can do nothing but bury L and H. All of their 40s films are awful and it's a shame that that this wonderful duo will be judged by films like these.  To see why these classic comics were so loved you must just hope that their silent 2 reelers will someday be rereleased. Only then will you be able to really enjoy these two geniuses and see see why L and H are ranked up there with Chaplin, Lloyd and Keaton.   These two warm and wonderful men don't deserve this -  and neither do you.  
 As a professional photographer, I found this book extremely disappointing. I purchased it because of the 'good' rating reviews I read under its title and the one good photograph which is on the cover. His lighting is terrible and his 'point of focus' using a macro lens, along with the compositions, make absolutely no sense. The only thing I would use this book for is to lecture on 'how not to do macro photography' 
 I agree with a previous reviewer who titled his review: "Mulisch, Pedant... writes a book."  Pedant seems the perfect term.  It is a collection of ideas that are thrown together, but not developed.  730 pages of time that I will never have back.  Not only was the book pretentious, it was also poorly written.  Perhaps the translation is to blame, as I read it in English.  Whatever the source, the (English) text was choppy, un-inventive, repetitive, and cliché.  Mulisch's overuse of similes is nauseating.  The dialogue was also suspect.  Instead of realistic, it seemed more the types of smart retort one thinks of only after an argument has concluded.  I'm at a loss as to what other reviewers see in this book.  Hopefully it works better in the original Danish.  Maybe it was just the wrong book at the wrong time for me, and I have missed the message.  However, now I am reading Orwell as a sort of antidote - and it feels a whole lot better.  I would suggest that you skip straight to that if you are looking for literature.  (Kidding about the Danish thing, by the way. 
 I'm sorry, but Pink and Say is a nightmare!  Although in the guise of a picture book, Pink and Say is a violent and shocking story which most adults would find highly distrubing.  The book includes, among other things, the murder of Pink's mother, the hanging of Pink and the wasting away of Say in a prisoner of war camp.  Plainly said, the book is completely inappropriate for grades K-4.  If this book is being read to your K-4 grade children, you should speak with your school's principal and put a stop to it!  And you should consider doing the same if it's being read to your 5-6 grade children.  This is not a children's book, period.  
 I bought this CD already familiar with the Dance/Trance/Techno scene for years, listened to a few times and never picked it up again. I picked up this CD since it had Tilt's - I Dream (Resurection Remix) - (which is the only track that carries a captivating beat - truly awesome) thinking that the rest of the CD would be just as incredible. Unless your gonna get sloshed or shoot up on something and freak dance to strobe lights amist a booming sound system, don't waste your money on this one. Until I personally decide to do this myself, only then would I rate this a five. Sasha must have better mixes out there that I have not yet discovered, but whatever the case, this CD is a disappointment. Rather than letting this CD uselessly spin in my CD deck, I simply use it as a coaster. I know many will disagree with this review but given the fact that I gave this CD an honest shot, I not writing this as a hater. I simply have not been impressed with this one. This mix carries the same monotonous beat from start to finish. Honestly, there has to be better mixes out there by Sasha... But don't waste your ears on this one.  If you liked other CDs like: Trance Mix USA, BT - Movement In Still Life, ATB - Dj In The Mix, Crystal Method - Vegas & Community Service, any mixes by Dj Micro, Tansport by Paul Oakenfold, Dj Tiesto's In Search of Sunrise, or any Gatecrasher Mix.... This CD may not be the one for you 
 I am a HUGE Laymon fan and it pains me to give anything bearing his name one star. But in the midst of all the gaudy sex (which comprises the bulk of the novel), and the tiresome use of "Christ" as a swear on every page, I found I kept asking myself if Laymon had even written this book. This is not one of his better novels in my opinion. It's not scary, it's not creepy, it's just vulgar. The mummy plot was a good one, but there were too many other plots mixed in which watered it down, and by the end of the novel I didn't care anymore. There were new characters being introduced and killed off too far into the book (like chapter 45). All of the sub-plots (if we may call them that) tied together in the end rather messily and, for me, didn't make much sense. I had no idea what any of those people really had to do with the mummy at all. Those extra plots could've been taken out of To Wake the Dead and made into separate novels - that would've been better. I love Richard Laymon's writing, but I had to force myself to finish this book, I hate to say. If you want prime Laymon check out Madman Stan from Cemetery Dance Publications (cemeterydance.com), or, for prime Laymon at a cheaper price check out In the Dark or Blood Games. Anything before this book will do. 
 I purchased this book based on its glowing reviews -- hoping to use it as part of my grammar lessons with my children who are homeschooled.  Needless to say, I was disappointed.  It is not a grammar book for children.  The subject content of some of the sentences were not appropriate and I found that it only deals with business situations, it is not a classroom textbook.   In my personal opinion, it is not homeschool grammar material 
 this book in short, did not meet my expectations. I thought it would have much better pictures of the beautiful costumes. you think of this beautiful movie and how much of M.A's life was centered around clothing. I was expecting close-ups of the amazing craftsmanship on the costumes, and sketches (which there are none). instead, I was deliverd Kirstin Dunst's high school year book, with tiny, grainy pictures of her big powdered hair. 
 I have always bought and liked Uniden phones.  Tried this one based on Consumer Reports recommendation and because I wanted caller ID.  AWFUL reception - too much background noise and you cannot hear the person on the other line.  Turn the volume to high and you get feedback from your own voice.  Good range (which is useful in finding the perfectly quite place in your house to finish your call!).  Stay clear!!!!!! 
 Not exactly the "vaults" blowing open, as stated in the promo.  These are mostly leftovers and one-offs from the late 1990s, when the group was on hiatus from serious recording.  That's why the set is overloaded with forgettable jingles from television shows, literary journals and graphic design firms.  Whats good is the material that was recorded for albums and subsequently rejected, such as "Reprehensible", "Rest Awhile" and "Certain People I Could Name".  But there are too few of these real songs, and they'd have fit a lot better on that long-awaited b-sides collection from their major label career 
 I'm afraid this book is not what it looks. Though it is well written and somewhat interesting, if you need a how-to book on disaster recovery, this is not the right place. This 104 page booklet deals only with DOS and  Norton's undelete very basic features, hardly useable under real life  incidents. You'll find some tales about how to solve a suicide, or to  search for a criminal, how to get around some trivial password protection  and some other funny stuff, but don't expect to find your lost data after a  virus attack after reading this book 
 omigod, did this garbage really pass for "hot" 2 decades back? director albert magnoli has zero sense of pacing, editing, acting, story telling, etc. and prince is as bad an actor as ive ever seen. no, i take that back -- ive seen apollonia (who herein makes her role in "falcon crest" look like lilian gish)! i will not comment on the musical score; if you like it, more power to you and go buy the album. but a movie where clarence williams, III gives the strongest performance? well, thats not a movie i ever want to sit thru again 
 This book is dangerous and full of errors relating from a general ignorance of basic human development.  If you want your life not to change when you have children, DO NOT have children.   Following this third world orphanage model of raising a child is not the answer to sleepless nights and crying babies.  All crying eventually stops, either when the babies needs are met, or when the baby gives up hope.  
 Maybe if you are business-retarded this book might give you some ideas about the process of starting a business.  But most of the material can be found worded differently by online articles or by using some common sense.  Therefore, the book really does not provide any unique perspectives or tricks.  Anytime a book gives you the impression that you can achieve something in a short period of time or simplifies it in a few steps, you know the author has watered the topic down so much that it ends up being a waste of time.  But, hey its a good marketing strategy; it got me to buy it!   I'm a technology guy looking for a high-tech start-up book that really teaches you the "ins and outs."  Does anyone have any recommendations?  
 I think it's odd that the movie announces at the beginning that it's based on Homer's Odyssey, as the storyline barely follows in the theme of The Odyssey at all. The music is awesome and I reccomend the soundtrack, but honestly the movie didn't do it for me. Weak plot, annoying characters, lame ending. I just wasn't impressed at all. 
 With all due respect to Dr. Ablow, I thought he was really over-reaching in his analysis of someone he never met.  The book was filled with repetitive analytic conjecture about almost every sentence Scott ever spoke. Sometimes a duck is just a duck.  Dr. Ablow repeatedly states how Scott "probably said ....", or "probably thought..." and Lacy "probably replied..." The book is filled with these fictional guesses as to the thoughts and feelings that MAY have occurred.  Scott's apparent sociopathic behavior was traced in part to the murder of his maternal grandfather more than 50 years before Scott was born.  It's obvious that, to a great extent, our personalities are the result of our parental upbringing, but to relate dates of negative events in the life of Jacqueline Peterson to dates of negative events in Scott's life is patently ridiculous. Overall, I felt that this was just one more opportunity to take advantage of this sensational case to sell a book.  Very disappointing.  
 The locket on this cable chain is so tiny, you will not be able to put a picture in it.  After opening the box and being completely disappointed, I opened the locket to see how it worked.  It would not close properly after opening.  The quality of this necklace is not good - do not waste your money.  
 this is a 2 disk cd.  the first cd, if full of songs that you may have heard on the radio.  kelly clarkson, is one of the singers on the cd.  that is the main reason why i purchased the cd.  love that remix.  the other songs are ok, but the 1 cd is the best of the 2. 
 I started to read this book with great interest, as I had heard about the wonderful miracles that are taking place, etc.  However, it is biblically unsound at its very core, and it is very easy for a Christian to read this book and get very excited indeed.  Rutz expects that by 2032 approx., most if not all of the world will be Christians, and bases this on statistics into the future.  The Bible says that when Jesus returns there will be very few left with faith in Him, as many will have turned away.  Rutz doesn't want to mention Sin because, as he says himself in the book, he wants to keep it positive.  It is a dangerous book, in that you can so easily be taken in by it, and really, you need to keep your Bible handy to see if what he says is true.  It offers a "new" Christianity with very reduced, if any, writing in relation to sin, hell, and wrath, because the "new" Christians don't like these words and find they would be threatening to new converts.  However, ultimately, we each stand before God, and this diluted, poisonous book makes me feel so fearful for many Christians who will be taken in by it 
 I like Bryan Peterson's other books (Learning to see Creatively and Understanding Exposure) and I was guessing that this would be a combination of the two with some additional tips towards digital photography. I expected a lot out of the book, and it didn't come out. First of all, the 'photography' part of the book is good. Many examples and tips on how to make better pictures. But the 'digital' part of the book is bad, really, really bad. Virtually every advice Bryan gives is wrong, or given for the wrong reason. You get the idea that mr. Peterson wanted to jump on the digital bandwagon without knowing anything about digital camera's in the first place. I bought the book to give it to a friend who just got his first digital camera, and I wanted to see if it would be a keeper for myself. I'm keeping it, but only because I'd be ashamed to give it to somebody. Again, the photography tips are good, and if it wasn't for the author, I would have given it three stars. But I was expecting something better 
 The best thing about writing a book about a long-dead character is that they can't fight back.  Roland Huntford is a professional journalist of the worst kind who literally uses his "intuition" to invent history when the facts inconveniently contradict his view.  Huntford's purpose in writing the book was to make money; not to write anything approaching truth.  His book is very readable, more's the pity - it's just rubbish. Rather read Ranulph Fiennes book, "Captain Scott", which tells the story from the viewpoint of someone who knows Antartica and who presents a balanced viewpoint.  He also highlights a number of untruths written by Mr. Huntford.  
 I have found this book to be a good jumping-off place for futher discussion with other Christian women.  However, I would not recommend doing this study on your own.  Nor would I try to do it without some sort of commentary.  The verses that Mrs. Heald uses are often taken out of that context which is quite important for understanding them.  This is not to say that it is a bad book.  It just borders on vague in some areas, and does well with extensive further discussion about the passages chosen and the intention of the author in choosing them 
 Will smith is one of the worst rappers ever.Anyways only retards and jerks listen to rap music these days.these so called musicians do not play any instruments.DONT LISTEN TO RAP MUSIC.Get any LED ZEPPELIN album instead.AVOID AT ALL COSTS 
 When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.  Neither panned out.  This book is boring.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.  Too much detail and not enough substance.  Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it 
 Reading this book was exhausting, confusing, and extremely unsatisfying. Sentences and parqagraphs ramble arround with confusing descriptions and conflicting information. Some major elements that are introduced are left hanging; never brought up again. Others are revisited ad nauseum. Barr's quirky way of describing people and places with bizarre comparisons slows down the plot and is just missleading. Although I did stay with it until the contrived end, this is the first book I ever attacked with a red pen and edited a I went along. I estimate it could have been 50 pages shorter, and have carried far more impact, without the extraneous language. I am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books. I'd stay far away from her in the future and purify yourself by reading a clasic P.D. James or a pure and simple Sue Grafton 
 This was one of the boringest books i've ever read.... Unless you want to kill serious time, and you love all types of science-fiction... then this is the book for you. If not, then don't try reading this book. I don't like books that don't get you hooked in, and this DEFINITELY doesn't get you hooked. That's all i have to say about it. 
 I checked this book out from our library to see if it would meet my needs as an in-depth introduction and more to the neurosciences. I have a number of MIT press/Bradford books and expected quite a bit from this one. I was impressed with the breadth and range of topics and the quality of scholarship, but the incredible number of typos, particularly in the second section, left me steamed. Those poor authors who had the spelling of their names butchered in print have my sympathy. These typos include some in the diagrams, which lead to confusion. I expect a better quality of editing from a large professional university press. I bought Principles of Neuroscience (Kandel) instead. My advice would be to check out a copy of the Gazzaniga from your library and go over it to see if it is acceptable to you before you spend [...] on it 
 This book gives plenty of background into international finance.  Unfortunately, it has some big flaws, in my opinion.  First, there are not enough calculation examples.  Second, there are too few questions at the end of each chapter.  In addition, you must go to the author's website for the solution.  Once you get there, you will be surprised to find out that the author has only solved maybe two out of eight problems.  That's annoying.  I do not recommend this book.  Take a class from another professor who uses a different text book 
 I oppose property politically and found this book completely unhelpful. Its arguments are, without exception, specious, Proudhon's style is verbose and graceless, and his answer to the question of the book's title a verbal  wrangling which reduces the work to an attack a highly specific type of  ownership in favour of another. Proudhon is no anarchist and no anarchist  should look to this book for inspiration. It is of hitorical interest as a  stage in the development of radical philosophy, nothing more 
 This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative 
 This book was just way over my head. I was impressed with Acker's ability to vividly expose the true inner monologues of her characters, but I just didn't grasp the point or even what was going on half the time. This book  just totally bummed me out, and left me confused 
 I bought this based on the previous reviews. The book is very thin in content with about 250 cards per exam in the boook itself. It does not nearly cover the needed information.  The CD is better with more flash cards per exam, and a testing engine, but still thin in coverage and explanations.  It has information you can use, but not enough. If it was structured toward the exam requrements it would have been better. If you used the other Cisco press books, you don't need this, not even at the discounted price.  As a comparison, the CCNA flash cards book was much better. 
 Feels extremely fragile and rightly so, since it broke the first time I test fired it. Fortunately, I got it for free with another purchase. I wouldn't recommend this gun even for beginners 
 Working in the banking industry I was turned on to this book by a colleague and what a colossal waste of time reading this was.  The vast majority of this book's models are outdated and if Mr. Saunders was trying to write a historical piece he has accomplished that in spades.  Nothing in this book is relevant and it is obvious the esteemed Mr. Saunders lent his name to a very poor book that he probably should have glanced through if not read.  Linda Allen should probably get some real world experience because she is wasting people's time with her research 
 If you are looking for codes like Game Shark had, this is not for you.  Not only do you HAVE to have a computer, If anything happens to the disk, you are screwed.  You won't be able reinstall windows, or install it on a new computer.  Some games do offer rewards like unlimited health for %100 completion.  So if those are they games you plan on using,  this is the best thing out there 
 Danielle Steel used to be one of my favorite authors. However, Wanderlust was the last book of hers that I really liked. I bought The House hoping maybe she had found her "style" again, but alas it was not to be. I do not understand how a bestselling author can get away with combining points-of-view within one paragraph, "telling" not "showing" the story, and repeating the same things over and over and over until I just want to scream! It seems that perhaps because she is such a big name, her work is not copyread anymore. I think it might be time for her to put away her pen, or get back to the basics of good writing. I will not be buying another of her books anytime soon. I chose to rate this book with one star, because no stars wasn't a choice 
 Don't buy this set of books if you are interested in learning how to manage a 2000 server.  It is very theoretical and devoid of practical advice.  There are much better resources available if you are looking for a "how to" or reference book 
 This novel should remain forgotten in the dim past.  It's a period piece, all right.  Blatantly antisemitic -- and I don't think the author was making a comment on his characters in that regard; I think it was the author speaking.  Boring in stretches.  Long stretches.  I finally gave up and heaved the book across the room.  Out of curiosity, I read the author's Butterfield 8 a number of years ago and, trust me, it's worse. 
 So much of this book seems to be devoted to the singular objective of conjuring up and applying technique--for the sake of conjuring up and applying technique.  How about heart, soul,and guts, the innards of what makes a truly great novel great?  After reading Conflict, Action, and Suspense I find not the slighest nod in this direction.  If, for example, you set out to portray a protagonist with deep-seated psychological problems, is it best to first think of how to create conflicts and actions for him / her, as Noble urges?  Or, is it best to largely monologue your way into the story in order to "set up" the forthcoming suspenseful situations you have in store for him / her?  If you carefully shepherd the reader's thought-flow by way of psychological portrait, isn't this a better setting of the stage for real life-like suspense to follow?  Sure, most writers of books on writing will tell you that you must make things get very ugly, very quickly. But, is this really the best way to paint the Celebrated Dreamer, The Simpleton, The Fool In Love, The Anti-Hero who believes his peers are all conditioned to suppose they can get rich "thinking" while other schmucks sweat?  ##### Noble writes well enough. And, there is no shortage of ideas in this book.  But, alas, the ring of "artificiality" is too much for me.        
 OK. This book was obviously written from the perspective "Thou art holier than I". At times it gets so sugary it makes me want to gag...Everybody is complimenting the Dalai Lama right and left, but unfortunately, despite the Dalai Lama's warning that one should not try to put a yaks's head on a sheep body, these Christian morons consistently fail to ask tough questions, tripping on themselves to avoid pointing out insurmountable divergencies between the two traditions. The Dalai Lama basically uses the Gospel texts to teach Buddhist doctrine, a strategy the Jesuits used to be masters at. He is charming, profound as usual, but obviously totally unaware of the Christian tradition. So, next time, instead of getting into the business of "uh-oh-ah, please teach us how to read OUR OWN TEXTS!", I would like to see Dalai Lama's interlocutors do their job in a hopefully more critical and challenging way. And next time, please, oh, please, choose better texts!!! 
 This confusing,bad book is the WORST book in  history!Sorry Rosmary Sutcliff 
 Be sure you have a very flat, smooth surface for these bumper cars. There is almost zero clearance between the driving surface and the bumper part of the car. Our girls rode them in our driveway/sidewalk and constantly got stuck on uneven surfaces or the edge of the driveway. We had to make the girls get out and pick up and move the car to a flat surface. These are probably much better for a basement or a perfectly flat surface like a tennis or basketball court.  
 I WORKED THERE BRIEFLY AND THEY'RE RUDE AND OBNOXIOUS AND HAVE NO CLASS. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF SOME OF THE STORIES THEY'RE ACCUSING OF MAKING UP ARE TRUE. THEY DESERVE TO BE SUED AND STOPPED. ALL OF THEM ARE REPULSIVE, I'M GLAD I GOT OUT WHEN I DID! 
 The story line was fair, but the T&A not so hot... 2 star 
 I have read all of the books in this series prior to reading Sold Out. I enjoyed the series immensely and would have recommended the books to any teenager; however, after reading Sold Out, my opinion has changed. Chloe's initial character was appealing because of her harder edge and atypical image. Unfornunately, as I read the book, I felt as though I was not reading the words of a teenager. The slang was dated, including words such as "groovy" and "pretty tough chick" as if these are typical of today's teenagers. Casual conversation throughout the story was far too structured to be that of teenage lunchtime banter, making the story seem spurious. Also, the issues in this book were either exaggerated or trivial. Few issues that Chloe faced were relatable to teenagers today. The book was trite, dated, melodramatic, and mawkishly sentimental 
 I bought 2 mintek dvd players because I got such a "great" deal at kohl's department store.  I ended up getting each one for about $150, which was a great price compared to the original price. Within the first 3 months I had the same spinning of the disk and "no disk" message come up when there was a disk in it.  I immediately returned the one to Kohl's.  I kept the other one, to my dismay.  I had a hunch I should of returned it.  Sure enough, after the 90 day warranty, it began having the EXACT same problems, definitely a MINTEK problem.  I have emailed, made phone calls..several times with absolutely no human contact or response.  This company needs to be reported because they sell JUNK and back it up with absolutely NOTHING.   I figured I was already out a bunch of money, I just wanted to get it fixed so it was usuable...Can't reach anyone to do that.  There is a reason you can't find anyone...they know their products are WORTHLESS!!!. DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM MINTEK ..WORST MISTAKE YOU WILL EVER MAKE..AND TAKE A LOT OF YOUR MONEY WITH IT... 
 ok first of all let me say that yes this mic has a nice look and feel to it..also being wireless it adds to its attractivness but over all this mic after a long time of wearing it can really hurt your ear....it becomes very uncomfortable to wear and has even given me headaches, being as how me and a friend needed a headset we both bought one...i no longer use this headset while my freind has no choice till he gets his 360 also, and to this day he constantly has to say "hold up im switching my mic to my other ear cause this ear is starting to hurt" with the 360 controller and headset being wireless and it becoming more availible just wait cause in the end this headset isnt worth the price and it wont be compatible for your 360 
 This item is cheap and I don't mean the price.  It will not stay together.  The plastic frames do not attach well to the mat because it is held with velcro that keeps coming undone.  The arched bars are not bent enough causing one side to pop up off the floor.  I tried bending them myself, but they always return to their original shape.  Pay the extra money and get a better mat 
 This book is poorly written and not worth the money.  Too much time spent on vague ideals and notions of death and dying not enough substance.  Dr. Bolen spends very little time sharing the actual patient's stories and too much time on the New Age doctrine she so voraciously clings to.  A New Age sermon is what this book is, not a search for meaning during life-threatening illness 
 Woolf's style of writing (changing between several characters' thoughts) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio. The paperback proved to be easier for me. 
 Having read Clive Cussler adventures for over 10 years, i was totally disgusted with the redneck and narrow minded attitudes expressed in the book. The father, who does not stay with his son, decides to revenge his son fighting a war trying to kill people in someone else's country. That is perfectly justified!  The book mentions Hindu mercenaries who have not been seen anywhere in the world in any century much less this one. This is a direct insult to all Hindus as being one I am astonished at the insensitivity of the author. How come "Hickman" is not a "Christian" mercenary or for that matter the Corporation as they seem to be in this for the money. The justifications are ridiculous. India and Hindus of India have been terrorized, jailed, colonized and robbed by Christian and Muslims alike over the last 1000 plus years. You don't find us calling people by religion and we have all major religions in our secular country. We have grown spiritually to accept everyone, and I would like the authors to read more than a 2 page synopsis on religions before writing books. The book smacks of jingoism and is a pathetic display of the authors minimal knowledge of religions and global affairs 
 Lots of extra stuff that wasn't in Kaysen's memoir--that bothers me. It just seemed like it was a chance for Winona Ryder to attempt "real" acting, and to gain respect as an actor. Instead, Jolie snagged the Oscar, and Ryder slipped into A Scanner Darkly. Ryder again showcases her highly over-emotive acting ability that has been overrated from day one, and Jolie gets to look crazy and beautiful at the same time for the umpteenth millionth time. YAWN. Read the book instead 
 I really had high hopes for this book, considering all the good reviews it got.  And the author did have a good idea.  I just wish it had been executed better.  This book never really found a plot. It seemed like the author just wrote from stream of consciousness, explaining one mishandled curse after another.  On top of that, it wasn't written very well.  I felt like it was written by a 14 year old.  The dialogue was ridiculous. People don't talk the way she wrote them. And since it's written in first person, unfortunately the whole book has that same problem.  Another problem is the characterization, or lack thereof.  I never felt like I knew who any of these people, including the main character.  We were told characteristics about them all, but we aren't really shown them, so it's hard to really feel who these people are.  The "plot" centers around the main character learning and growing from having to deal with her curse power, but she doesn't seem to do much of either and instead becomes even more codependent through this process.  The ending is absolutely strange and completely ridiculous. I honestly can't even believe I finished this book.  I think I only did because it was sort of fascinating to see what stupid thing was going to happen next.  
 I realize Cold Springs is a novel - and so not bound by truth. However, I find the positive depiction of teen help boot camps, and escort services, disturbing and worrisome. Any parent with a drug addled kid, who happen to get ahold of this book, would likely be sent looking for a boot camp and escorts.  The abuse and gross neglect, so common to these programs was not represented in its true light.  The girl the story revolves around was treated brutally; did resort to killing and eating an armadillo; did have to wear her menstrual flow stained clothes; but this was all to the good (rolling eyes) and she was saved from herself as a result. *Sigh* Also, the escort the story revolves around was a murderer - but only of bad guys. I would like to suggest to those buying this book,  also buy a copy of :  "Help at Any Cost", how the troubled teen industry cons parents and hurts teens; by Maia Szalavitz.  Or, simply Google Aaron Bacon, the death of. Or Michelle Sutton, the death of. Or Nicholas Contreras, the death of. Read about the realities, if your going to read the pro brutality fluff pieces 
 The author uses little science to support her claims and assertions but "psychic visions" from the likes of Edgar Cayce. Though the book is interesting and easy to read, it cannot be taken as a serious work. The author should try to seek scientific facts to back up these psychic claims. If you are looking for a good book that provides scientific evidence for the former existence of Atlantis, don't look here! 
 Prey is to a novel what the "wild swarm" Ricky was to the real Ricky: It presents a suggestion of a real book, but lacks the features, the characteristics of the real thing ... and it disperses on the ground at the slightest breeze.   Like the worst of the bodice-ripper genre, Prey's hero, Jack, makes the stupidest decisions - or makes no decision at all - when presented with behaviors that would alarm anyone else ... all to make the plot move forward where Crichton wants it to go.   And when the communication lines were ripped out by the nano-Ricky and nano-Julia, I kept wondering whatever happened to Jack's cell phone? You know, the one he'd just used the day before to talk to his kids, and that worked just fine out in the desert?   Nevertheless, I kept reading to the end because Crichton's discussion about programming based on the natural world was fascinating. For that it gets a 2 rather than a 1.     
 As several people before have said, this is NOT the soundtrack to the epic trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. I myself own all three soundtracks and they make for one incredible 3.5+hrs of listening. THIS, however, is not even close to being the entire soundtrack. I love the packaging (I suggest they rerelease all the original soundtracks with that), but packaging alone doesn't make a CD.  Firstly, this "collection" removed the entire stock of work done by Enya in The Fellowship of the Ring (the entire second half of the soundtrack, from the Council of Elrond to May it Be [Ending Theme]). I found Enya's work extremely good and still wonder why they removed it. The rendition of May It Be (on CD 1) they have on this one seems devoid of vocals while the second one isn't done by Enya (again, I ask why). Secondly, they remove immense chunks from the other two movies. The soaring pieces of The Return of the King (The End of All Things [the reclaiming of the Ring by Gollum] and Andúril [Aragon's receiving of the Sword of Kings] for examples) are condenced into four pieces. Finally, they REDO all the work. What I hate about the constant rerecording of classical pieces such as Beethoven's 9th and Für Elise and other great works is they change the tones, depths, and emotions from the previous recording (sometimes, even adding or subtacting entire instruments). They do this to great effect (in a bad way) throughout this CD. Forth Eorlings, a magnificant piece from The Two Towers, is played as the riders of Rohan escape Helm's Deep, crushing the Uruk-Hai in their path while Gandalf and other riders charge from above. In this CD, they add a kettle drum and by doing so, slow the tempo of this uplifting piece while making it bombastic rather than majestic.   Overall, don't waste your money with this so-called "soundtrack". If you want each of the Lord of the Rings soundtracks, you'll either have to find another collection or buy each individually. But above all things, DO NOT buy this and expect the same wonderful pieces from the original score 
 After taking a long, considered look at the reviewvs available for "From Here to Etrenity," I noticed that many of them were giving 4/5 stars to the book.  Which then made me consider.  WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?  This was undoubtedly the worst book ever created.  It is considered a WWII novel, and yet there's only one chapter of combat in it, which doesn't even contain any honest-to-god fight.   Pearl Harbor was not considered a battle.  It was considered a massacre.    As I read this book, I could not help from falling asleep.  The few times I was awake, however, a strong passion to burn this filth raged like a fire within me.  How can anyone cosider this book decent.  All it is is getting drunk, going to a whore-house, getting caught, and then doing the same thing over and over again until either killed, arrested, or moved to a different continent.  The main character, Robert E. Lee Prewitt(called Prew by many), dies about 150 pages from the book's ending!    Ladies, and gentlemen, as I conclude this review, I ask you one thing.  Do not buy this book, and most surely do not read it.  Reading " From Here to Eternity" is like chewing on broken glass, except 100 times less fun. 
 It's hard to be too hard on this pretentious wad of snarling anti-reason, bleary new-age fog, wishful thinking, truely impressive ignorance of the genuine diversity of aboriginal cultures everywhere, or the centrality of Western science and reason to any successful human(e) endeavor in today's world. This book is an achievement of sorts -- many tin-type pictures; an out-of-date bibliography; an angry and assertive posture characteristic of the most herniated PC hype, guaranteed to appeal to a certain "cultivated" mindset; nice drawings and maps. This book is typical of current POMO (post-modernist) "historical" nonsense in a pretty package, a pastiche of the visually appealing with the intellectually bankrupt. Bruce Chatwin redux. 
 These did NOT suppress my appetite, though many days I took 3 tablets three times a day!  Had very good luck with a bottle of Dytrexil (also a Hoodia product), but the next bottle of THAT, nothing.  I guess like crops, you can get good batches and bad batches.  These struck me as a bad batch.  As one reviewer said, I actually felt HUNGRIER many days.  Egad!  Better luck next time!  Sigh 
 I purchased this model around 6 months ago, and the problems continue every day.  This machine won't fax multiple pages...instead it likes to pull the whole 5 or 6 page set through at once, thus jamming and causing headache.  Secondly, the machine likes to jam up while receiving.  I am not the only one I know with these problems.    I wasted good money on this product and I would suggest you not do the same.  Now I'm off to buy a new one of a different model; the old Canon got a swipe of the sledgehammer 
 I like to give authors at least one try before I decide that they are no longer worth my time.  Carole Matthews is no longer worth my time.  With or Without You starts off really strong.  The protagnist and her boyfriend have been trying for months to get pregnant using invitro, finally for him its enough and he also tells her he is leaving her for someone else.  Once she starts following (stalking) the new love of his life around and realizes that she is athletic she decides she too will go to Nepal to do a walking tour to show him how great she is too.  One thing I wish Matthews would work on is she will bring up something relevant that is never discussed again. For example, we find out that the protagnist at some time had an abortion but she never told her family or her boyfriend about it and let him believe he was the reason she couldnt get pregnant. It was never brought up again after that.   In addition, Matthews throws in characters that have nothing to do with the main story.  For example the sister with 10 kids who is contemplating having an affair with her exboyfriends best friend after meeting him one freaking time! It was annoying.  That and switching back and forth between the protagnistm, the exboyfriend, and the sister.    Also it took til practically the end of the book before we have her finally arriving in Nepal.  I wish Matthews had made the plane crash or something because this is where it gets bad.  Once she gets to Nepal she proceeds to have unprotected sex with the tour guide of the walking tour and than falls in love (after like 3 weeks!) and goes back to London realizes it is no longer the place for her and leaves her job, her house, her family to go to Nepal for a man! I just screamed in outrage and actually threw this book away.  I have never done that before I always keep my books but I saw red and wanted it out of my sight.   If anything I enjoyed it more when Matthews switched back to the exboyfriends story and his relationship with the new girlfriend. It was very good and made me wish she just focused on him.  
 This book is about a very interesting and important topic,but is poorly written and an effort to read.Extracting information from it is painful.I found myself skim reading after the first chapter trying to get to some useful information other than the academic soap opera of paul romers life.While an introduction is important,two long winded chapters is over doing it.The sentences are poorly constructed so you have to read them to the end to put the beggining in context,and so it is very hard to concentrate on,after finally getting to the middle it then deteriorates as the author loses the plot due to some external family or drug problem taking all of his attention,it also contains factual errors which while not important to the books message add to the amateur feel of the writing.Finally after totally deteriorating to the point of aiming it at the rubbish bin,at the beggining of the third last chapter I think,it is as if another author,or one fresh out of rehab takes over,and the book improves and stops drivelling on,although still has poorly constructed sentences and an unbelievable amount of typo's as in the first part.I can't believe the positive reviews it has recieved,including Peter Bernsteins back cover praise.Peters book is excellently written,and something this author and publisher should aspire to replicate.If you are desperate to learn about this subject and have a tolerance for pain and boredom then it is worth reading,especially now that the price has dropped,and the cover art would look great on your coffee table,but if not,wait until a second edition that has been proof read by someone competent or for another author to do the subject some justice.The most enjoyable part of this book is the irony that supposedly efficient markets produce products like this,of such poor quality,and that this book is about knowledge,yet lacks any knowledge of spelling,sentence construction or good writing practices or publishing practices.Its sad when you have to read the acknowledgements in the back to try and piece together what went wrong in the authors life.I totally get what this book is about,which is why i purchased it,and why its such a disappointment,I have recently read around thirty books on economics and investing and this is the only one that I have less than praise for.Products like this are a rip off due to unbelievably poor quality,I really can't believe it got published in a first world country.And I live in a back water ,who's native people this book also manages to disaparage and misrepresent 
 I bought this CD in order to get a few of the "big hits," and that's what I got--no more, no less, as most of the other songs are just so-so 
 Hardly any of this music was heard in the wonderful documentary series. A poor album by a decent fiddler but a genuinely lousy composer 
 I had no knowledge and little confidence about my ability to create a web page. Just a desire.  This broke down the ends and outs of creating a web page and showed me just how easy it is. Unfortunately, it has my confidence soaring right now and now I believe I can get a job in the web page creation business but I know where my talents lie 
 Yogananda's message is potentially world changing.  However, I got more out of the Autobiography of a Yogi published by Self-Realization Fellowship because it was full of added footnotes which I found just as important and meaningful as the text.  Many explaining the essential oneness of western and eastern religions through biblical passages, etc 
 It is difficult to believe Huxley was almost seventy and a highly regarded novelist when he wrote this piece of adolescent rubbish. It is also difficult to believe that so many reviewers think his ideas here are new and interesting. Well, I suppose they weren't so clichéd when he wrote them, but they certainly look very tired now.  The first couple of chapters are actually very good, as we are gradually introduced to the protagonist, Will Farnaby, finding himself shipwrecked on an island and encountering its inhabitants. His confusion and his obsessive thoughts about his failed relationships are very well portrayed. Unfortunately, after this the book degenerates into a very boring talk-fest, with a minimal plot that surfaces from time to time before coming to a fairly predictable end.  Island is, so we are told, Huxley's idea of utopia, but from a modern perspective, it looks more like a very idealistic view of a hippie commune: free love, child-sharing and family planning via sexual yoga, all under the benevolent influence of consciousness-expanding drugs. It's difficult to believe  he really believed it could work, but the whole thing is explored without a hint of sarcasm, and Will is so convinced by it all that he undergoes a total conversion experience.  The last chapter is well-written, apart from the flat ending, but Huxley had lost me long before then.  I disapprove of a writer using his novel as an excuse for preaching. I do believe that novels should have themes, and the more serious the theme the better, and I know that it is sometimes difficult to locate the precise line between thematic concerns and preaching - but this book is clearly way over the line. 
 Is it just me who thinks that the Discworld has lost its life? I always loved Discworld- I read and re-read every book up to Fifth Elephant with gusto, and I loved them like no other books in the world. But when I read Fifth Elephant, I found something had changed. There is just no life to this book. It wasn't remotely funny, the plot was confusing and unexciting... I don't know why, but I just didn't enjoy reading this one. I got bored with it after the first few pages, and it was a chore to read the rest. It was awful for me; like having a good friend suddenly turn on me. Every book following Fifth Elephant has, in my opinion, only gone downhill. It's not that Pratchett has run out of ideas, but that he seems to have lost his enthusiasm. It's horribly depressing 
 Although his interesting childhood kept you glued to the first quarter of the book, the rest is just a basic cowboy's life written with little or no techniques to keep you compelled to read every word. It is interesting to read, however, since he was a true to life cowboy. If I had to do over, I'd saved my money. 
 many of the other reviewers have captured the problems that this book suffers from. It is a crazy www of poor design and problematic realisation. This is not information design. spend the time you would have wasted  reading, thinking quietly. I have read contextual design which thinks  through integrating design with users and it is much more provokin 
 sometimes you get a good bargain - cheap price for a good quality shoe.  this case is a classic - you get what you pay for.  cheap price for a CHEAP shoe.    1)this shoe is very heavy for a comfort shoe. 2) no arch support whatsoever. The rubber is almost too thick. 3) i have SERIOUS doubths that this is a leather shoe.  feels like CHEAP VINYL AT BEST.  3 days into wearing them and it looks like my shoe is going to rip in half any minute.  this paper-like vinyl/leather is pretty thin and cheap looking.    this is by fat the worst pair of skechers i have owned ( this is my #14 pair 
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
  Unless you need a cure for insomnia, don't bother with this book.  It's the third of his Mars trilogy and no better than the first two.  The characters are flat, the viewpoint drifts all over and rarely if anything happens.  They all talk and talk and something that seems important is completely ignored and forgotten later.  If you made it through the first two books, you can maybe make it through this one.  Nothing however happens that you couldn't already figure out.  
 A great disappointment. The relatively fashionable cover doesn't reflect the inside of the book. The window treatments shown in this book resemble one another  and are old-fashioned and plain. An "Absolute-Beginners" type of book,but even so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I know 
 These are irresistably cute but they sound terribly tinny and they are unbearable for more than five minutes.  I regret giving them to someone I love as a gift.  They are now sitting on his desk as a decoration and he's still using his old speakers.  I know you might not be able to stop yourself from buying these; don't expect a pleasant listening experience from these speakers.  
 Unlike Cussler's other series, I found this first story of the "Oregon Files" slow going at first and rather confusing. There are just too many things going on (no problem, I suppose, for multi-taskers!) and way too many characters to keep track of. Also, there's little to no character development even of "Mr. Chairman", Juan Cabrillo. The fact that he and his companions are mercenaries (with a penchant for good deeds that pay well) doesn't compare favorably with the NUMA heroes. However, the plots were intriguing and getting the golden budda out of the country was exciting and more like the roller coaster rides I expect from Mr. Cussler and co-writers. I look forward to the subsequent Oregon Files with high hopes.  
 The information in this book isn't that much as you might think... The title is misleading in a way, it doesn't help to make you more popular, just because the information isn't much! I've read this book in just 30 (!) minutes (the book has 124 pages approximately)... So it's clear the information isn't that much 
 I'm not sure how anyone could possibly sit through this overblown, miscast, boring example of Hollywood at it's worst.  Gary Cooper has to be the most uncharismatic and non-talented actor to ever achieve star status.  It's pretty sad to me that Hollywood felt the need to cast a Swedish actress to play the part of a Spanish girl named Maria.  Were there no latino actresses working in 1943?  Total waste of celluloid and time 
 From the glowing reviews here, I guess I am in the minority. Essentially this was a 10 minute Ben Stiller schtick stuffed into a movie with the barest of plots. If you saw the trailer then you saw the movie because that is all there was -- just more of it. It was clever and fun at the beginning but quickly palled as it became repetitive.  The other actors were largely props with the exception of Robin Williams whose talents went totally unused.  Some of the reviewers have commented on how this movie shows how history can be fun.  What this movie had to do with history is beyond me because dressing people up in costumes does not represent history anymore than Halloween would. There was little creativity and the simple (very simple) plot was trite, predictable, and appeared to exist only to carry the special effects. The special effects were really the entire point of this movie and if you have young children I'm sure they will enjoy this film.  I know I did, I was just disappointed that there was nothing more than the special effects 
 Unless you are already an expert at security and are looking for a strictly abstract approach, save your money!! Ramachandran's ramblings go on forever, with little imparted to the reader. The best comparison I can come up with for the experience of reading this book is that it's the same as trying to learn a foreign language from a mime. If Ramachandran spent less time trying to impress us with a bibliography that goes on for pages [I don't really CARE if he has read every security book in the world, if he can't distill this information down and pass it on the text is worthless] and more time on organizing his book [for heaven's sake, is a decent index at the back too much to ask?] then it may be usable, as it is, the only thing to do with it is level a table 
 Prager spends too much time pandering to right wing Christian Evangelicals.  His version Judaism is soured 
 Ok, I don't have this doll, I won't buy this doll...If I ever have a little girl she will never have anything like this. I saw some girls saying how the doll was appropriate for 10-13 and I almost fell out of my chair! This doll is -IN-appropriate for someone under 21! The short skirts the short tops. How the heck can Mattel think that this was a good idea? I'm 23 years old and I would NEVER dress like that NOR would I allow my CHILD to dress like that. Bottom line: SHAME ON YOU MATTEL!! 
 Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy Card's writing, especially his, uh, "Enderverse".  I loved Ender's Game, I absolutely adored Speaker for the Dead, I'm reading Xenocide and I love what I've read, and I liked Ender's Shadow.  I don't like Shadow of the Hegemon though.  It's nothing but boring, long and tedious talk about...politics.  Also, Card doesn't seem to understand how much the world would have changed in 200 years.  I don't know, I seem to like Card better when he's writing about philosophy, not politics 
 To list all the statements in Roscoe Blunt's book "Foot Soldier" that are factually incorrect would take more space  than a review should use.  I will cover only one action, the Roer River crossing.  I made this crossing with the first assault in a boat at 0330 23 February 1944.  I was a member of the 1st Battalion Headquarters Company Antitank Platoon 334th Regiment 84th Division.  For the Roer crossing I was part of a bazooka team attached to Rifle Company C.  This operation is accurately portrayed in the 334th Regimental History "Fortune Favored the Brave", Mannheimer Grossdruckerei, August 1945.  My name PFC Douglas J Harvey on page 136 establishes that I was in this attack.  The Divisional History "The 84th Infantry Division in The Battle Of Germany" states Blunt's Regiment, the 333, crossed the Roer River on the 24th on the well-established bridgehead.  His account indicates tanks were crossing at the same time.  The first tanks crossed noon of the 24th establishing that he was not in the first wave.  Only two air attacks by individual aircraft, ME 262s, one of which was shot down, are mentioned in the 84th divisional history.  However, artillery hits were frequent.  Blunt's stories of throwing grenades, being strafed by waves of planes, and hand to hand fighting after crossing on the foot bridge are pure fantasy.  This all supposedly took place 36 hours after the initial attack of which I was a part.  I had difficulty in reading all of Blunts book because of my frequent anger by his distortion of facts.  No star was not an option or I would have used it.  Douglas J Harvey   PFC 1st Battalion Headquarters Company Antitank Platoon 334th Regiment 84th Infantry Division 
 I read to be entertained.  As most American males I've always had some interest in Playboy Playmates so I thought this might be an interesting read.  What was interesting was hearing of Hef's Wednesday/Friday orgies that end up with multiple girls and him.  Nice life Hef. Unfortunately, the author, who begged to live the Playboy lifestyle and pursued a photo shoot layout and invitation to the mansion, suddenly gets morals and is shocked and appalled by what she discovers.  What was she thinking?  Her only point is she thought Hef was so old (and physically gross) she couldn't believe the girls actually had to sexually perform with him.  DID SHE ACTUALLY KNOW ANYTHING OF HIS LIFESTYLE?   So if you want to know what goes on with Hef and his girlfriends, it's here.  Unfortunately, everything else in this book is pathetic.  She's 30 but continues to tell us how beautiful she is as she aggressively pursues her dream with boyfriend in tow.  What a klutz he must be to fall for this!  Then when she somewhat achieves her dream, she's shocked by the degradation and jealousy among the girls.  Come on!  When you're living with a guy with lots of money and multiple girlfriends there is destined to be jealousy amongst the girls.    Overall, this is a very bad book written by someone who wants her 15 minutes in the spotlight.  There is not enough material for a book and the writer clearly is in love with herself which comes off pathetic in the book.  If you want to see what Hef's up to maybe you'll like the book.  Other than that the only positive comment I can relay is that it is a short book.   
 Although the premise of the story is a good one, the way it is handled literarily fell very short of expectations.  I kept wondering whether his editor was on vacation for allowing the contant ranting and philosophical tangents, leaving absent the "showing" that might have been more appropriate to a novel.  The story had interesting ideas to explore regarding holocaust victims and their children, but doesn't bring any light to the ideas, just a overblown ghost story which doesn't deal with the concept of "golem" at all and instead virtually slanders a generation of disturbed writers, despite the apology at the outset of the novel.  I finished it only because I had assigned it for my book group and was embarassed to have done so.  Steer clear 
 I was using VCOM SystemSuite Pro 6 and it was working to my satisfaction.  But, after I reconfigured my PC to "Standard PC", the software rejected my Serial Number, claiming I was using the software on another PC.  I only own ONE pc.  Technical help claimed the serial number has been used on 6 pc's.  Well, that is totally incorrect because, like I said, I only have one pc and the software cd has never left my house.  They have a Bug in their serial number checking process.  Anyway, they would not help me restore the software serial number because I could not furnish proof of purchase.  They think I am a crook. I'm not, I only want what I paid for to work 
 this book is interesting, don't get me wrong... but the author really went overboard with the length... it's too long... it's divided into two parts: power and pleasure. Power is interesting, but i was looking forward to the second part. I thought it would concentrate on the social aspects that make Bombay the city that it is... religion, food, tradition, etc. All I got was 200 more pages that centered on several characters who are not special at all...It ended up bothering me, how he dedicates such a long part of the book to this dancer that he calls "Monalisa", when there is nothing extraordinary or remotely interesting about her... complete waste of time...I don't understand his infatuation with her.  The endless stories about his experiences in Bollywood are boring as well. Very disappointed...  It would have been a good book had it been only 200 pages long.  Sorry Suketu! 
 There isn't a lot of Style Council product available domestically, especially on DVD, so it was with great anticipation that I ordered this disc...and I wasn't disappointed!  The song selection offers a nice overview of TSC career, and there were some nice surprises such as "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" and "Life At A Top People's Health Farm".  Although some of the videos are cheesy when compared to today's more slick videos, it is nonetheless a fine piece for any Paul Weller fan 
 I heard "You're the One" one morning on my local radio station and just HAD to find out who the artist was.  Their online "last song played" service was down, so I came to Amazon.com to see if I could track it down, and low and behold I found Across the Winterline.  I immediately clicked on One Click Ordering and awaited it's arrival.  What a TOTAL disappointment.  "You're the One" is a wonderful piece of music.  There is no doubt that Jack Williams is a remarkably talented guitarist and vocalist.  I love his melodies, especially when he sticks close to his talent for no holds barred blues.  He has a great voice, gravelly, resonant and warm.  BUT . . .  With the exception of "Your the One" and maybe one or two other songs that escape me at the moment, his lyrics are just terrible.  Not just terrible, irritating, anoying doggerel.  They are full of some of the worst forced rhymes, trite cliches and cheap sentimental bromides I've ever heard.  Some of these lyrics are so bad they are painful to listen to.  If you can afford it, buy this CD and add "Your the One" to the blues list on your IPod, RealPlayer folder, or include it in a compilation CD you burn, and then throw this one away.  That's what I did.  Otherwise, just pass 
 What a waste of time.  This collection is mired in typical Jacobs'School academic-speak.  The language throughout is just like I remember it at IU grad school...people using big words to make themselves seem more important. Don't buy it. 1 star 
 Klaus Blasquiz's book is a noble effort, but weak on details, weak on pictures and unbelievably weak on editing and proofreading. One gets the impression that English is not his first language - and the fact that nobody fixed this in editing is unforgiveable in a "professional" reference book. I recently got the Black and Molinaro book, it's WAAAY better with lots of luscious photos 
 Captain Alatriste is the first in a series and, like a lot of series, you're really rooting for it to be a barnburner so you can go right out and buy the next one and then wait breathlessly for the one after that.  Unfortunately, this is not the case with Captain Alatriste.  The problem is that there isn't enough of Captain Alatriste in Captain Alatriste.  It's told through his own Sancho Panza, Inigo, his steady sidekick, who has stories of his own to tell.  But those stories only distract from the main story, which is paper thin to begin with.  Throw in a lot of songs and poems and you've got a sleepy reader

 "A Walk to Remember, is my favorite book.  I have read it at least three times.  You have all kinds of emotions when you read this book.  First you will smile, then you will find yourself crying.  It almost takes your breath away when you read about the love these two young people share.  Has you read this story, Nicholas Sparks makes you feel like you have know this couple all there lives. I highly recommed this book to anyone that loves romance.  And that believes in fate.  
 but i ordered it and amazon sent me an entirely different product. I got ordered the leapfrog and received a generic product. pretty deceptive actually. not happy 
 This series began with so much promise, and then slowly, as it wore on, it became a jumbled mess. Ms. Elliott had so many strings to tie up, and so many storylines to complete that I think she lost her path. Instead of focusing on completeing the arcs throughout the book. She choose to start new ones!! In the final book, in the last one hundred pages. The Blessing arc, which she could have fleshed out so much more, came to a closing that left so much unexplained. Why did she age so fast, the implications of being with the Aoi, her reunion with Liath. These important plots, which drew readers in, and made them fans of the series were either brushed over or summarized in the last few chapters of the book.   Though the author promised to tell us who Alain's parents were, After completeing book the reader is still not sure.  Then she attempts to tie in the Lady of Battles in with the Alain/Fifth Son arc and it was a mess. As if Alain and Fifth Son knew the entire time what would happen when in the first six books they were as lost and confused as Liath. I am going to have to reread it just to get a handle on what happened. Also, she never explains what happens to major characters. In the last chapter (epilougue)of the book she introduces a whole new set characters and uses them to basically summarize the main characters lives.  I was so upset, because she spent the first two hundred pages with very little plot advancement. Finally the pivotal meetings, Liath and her grandmother, Liath and Hugh are brushed past so fast that you wonder if you were on a wild goose chase the entire series. And don't get me started on the Sanglant/Henry's childern arc. Overall, I would not reccommend this book to ANYONE!!! Which is saying alot, since the first three books in the series were so fulfilling. 
 Rairly have I read a book that I hate.  This is it!  Not only is it not funny but it is insulting to anyone who would sit in his dining room.  Tony's fan base just lost one 
 Beware, these scissors are low quality, not what you would expect from Henckels.  They are manufactured in Korea and China with cheap, uncomfortable plastic handles.  I own a genuine pair of Henckels kitchen shears which I purchased at Macy's about 20 years ago.  They are still in great condition and work perfectly.  This is the type of quality that I was hoping for when I purchased this 5-piece set. Unfortunately, what I got was a set of cheap imitations. I returned my order.  Don't make the same mistake that I made 
 If you are looking to get some cardio activity from dance keep looking. If you try any of these moves in a club prepare to never be let in again!  This video is is the same old cheesey aerobics routines only with the participants wearing "club" clothing instead of spandex. I was very disappointed with this purchase 
 I purchased Hotel Costes backwards from 6,5,4 and then 2. I don't know why I skipped 3 and bought 2 first.  But 3 and 1 isn't worth listening to, unless you want the whole collection of the Hotel Costes series 
 This was the first Hard Case publication book that I have tried.  It won't be the last, but I was hardly impressed with King's story.    I don't so much mind having a story with no ending (I got the point even without the author's afterword that was obviously meant to propitiate his regular readers who he correctly feared would be disappointed by this latest work), but couldn't King have given more of a mystery?  That is, after all, what is expected of a crime-mystery book.  I can't believe that I was asking too much.  Instead, I was treated to 178 pages of "Welcome to Maine!"   
 I love the DK Episode's VI-IV & I,II Vehicles and Locations but I found the Episode III Space ships and Vehicles not all that amuseing I feel that it wasn't a completed book to end the spectacualr tiology books in the detailing of the great space ships and vehicles. The reason why I didn't get this one as my collection was becuase I didn't see Padme's Naboo Skiff, which we really didn't get to see much in the film, but i would of have liked to see the detaling at least . Over all it's a great book but not enough 
    This is really cheap product placement material put out by DC to prmote Batman Begins as the movie is released.  Here for about 200 pages, learn how a fictional charecter fights villians by using various combat and fighting methods.  Read it only on a rainy day, and maybe not even then.  Dixon and Beatty really need to get real books to write.... 
 I did not like this audio book.  Out of all of Danielle Steel audio books this one was the worse and most depressing story. In a world of finding a new job and starting to date again. It was a story of a women who was having a problem finding the right man.  It tells you a sad story of the man who used her and the man who was afraid to commit himself to another woman long after his wife died and he tryed to started to date again. 
 Just another of the endless sagas, with much detail but little story!  The characters get on their horses and off, they tie them up, talk for a while, then get on again;  The author repeats this cycle over and over again with a little action thrown in every 70 pages or so!  If you love minute detail and endless repetition then you'll love this book 
  I bought this for my grandson. It took him about three minutes after receiving this to have a problem with the release latch. I was with him and saw he did nothing more then cast and retreive. I think it is a waste of money 
 This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  "Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed. 
 Q, the Winged Serpent was one of the worst movies I have even seen. I went into the film knowing it was a "B movie", but still wanting to be entertained. I was not entertained.   For a 1982 film, the gore in Q, the Winged Serpent, probably shocked quite a few people. There is also a [...] scene that is quite enticing. But aside from these two points of note, the film offered little else, including entertainment.  The acting was passable, but of course with such a dull story and script to flesh out, the OK acting goes to waste.  Save your money. This is one of the worst movies ever made. There are far better B movies. It is the type of movie I would have liked in college in 1987, if I had been drunk and looking for laughs. But this is 2006, and there are better bad movies with better gore and nudity. You won't like Q, the Winged Serpent, at all. Even for the drunk college student, there are far better ways to spend 90 minutes. Stay away.  Total Score (out of 100) = 7  2 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film. 4 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting? 1 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story? 0 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?  0 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting? 0 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase 
 I really was interested in the topic of Arab history but found the writing so boring I had a hard time staying awake.  I finally gave up.  I would look for another book on this subject 
 The camera has really amazing features. But it also has an outrageously major focus weekness. I made a mistake of buying one 
 This book was written in an obvious "My dad is bigger than your dad" frame of mind.  The author makes not doubt about who he thinks is the "alpha male" in the bunch.  President Clinton made a statement while on Air Force One and it was an opportunity to tell the world about his unsimpathetic words while President Bush is just a stumbling, chokes on himself when talking in public , "Awwww! Shucks that isn't what I meant to say!" kind of a guy.  Pres. Bush can outrun anyone, even in shape well built secret service guys, on his feet or his bike.   	If you're a firm believer in Bush you will love this, I'm a bigger, better man than you, book.  If you're an anti Bush person, you'll see through the bush=sh*% and through it in the trash.  This book made me wonder who wrote it; Bush or Sammon.   
   I watched the film in the theater when it came out, was very disappointed in all the inaccuracies. Trying to "entertain"/ educate people on a subject matter so serious with a plot so ludicrous is irresponsible at best. The Pet Dog was cute but also unrealistic. The book "The Gold Crew" had a more believable plot.    Having served on a few Ballistic Missile Submarines, I find it an insult to the Crews of the Boats Especially to the Captains and officers.   It's Understandable why the Navy Refused to Bless this. By placing there seal of approval on this film they would be saying it could happen, which it couldn't as depicted. Too much control and too many people in the loop to allow it.   From November 15, 1960-May 25, 2001. The Navy completed 3500 Deterrent Patrols which roughly equates to 671 years of combined ship service on alert ready to launch. And there Still out there boring holes in the water  
 Ok first off the art work is actually pretty damn good if you like comic art from 40z comics by Jim Mahfood, Invader Zim, Johnny homiciadal maniac ect..... But, seriously don't buy this flaming turd.... I checked this out from something called the Library which lets you look at books for free!  Story plot is very very bad.....Take matrix take bill and teds adventure and spice in some akira rip offs and you have this bland book.  The consensus has been slowly taking away our dreams towards making us all mindless slaves in our "awaken" reality.  But, our hero Zeke gets to club zero thanks to some akira clones that brought certain people to the club. He's the key for the akira clones to break on through to the other side ie the present awoken world.  And also they need him to help stop the consensus from making everyone mindless in either realm.  Oi enough of this crap it goes on and on.  Zeke gets those at the club to remember it in awaken world dad isnt dad or is he. Consense can offer him everything if he stops and oh boy big confirtation at the end where it's all up to Zeke to deterimine what's going to happen to reality as we know... What does he do?!?!? Oh guess what one makes their own choices and decisions in life cause Zeke choose's YOU!! Yes YOU!! Thats right!!! What the F crap ending is this?!? Why it's something out of choose your own adventure book or some crappy ass lesson  brought to you by barny the loveable dinasour! The only way you could give this a 5 star rating is if your brain is rotted out on E bomb cause like matirx 2 half of this book waste pages just showing the kids at rave after rave! 
 After volunteering to look at this play for my Classics degree, I started out with high hopes.  But after opening it and dicovering how boring it was, my hopes faltered.  I still gave it a go though and a couple of hours later when I finally got ready to start writing whether it was actually good enough as a play, my problems started.  Bearing in mind that it was written 2500 years ago, i was intrigued that a play could last for so long.  But honestly, thats where my interest stopped.  It's lenghthy and dull, and although I know that it is a very historical and precise play, I just couldn't follow it.  If you want bedtime reading that will send you to sleep, this is the one, sorry 
 I read this book and was vastly disappointed. It should not be placed on the same shelf as David Drake or David Weber. If you want a good book with a good story line, plenty of action, and any type of ending to the book at all stay away from this book and go with something else 
 Under the Volcano is a great novel--one of my favorites. But this edition has many, many spelling errors and typos...so many that they're a distraction. It's a shame, because otherwise I think this edition's design is clean and very readable. Definitely read the book if you're interested, but not this edition 
 This book is a dreadful example of the academic mind's pulling out all the stops in an attempt to be thorough and scholarly. What could have been a fascinating book (what material!) becomes a penance to plow through 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox! I will Update again - Feb. 10,200 
 I rate this "0". I bought the GE 75300 CD/Radio to replace an older model GE 74290A. The CD player crapped out on the older model. I have a GE kitchen and was some what happy with the older model. The GE 75300 is difficult to adjust the volume, the CD player skipped at the slightest disturbance in the room and I was totally not happy with its performance or sound quality. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. THERE ARE BETTER PRODUCTS OUT. The only good point with the GE Spacemaker Under Cabinet Mount CD/Radio is the "light". I will mount the GE 75300 in the garage and use it as a night-light.  I replaced the GE75300 with a Sony FM/AM CD Kitchen Clock Radio IFC-CD523. The Sony sounds awesome (IT ROCKS), does not skip even with the volume all the way up, is easy to operate, can easily turn volume up and down, can turn Bass on and off (I could never find a way to turn the Bass off on the GE). The Sony has no light, but I can live without the extra light. I will NEVER buy another GE CD/Radio for the kitchen. 
 The author gives a lot of psychological reasons why its good to give head and why you need not be insecure about it and how it can bring you closer and more intimate emotionally to your lover.    It took 100 pages into the book until she got to the good skill building tools you will actually use to accomplish your task. That was frustrating.  The author's tone conveys the message that everything under the sun with as many participants, in all kinds of scenerios is perfectly acceptable: homosexual,S&M, 2 girls and a guy in a daisy chain, anal sex (not sure what this has to do with the title of her book) and pornography etc.    I already thought fellatio was ok.  That's why I bought the book.  I just didn't enjoy having to read about all this other stuff I'm not so into and felt pushed on me, just to find some useful tidbits on deep-throating, for instance.  What makes this book different from Hooper's or the other guides is that there are no color photos.  Instead, there are erotic stories written by Alyson Tyler.  These I found degrading.  I am married and I found these vignets cheapened human relationships into mere sexual body part encounters.  They were not a turn on and did not enhance the book.  Violet Blue's language and tone/ attitude seemed low class to me and sadly lacking in the warmth she hopes fellatio will generate in your relationshp.  All the relationships portrayed seemed to cheapen the beauty and spirituality in sexual relationshps all the while attempting to normalize comittment-free somewhat risky sex.  (She explains safer sex...and then glorifies through Tyler's stories and instructional techniques and scenerios which ignore her safe sex guidelines).  Even if you forgive her crude language (which actually didn't bother me) and anything-goes style, I think most female heterosexual readers would find Lou Paget's book How to Be a Great Lover: Girlfriend to Girlfriend Totally Explicit Techniques to Blow His Mind so much more helpful.  Paget gets to the point with techniques that really work and will keep you feeling sexy rather than trampy.  H. Smith Los Angeles, C 
 I read a lot, and more than a few books by academics. But even though I was keenly interested in the subject of this book, and what Fenster would have to say about it, I found the reading so utterly dry and boring that I couldn't get even a third of the way through the book. I put it down and came back to it several times, trying to bring a freshness to it. But each time I was drugged to catatonia within a few pages. I gave up trying to read it straight through, and tried skimming and jumping around to get some key points. It didn't help. The author appears more intent on scholarly notes and quotes and references, than on making a clear and readable narrative. Unless you are an academic doing research, or a lay reader with an iron stomach for this kind of material, I would find another book 
 This book is basically hardcore porn in writing. There is no plot or story line just sex on every page. It is trashy and depicts sex in the most untasteful manner. 
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 This is the first book by Deaver that I have read.  Apparently there are a couple of prequels to this novel involving the same main characters -- I will never read them.  Deaver has adequate style and a talent for pacing a mystery thriller.  He also has some skill in character development; however, he only applies this skill to the secondary characters in this story.  Perhaps the main characters in this story appeared so flat to me because I have not read the other novels in this series, but judging by their inconsistent behavior, bizarre motivations, and the melodramatic dialogue in this novel I doubt the other books could be much better.  Worse than Deaver's hackneyed mystery cut-out-characters is his insistence that the reader be willing to accept the most unbelievable and unlikely situations for the sake of a dramatic situation or plot twist.  Like many other second-drawer mystery writers, Deaver portrays such notable organizations as the FBI, INS, US Coast Guard, and the NYPD as ridiculously inept and corruptible.  Nor has he made any attempt to research the actual policies and procedures that these organizations would follow in the situations presented in the story.  Deaver also has a poor grasp on the politics of international economics.  This is normally excusable in a mystery writer, but since Deaver sets Chinese/American economics as the foundation of his final plot twist the whole story comes crashing down in the final chapters of the novel.       A note to Deaver and other mystery writers:  it is not a requirement for a great detective to be a pompous jerk and an abrasive know-it-all.  It has been 115 years since Doyle introduced the world to Sherlock Holmes, and we have had 115 years of mediocre mystery writers plagiarizing Doyle's character.  Please try to be original.   And also, if the final "twist" in your story is so complicated and so unbelievable that you must expend two chapters in trying to explain it, perhaps it shouldn't be there in the first place.  I give this book a D.    
 It is really difficult to like a book where there are no likeable characters.  Morgan is a middle aged man who leaves his wife and many children for a much younger woman (that he seems to stalk for a while).  There are so many disturbing factors in this book that revolve around the main character (stalking of his new wife, impersonating a doctor, impersonating a postal worker, etc) that it made it very difficult to empathize with any of the emotions he might have had.  The book also seems to 'glaze' over the 'weirdness' of these behaviors.  
 Of the 7 or so Grisham novels Ive read this one is my least favorite.  It's not a bad story at all but it's just way too long, about 150 pages longer than it needed to be.   It also just lacked credibility in many spots. Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible, if not really interesting. Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating. This book, however, plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work.  The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway, the 11year old protagonist. He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old, using words like "wonderful" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70's. I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters.  This isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable 
 People were talking about this movie as if it were the next Silence Of The Lambs.  There are several reasons why this is not so.  1. The Dumbest Cop In The World:  This character never calls for backup, and is too slow to think of the most obvious clues.  At the end, he even throws down his gun to have a fist fight.  He'd never survive on the Sopranos. 2. It's sooooooo 1998.  This movie assumes you know nothing about the internet.   3. It tries to be cool by combining BDSM, body modification, and rituals, but in the end it just makes all these things look bad. 4. It's inconsistent.  The Dee Snider character "retires" all his piercings for a few years, and then suddenly they're all back in the next scene.   5. It's unrealistic.  Where the heck did Snider get that second dungeon from in just a day? 6. I won't even get into the gaping plot holes.  The acting, pretty bad.  The dumbest cop in the world character has just one mood:  Grumpy.  Amy Smart is totally wasted in this movie.  Snider's pretty good though.  Actually he's really good.  Really, bottom line:  You have only two reasons to buy this movie. 1. You are easily entertained and you have no problem with plot holes so big you can drive a Twisted Sister tour bus through them with room to spare. 2. You're a Snider fan and you must own this.  If you belong to one of those two groups, go for it.  For Sister fans, they'll enjoy how the movie roughly follows the plot of the song Captain Howdy/Street Justice.    You've been warned!  
 While coach Newton has done an amazing job of team-building and creating a winning tradition, he does so using workloads that may be counter-productive to an athlete's long-term development. He freely admits  that his concern is how an athlete performs NOW, not later in the athlete's  career 
 What a disappointment - the reviewer who mentioned the difficult-to-use switch was right, it was a poor design choice.  Needlessly heavy too, with poor balance 
 The original "Fine Without You" is about 3 million times better than the techno garbage that it was remixed into.  Please, if you've got no experience with Alk3, don't judge them based on the song that they for some reason let slip onto this soundtrack.  My god.  It's as if someone said, "hey, let's drop this stereotypically boring techno beat behind this song, and speed up the voice track a bit, that'll make it OMG AWESOME"... well, they were wrong.  Seek out the Alkaline Trio/One Man Army Split EP if you want to hear the good version of this song, better yet, seek out any Alkaline Trio cd, and you'll find great music.  As a matter of fact, bypass this soundtrack altogether, it sucks 
 Please do not waste your money on this badly written, infomercial of a book.   Most of the book is about how everything around you is bad for you. The water you drink, wash in, air you breathe, food you eat, medicines you take, etc. Almost everything you can think of the author says is bad for you. The author spends most of the book repeating him-self over and over. He advises everybody to stop taking all drugs and stop seeing doctors. When the book finally gets to how to treat yourself "naturally" the author directs you to sign up for his web site.   There is one especially ridiculous section in the book. The author says he knows a natural healer who has a special machine which keeps you balanced. The machine can monitor you 24/7 and rebalance you even when you're somewhere else.   My whole life I have been very weary of doctors and the pills they hand out. Doctors have made me sicker than helped me. The problem is that the author says that everyone should stop going to doctors and stop taking medications. There are a lot of people I know with cancer, aids, muscular dystrophy, parkinsons disease that would die or get very ill if they stopped taking their medications. 
 This is not a good book about Jim Morrison. Throughout the book, the author expresses very negative views on Jim, his work and his personal life.  His sources are not reliable.  He does not write in a way that makes the reader eager to see what the next page brings 
 This is the second Miniter book a nephew gave me with the idea that it would convert me to his way of thinking. Right from the very cover, it doesn't. The title is a prediction, and it's a premature one. He did this in that other book "Disinformation..." That too has a prediction of how "we're undermining the war effort."  This book bothers me on a number of levels.   First, it's the impression Miniter wants to give to the reader that he is an investigative journalist who is objective, and has no agenda. The title of his two books (that I know of) reveal an agenda. He writes for a periodical called "Human Events." This publication is widely regarded as having a right-leaning, conservative philosophy and editorial staff. If he does have an agenda, which I think even a blind man could see, then he is an advocate, not an investigative journalist. He is promoting a conclusion rather than finding one.  Second, I have gone through the irritating process of checking some of Miniter's sources: newspaper articles, opinion statements, and many others that offer no empirical evidence to support his, in some cases, wild assertions.  Third. Let's get to those assertions. The fact that we haven't been attacked in five years because of this administration's anti-terror campaign means nothing. It is conjecture. There could be reasons he could not even fathom. More importantly, what would Miniter's explanation be if we were attacked tomorrow? Would it somehow be Clinton's fault? By the way, in a truly fact-based book, Steven Flynn, a retired Coast Guard officer, states that the 9/11 attack was five years in the planning.  Fourth. Miniter's assertion that the mainstream media know about the same information he has, but don't report it because a) they don't want to, or b) their editor will kill the story, or whatever is even more conjecture. Is it just possible that main stream media press don't see the story in the same way Miniter WANTS it to be seen? Is it possible that they see it as speculation rather than fact?  Fifth. Our beliefs. It is a fascinating feature of the human psyche that people will pursue those opinions which confirm their beliefs. They will describe this book as well-researched without ever checking them, or they will say the book has many sources without checking those either. Just so long as they want to believe it's steak, it will be, even though it is only hamburger.  Six is a question. Is his prediction coming true? Are we winning the war in Iraq. This the biggest test of the book's credibility. We have ten of our twelve divisions committed around the world constantly. Troop levels in Iraq are at an all-time high. More national guard units will be activated, or units will be rotated with less time out of a combat zone. Our losses are not declining. Iraq is an unstable government. Shi'ia and Sunni are murdering each other daily. The Iraqi army is allowed to return home for a couple of weeks whenever they want to, or they will refuse to fight outside of their province. With no clear statement from this administration of what victory is, how can Miniter write a book with "Bush is winning the war on terror" in the title? Winning what?   This title as well as his conclusions are premature. I am old enough to remember another title published in Reader's Digest many years ago. It was called, "Why We're Winning in Vietnam." It was written by the Commander of the US Army Vietnam, General William Westmoreland

 I gave this book 2 stars because it is historically significant to understand the thinking of the gender feminists of the 1960s.   I also found the discussion of the equality feminists from the 1800s to be interesting. The right to vote for women was of course important as were several other causes that the equality feminists fought for.  I rated this book low because the author attempts to explain the housewife phenomenon but ends up overgeneralizing and trying to speak for all women. The author is very snobby and self-rightous, thinking she is able to determine which women are really fulfilled and living their life to it's fullest potential. The ideas in this book are what caused people like my mother to talk negatively about "dumb housewives," and to eat their words when their own children, such as myself, grew up and became...housewives (or what we now call "stay at home moms." Which, I might add was mostly fueled by watching my workaholic mother (who I do love very much) who didn't seem to enjoy anything in life...except work) Fortunately, we can teach our biased and prejudiced mothers that some women really do get fulfillment from raising their own children/homes.   I am only going to touch on some of the ridiculous arguments in this book, because there are too many to list:  Ms. Friedan gives "evidence" that children in other's care actually turn out better than those raised by their mothers. Great. So, she was teaching a generation of women that they are better off working than caring for their own children; that other people can do a better job than they can. What a vote of confidence.   The author goes on and on about how mothers were smothering their children, and this is why many turned to a life of the "feminine mystique." Sorry, but a 1950s mom with 7 children and a lack of modern conveniences did not have time to smother her children. Basic care for as many children as women had in the 1950s would consume most of a mother's time. If you want to see parents who overwhelm their children with attention (and material goods) and live vicariously thru them, look around in 2006.  According to the "research" (and I use this term lightly because someone as depressed as Ms Friedan must have had trouble seeing the happiness in others) in this book you are either: 1) WORKING MOTHER- mentally stable, able to do household tasks in lightning speed and raise completely competent children. 2)EDUCATED HOUSEWIFE- most likely on drugs and/or are alcoholic, are so depressed you contemplate suicide, have dysfunctional children and a husband who is trying to get away from your sexual advances. 3) UNEDUCATED HOUSEWIFE- content with life because you are a complete idiot.  Ms. Friedan completely ignores that there were (and there still are...) a significant percentage of women who WANT to be at home caring for their families and homes. I'm sure there were millions of women who were benefitted by being emancipated from their homes. That is good that they were happier with more choices. However, Ms. Friedan should have encouraged them to do this without dragging millions of other women thru the mud.   With her chapter on the "sexual sell:" I'm glad that she figured out people make money thru advertising by manipulating people. Advertisers manipulate everyone, not just women. And, I am sure the "thing-buying" housewife of the 1950s was nothing like the guilt-ridden working or stay at home mom today who's child has so many toys he/she doesn't know what to do except claim, "I'm bored" due to being so overwhelmed.   p. 85: Ms. Friedan quotes someone who says, "To make one half the human race consume its energies in the functions of housekeeper, wife and mother is a monstrous waste of the most precious material God ever made." The fact that Ms. Friedan would even give credit to this comment by citing it in her book speaks volumes about her mentality.   When I thought the ideas in this book couldn't get any more rediculous, Ms. Friedan started talking about homosexuality...The Feminine Mystique is driving men to be gay! Men are so repulsed by their over controlling wives and mothers that they are turning against women and "turning" homosexual! Also, Ms. Friedan thinks housewives are sex-crazed zombies in search of any man...and finally this comment: "I am convinced there is something about the housewife state itself that is dangerous. In a sense that is not as far-fetched as it sounds, the women who "adjust" as housewives, who grow up wanting to be "just a housewife" are in as much danger as the millions who walked to their own death in the concentration camp..." Is this woman serious? This stuff is so warped I can hardly put it into words!!  It is my opinion that this author was 1) extremely depressed and/or had psychological problems 2) was insanely jealous of happy wives/mothers. 
 You'll end up looking for something better.  Sound fidelity is pretty bad.  
 While the photography is stunning (by Kindra Clineff, whose name is misspelled on the cover), the text is wishy-washy and pointless. There is very little specific information on the places mentioned (history, architectural styles, etc) but rather vague inspiration for the home decorator. It's likely I'm the wrong audience for this book, but I came away from it feeling like I didn't learn anything about New England 
 This book is not a great choice. Weak plot, includes a no-interest romance and basically just stop in the middle.  Only if you have nothing else to read imho 
 This really is a disappointment.  I am a HUGE Zero 7 fan ... and their featured vocalists, however this just didn't cut it.  Sophie has a wonderful voice and is a wonderful vocalist but I do not recommend adding this CD as part of your collection 
 A book only a family member could love. Topics include: what Tom thinks of maple syrup, the Peterman catalog, and Amerigo Vespucci. Questions answered: Does Tom jog, swim, or walk? Does Tom like the new Italian restaurant near his Vermot estate? And speaking of Vermont estates: What is his happiest memory of spring? If you are hell-bent on getting answers to those burning questions, then this book is for you.  Insights range from the helpful if somewhat inane (you can change in a second, but making good on change takes commitment and time... or design matters) to the plain old whacko ("revel in life's yeastiness.")   I'm not saying there aren't good insights or that the book is a dull waste. Peters is a good storyteller with a lot of business wisdom. It's just too bad he puts neither skill to much use in this droll dress-up of dross 
 After using this book(or better trying to use this book) I've observed, after complementing the theory that is just trying to resemble Goldstein obviusly omiting most of the theory and proposing to fill those gaps with little examples.  Exercises are poorly described maybe asuming you memorize examples, very few derivations are included most is tenth grade algebra. If you are trying to learn classical mechanics try Goldstein or Landa 
 What started as a wonderfully inventive work went downhill after about the halfway point. Too many plot points depended on one character overhearing something important. I finished the book a week ago and while I remember the characters and the situations, I can't recall what happened at the end. That says something 
 If I had not read numerous books on this subject - one of the best is the `Limits to Growth' series by MIT - I would be very skeptical of Heinberg's assertions because of his obvious bias against Western Civilization.  However, after reading over a dozen books on essentially the same subject, I believe most of his assertions about the future are correct; namely that due primarily to population pressures and the necessities of civilization, the entire world is headed for an inevitable collapse.   I believe the author ruins what could have been a great book with comments such as "The Earth cannot afford rich people ..." (page 178)" and "A small minority ... [who] think critically - will gradually come to the conclusion that the entire system of industrial civilization is inherently unsustainable" (page 183).  I believe it's obvious to any serious student of history that civilization, if not requires, at least inevitably produces, wealth, i.e. "rich people", and given certain restrictions this is a good thing. And his assertion that "industrial civilization is inherently unsustainable" is patently absurd. It does seem that the current flavor of western industrial civilization, with its blind pursuit of growth at any/all costs, is headed for collapse, yet I can imagine dozens of flavors of industrial civilization which are sustainable.  On the other hand, I very much appreciated his analysis of why the real culprit, over population, is not, and will not, be discussed in any way that matters.  So if a reader can get past Heinberg's political ideology, this is a great book.  P.S. The author provides many valuable references to books and web sites. 
 My only real frame of reference is the movie with Sinatra and Brando.  Maybe not the best to campare with, even so I have to say that, with the exception of Nathan Lane and Faith Prince, the performances on the CD lacked the life I would have expected.  Maybe it's the effect he was going for as the suave, worldly gambler, but Peter Gallagher's Sky Masterson just came across as bored.  His voice was also not the quality I would have expected from a Broadway-caliber performer.  I almost hate to admit it, but I even prefer Brando's rendition of "Luck be a Lady" over the one on this CD.  The movie version of "Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat" was also far superior.  Some of "Sky's" songs (complete songs, not snippets/samples) can also be found at Peter Gallagher's web site.  I found the CD at my local library, so I avoided having to pay for the disappointment.  I would recommend you try to borrow a copy before deciding whether it's actually worth buying 
 Unlike most of the reviewers I found this book on the boring side. I think it could have been half the length, too. A lot of it was unnecessary and should have been edited better. I enjoyed The House Of Scorpion, but not this one. This book was average, nothing special and written with a lot of passive voice.  It wasn't unique. It read like many other similar books. 
 I'm changing my vote to 4 because I was a bit harsh on critiquing this book. I went through the book again and I found that the book does suit beginner anatomy really well. As another reviewer, I was turned off by the art but nonetheless it is a decent book on the subject and I recommended it to beginners and others alike.  If your looking for other good figure drawing/anatomy books, pick jack Hamm's book "Drawing the head & figure" or Andrew Loomis' "figure drawing for all it's worth" 
 Nancy helps Mr. Drew with his case concerning a rare bird farm that is scheduled to be torn down to make way for a high-rise apartment building.  The owners of the farm are being frightened with jinx signs and other symbols of bad luck.  Ooooooh!  That's so scary.  Yawwwwwwn.  This book is absolutely horrible.  The writing is terrible, the action is missing and there really isn't any mystery.  It's not like Nancy is trying to find something or even capture a gang of unknown criminals.  When you start the book you know that the people building the high-rise are the bad people.  Lots of suspense there.  This book features Nancy at her worst as she stoops so low as to use little children to get what she wants.  This is an awful book that doesn't even deserve a 1 star rating 
 I'm Still waiting even though is was bought and paid-for in Feb 06 
 I'm as big a fan of "The Adventures of the Mad Scientists' Club" and "The New Adventures of the Mad Scientists' Club" as anyone is.  I loved those books to death as a kid, and even today, as I re-read the first two books, they're still as funny and clever as I remember-- my memories are not clouded by nostalgia.  I became a scientist (for real) because of those two books.  However, "The Big Ker-Plop", despite a promising beginning, just isn't as good.  It starts out great: it's wonderful to be with the boys again as they go fishing on a foggy morning in Strawberry Lake, and somethign BIG falls from the sky and lands somewhere in the water... To be back on Strawberry Lake again with these brainy, energetic boys is terrific, and right away there's a mystery to solve.  The boys enlist the aid of Henry Mulligan to find the object that fell in the lake, and how they do it-- using some trigonometry and a magnetometer-- is described with scientific accuracy, believeable, clever and entertaining.  It's such a relief to have a plot where problems are solved by something other than Harry Potter's wand.  But after the boys tell the Air Force where they found the object, the plot seriously bogs down.  For all intents and purposes, the boys aren't really involved in the plot thereafter, except as observers and (maybe) engineers.  The boys just invent solutions to problems-- and they are clever solutions, described with scientific accuracy.  But the Air Force does all the "action", and the boys just watch them through a telescope as the adults try to retrieve the lost atomic bomb.  I understand that it's realistic that the Air Force would go after a lost atomic bomb themselves, and would not let any civilians anywhere near the site-- yes, realistic, but it makes for a boring story.  It's not fun anymore when the adults do all the work.  The adults are an important part of the story, and the adult characters are all paper-thin cliches (the good-hearted Air Force colonel, the hard-bitten reporter, the fat news photographer), uninteresting.  Brinley was a brilliant plotter, able to write plausible real-world stories with clever twists-- but he had a major defect as a writer: he loved to write "clever" dialogue full of ripostes and "witty" put-downs, which in fact were never clever or funny.  The adults do a LOT of talking in this book-- whole chapters consist of their dialogue-- and when the idiot mayor of Mammoth Falls is engaging in "clever" repartee with the barber or some other adult, the witticisms are so unfunny, it just makes me wince 
 I thought I was going to get a thriller when I first heard of this.  Instead I got a pseudo-sequel to COLD MOUNTAIN set in 1980 Texas, and I have rather low opinions of COLD MOUNTAIN.  It was difficult to follow the story due to McCarthy's decision to not only avoid using quotation marks to identify dialogue (a move I've always considered to be a pretentious affectation), but also commas, apostrophes, and proper spelling, such as not capitalizing "English" or using "livingroom" instead of "living room" and "mam" instead of "ma'am."  I don't know if this is something McCarthy does in all his books or this was a one-time deal, but it was a major turnoff and made the experience grueling rather than enjoyable.  I also didn't see the relevance of the italicized monologues of Sheriff Bell at the beginning of each chapter/section, as he tended to ramble on about life after  World War Two and how it wasn't uncommon to see 22-year-olds as ordained ministers or 25-year-olds as sheriffs of counties the size of Delaware.  Hopefully its movie adaptation (which I legitimately pity the Coen Brothers for having to wade through) is more accessible 
 Not enough thunder.  The long periods of rain sounded like static.  Dissappointing 
 Just finished reading this novel this morning and I think it is probably the weakest one of the lot.  Like a lot of reviewers, I didn't find this one anywhere near as gripping or well-developed plotwise as a number of the earlier ones in the Stephanie Plum series.  As well, the supposed sexual tension- love triangle between Stephanie, Joe and Ranger is approaching its use-by date.  It is definitely becoming boring and I think Ms Evanovich needs to resolve Stephanie's romantic situation once and for all.  I still enjoy characters like Lula and Grandma Mazur but a lot of the situations Stephanie found herself in fell flat with me.  There are only so many times she can have her car blown up, handbag destroyed, apartment broken into, etc, before it becomes tiresome and repetitive.  I still think there is a spark of life in the Stephanie Plum series, but I hope the next novel is a better effort and not so much by-the-numbers as this one 
 Clearly John Gardner is a literary genius, however not being one myself I found that his style was a little overbearing, it does not offer the inspired start to writing fiction that I was looking for.   
 This and Mad Jack were stunning dissappointments.  Where are the fiery heroines, the ones with true pluck and spirit?  Why do all of Coulter's females become bedridden at some point?  What happened to the mystery?  There was nothing fresh about this novel.  The relationship is missing the brilliant spark that is so enchanting in many of her previous works--it seems lately Coulter is marrying off her couples earlier and earlier.  This story has been done to death by Coulter.  Try the "Song" series or the early Sherbrooke brides 
 I picked up a copy of this pretentious garbage at a library used book sale. I paid one american buck for it, which was about 100 cents too much.  It's obvious from the start that Rush is extremely impressed with his massive vocabulary. Probably giggled himself to sleep each night after he finished his writings, imagining all the ignorant folks who would need the same dictionary he used to write it, in order to decipher his blather. I would recommend any of John Steinbeck's novels to any human who plowed his or her way through this dire drivel, simply to clean their mental palate. Dumpster fodder. 
 This book seems to be a good beginning tool for those not familiar at all with InDesign or who want to brush up on their skills. I purchased this book for a college course in desktop publishing and was very skeptical. I am majoring in communication design, so for the last four years I've been using InDesign. The book wasn't of much help for someone like myself who's been using the software for sometime. Therefore I don't recommend the book for anyone who's familiar with InDesign.   The CD that accompanies the book is a great learning tool (meaning it's good if you've never used InDesign). However it is filled with errors. I've encountered several errors in the exercises that make it very difficult for beginners. I'm sure there's a better book on the market that will teach InDesign in a more effective, error free way.   So, to conclude... look for a different book. This one is full of way too many irritating errors 
 I was not into this movie at all.  My mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through.  A middle-aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life, so he takes a dance class.  Ofcourse there's a fine dance instructor, a crush is pursued, a wife gets jealous, hires a detective, and *gasp* his crush is found out.  The movie was too predictable and it just wasn't for me.  Not a bad movie, just not my cup of tea.  Richard Gere was cute as usual, which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end, besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since "So You Think You Can Dance" never had contestants who mastered it 
 We opened 2 Razor Bumper Buggy's for Hanukkah that we got as gifts from a family member.  Both of them were missing the charger for the battery (and other hardware), so our kids couldn't even play with them.  They were very disappointed.  What is worse, Razor's customer service is TERRIBLE!  They would not send us the missing chargers without a receipt.  Of course, since they were gifts, we didn't have the reciept.  Razor refused to help us until we could get proof of purchase from a credit card statement, which won't be for a couple of weeks.  Then of course it will take a couple more weeks to actually get the chargers.  All this hassle, all the hours on the phone, when they could have just sent us the missing chargers, like any decent company would for such a high price item!    Our poor kids, just looking at their motionless bumper cars.  Of course, we can't actually review whether the prodcut is any good or not until sometime in Februrary when we actually get to use it.    Happy Hanukkah to you too, Razor 
 When Professor Polk describes the sweep of history in Iraq, he is at his best, but the book often descends into a political diatribe that is neither appropriate nor grounded in the facts.  Much of the political ranting is supposition, marring what would otherwise be an interesting and informative work. The ranting gets especially tedious towards the end.  My advice, read the first part and skip the last half 
 Hey Rhino compilation geniuses: What about including edited versions of Eumir Deodato's "Also Sprach Zharatustra", and MFSB's "The Sound of Philadelphia (TSOP)"???... C'mon...!!!!  
 foul. just plain foul. seemingly never-ending..and not in a good way. tasteless. sick. not even worth the beautiful faces. Heck, I can't even write a proper review because I refused to finish the worthless trash-couldn't tell you what it was about. 
 You Got Served was a horrible misrepresentation of what the b-boy scene is actually like and this instructional video pushes that misrepresentation even further. If you want to learn to breakdance buy the Breakdance step-by-step dvd released by bboy.org or any of the films in the Breakvision series 
 The companion web site mentioned in the book is not there. When I typed in that URL, I got redirected to Peachpit's advertising site of this book, but no "links", "tools", nor "examples" mentioned in the book at all! 
 After anticipating the arrival of this book (that I ordered some time before publication after hearing of it), I was disappointed.  Although the subject is timely, the writing style smacks of academia and therefore, will not appeal to the mainstream (reader).  Because I'm tenacious by nature, I finished the book, but found my mind wandering throughout because it simply did not hold my attention.  Too bad - it could have been inspirational 
 This book functions primarily as a large advertisement for the author's seminars/classes. Most of what the book presents is naive, simplistic or just plain wrong. The financial side techniques presented include "tried and true" goodies that don't work now and didn't work when I first read them in a book my dad bought 40 years ago.   The negotiating tactics don't work. See Spin Selling for some of the best sales and negotiating material out there.   Of course, if you are able to deal only with people who are completely ignorant of the real estate values in their town and who distrust lawyers, i.e., don't have contracts reviewed in lieu of using a real estate broker, you may get some of these gems to work for you.  And what do I know? Not much -- but I have appeared in court as an expert appraisal witness, made a few million in real estate (& yes, I still read books. Who knows when I'll find a good idea?) and been a real estate broker for 30 years.  The author, if he ever made any money in real estate, is now, it would seem, making his money selling his seminars. Run, don't walk, away from the author and his materials. 
 This is a gadget with more promise than delivery. It was a retirement gift to me and I'm sure glad that not a penny from my pocket went toward the purchase. Difficult to operate and the end product is not worth the trouble. You have been warned 
 Very disappointing.Disjointed effort on behalf of a McCourt nephew. Seems  more like a school project rather than the touching journal that resulted  in Angela's Ashes. Some frames are out of focus(not an effect). Too much  focus on Malachy, not even-handed. Turned a well-intentioned story into a  drudgery. Not even enough photos that would have made the difference 
 The foundation of success in a horror story is a strong, original beginning.  The author must grab your attention and earn your suspension of disbelief.  Dean Koontz failed to make this upfront investment in The Taking.  The story caroms off of a long series of hackneyed horror elements - stormy night, body snatchers, magic mirrors, ghouls, and (Koontz's favorite) Delphic dogs - before settling down with a very modest storyline about a non-denominational rapture.    Koontz can usually be counted on to deliver some pleasant thrills or humor if not the chills of real horror.  But The Taking provides no such return 
 Powell's analysis takes place in an economic vacuum, where all Americans had to do was wait out the four years of economic collapse, and the roaring twenties would have reappeared. The simple truth is that Roosevelt and the New Deal saved capitalism (that out to set off some of you, I'm sure). By 1933, capitalism had fallen into disrepute; only by regulating its excesses, and providing a safety net for its victims, is a part of it in existence today 
 I read this book two months ago and I just woke up now.   Yeah, yeah, I know: 0 out of X people found this review helpful 
 I had to read this book for a women's psychology class. After finishing it I checked the internet to see what real archaeologists had to say on the topic. It turns out that this book is a (...). It is filled with conclusions that have no basis in archaeological or scientific reality. Many of Gimbutas's assertions have been discredited. Like Von Daniken, Graham Hancock, and other con artists who write about ancient astronauts, the "face" on mars, or the lost continent of Atlantis, this author has written the worst type of parapsychological and pseudohistorical bunk. If she truly wants to promote equality in the world, and not just make a fast buck, writing a bunch of garbage and trying to pass it off as history is not the way to do it 
 "Folks tend to believe that this kind of terminology [structure, form or plot] means writing by some type of formula or predetermined format as rigid as a paint-by-numbers portrait. Nothing could be further from the truth."  The problem is that this book is a complete paint-by-numbers kind of book, it teaches you to write common novels, novels that say nothing new. He states that is a lot better for the author, because once you understand the structure, you can be free to be creative in other things... What other things!? After all the rules he tells you to follow, there is little space to be creative...  According to this man, the reader is an idiot. He says that you must begin every scene with a clear statement of goal ("most of the time, the character states his immediate goal in obvious, unmistakable fashion"), and that the character must SAY it, and make it VERY CLEAR for the reader. Can't the reader understand the objective of the character without him saying: "Hey, reader, listen to me, I'm running from the killers because I don't want to be murdered! Got it? OK? Fine, then you know that my objective is not to be murdered!"?   Follow this and you find yourself in problems. I was in problems following it.   Damn, how the hell I am going to leave something to be surprising in the end if every action most have and inmediate reaction?   How can I hide a character's secret agenda if every character must state his goal clearly from the begginning of a scene?  If the protagonist must end in a worse situation with every scene for the book to be interesting, how does he explain the success of "First Blood", where is stated in every page that the protagonist will triumph over the cops?  Or what about the DaVinci Code, where the good guys are ALLWAYS a lot of steps ahead the bad guys?   How can I show scenes between the bad guys if this man tells me we must stick with the protagonist and his inmediate reactions to change all the time?   He NEVER adresses this kind of things.  
 A shallow treatment of shallow characters with shallow values... A waste of time. 
 I gave this to my kid for christmas, and he never opened it until today. But the bad news it doesn't work on any of the players we have at home. It clearly says on the cover SACD surround sound "Plays only on". wow. I never heard of that. Any suggestions? It doesn't say that it requires a special player on the ad. Very disappointed 
 It was acceptable for the price paid, but very little jumped out at me as being terribly useful.  I thought the penny-pinching techniques went a little too far into the ridiculous.  If you follow some of this advice you will waste a lot of time saving a little bit of money 
 the only reason I got this book is because it was in the Oprah's book club. I was sorely dissapointed. The story felt slow and disjointed to me. And my prevailing feeling at the end was "so what". That it was supposed to be a love story did not interest me. The sentiments expressed did not move me at all, it seemed very ordinary, almost everyday. But who knows, probably an everyday, ordinary sort of life story is what some people want to read so they can identify with- god forbid 
 A good example of why you would go to the library or bookstore and see if the book was any good, prior to purchasing. Specifically, author hits a  wide range of topics and delves into little. The book lacks summaries and  lacks a general direction. Some nice photos, which probably resulted in the  excessive price. Save your money 
 ...like vomit.  The overall layout is chaotic and busy.  The content is greatly lacking.  Few "how-to's" are actually included in the book, and those that are are not detailed enough to follow.  Included at the end of each section is page or two of randomly spaced and fonted words that are supposed to be a list of possible sources of material and inspiration for the preceeding section.  Unfortunately, most of the entries are rather mundane.  More useful would be an expanded "how-to" section using examples from these lists.  Further more, one of the reasons I purchased the book, "crayon transfers," is not actually described.  I much prefer Claudine Hellmuth's two inspiring and helpful books on the same subject.  
 I really wanted to like this phone from all the good reviews, but received one with issues, returned it and received another with the same issues; so it must be the phone model.  The below items do not involve using the handset speakerphone feature which requires a "wait for you" "wait for me" behavior; just normal handset.  -When you first answer an incoming call, you usually have to wait a few seconds for the phone to make available 2 way converstion; otherwise, you can say hello and the caller can't hear you and you can't hear them.  -During a call using normal handset, background noise and even regular conversation can cause the phone to block the volume of the caller as though you are using the speakerphone feature when you're actually not. After a few seconds the volume will become audible again. This issue causes bits and pieces of the conversation to go unheard. This happens more on long distance calls than on local calls 
 As others have mentioned already, I found this thing to be very, very "wobbly".   I never, ever felt comfortable riding with my (almost 4-year-old) son on this thing. It just felt too unstable.  I returned this after only a few days
