 I purchase this instrument twice.  The first time there were black specks in the lense, so it was returned.  The second time was worst, i.e. same black specs but the thing didn't work at all.  I have also checked this manufacturer's other models out and most come with the disturbing black specks in the lense.  This isn't a quality optical product 
 ...but every song on the album sounds the same. And I happen to like them. Disappointed 
 "A Consumers' Republic" is one of those kinds of books that exists on the premise that it illuminates some previously unknown phenomenon. The book purports to be a "bold, encompassing, and profoundly influential book."  I humbly propose that this book is none of the above. "A Consumers' Republic" is certainly not a "bold" book. Quite tepidly, actually, the author makes a weak case that is essentially a rehashing (and a mediocre one at that) of mainstream academic criticisms of popular market culture. Certianly nothing new, the ideas lamely presented by this author were actually prefigured by a factor of centuries by actual scholars such as Smith, Marx, and de Toqueville. Not bold for sure, but also lacking nuance; "A Consumers' Republic" condescends to its readers and its subjects alike.  And is this book "profoundly influential," as the jacket pompously asserts? I hope not

 I bought this mascara based on a review I read on Amazon. Maybe it's just me, but I still find that my lashes "clump" or stick together with this product. It might be the Navy color. I don't think its worth the extra cost - I do just as well with drugstore mascara 
 I bow to my colleagues who have observed Manchester's acquired taste for the MacArthurian mystique and the apparent failures of historians (not just Willam M.) on getting it right regarding The General's ego and its fallout in combat. Yes this stuff is significant, but all this overlooks one outstanding reality, that Manchester includes but does give the proper emphasis: Doug MacArthur wanted to be president, very, very badly.  He truly saw himself as a caesar-like figure in history and positioned himself in returning to the Philipines, administering post-war Japan, and taking the baton in Korea (at the age of 70) for a return to the US in "triumph."  Instead he bowed out after being fired by Truman, who had nothing to lose by relieving him. This book is an enormous achievement, necessary for a student of modern history, but Manchester misses a golden opportunity to build a dramatic effect when giving the account of the final years of MacArthur's public life by passing over these events and not leaning on their true meaning 
 Am I the only person in the world who didn't know that all Wee Sing stuff is religious. Okay - maybe I live under a rock, but when I pick up a cd/book package for kids that says "Silly Songs & Finger Plays", and has NO mention anywhere on the packaging or in the titles of the songs about Christianity or religion, I hope I can assume that the book is just a bunch of funny songs meant to entertain, not subliminally teach Christianity to my 4 year old! We are a secular family and teach our children to respect all religions and cultures. We would rather they didn't go about singing songs that made them sound Christian (or Buddhist or anything else for that matter.) "Abraham, Isaac and Jacob went to Jericho. Maybe they should have gone to Amsterdam." - thus goes a song titled "Three Jolly Fishermen". What's that supposed to mean??? I'm sure this is a great CD/book set if you are a practising Christian. The publisher should get responsible and mention the religious bent on the packaging for those consumers who are not 
 This book is well written and serves as a good primer for those interested in learning more about the history of China and the life and work of Zhou Enlai. That said, Han Suyin's work is at times whimsical in its description of the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party. One gets the idea that she was commissioned by the party to produce it: Not a word is written on Zhou Enlai's involvement in the swift and widespread brutality visited by Mao upon millions of his detractors and alleged detractors. 
 Since I've read and enjoyed an earlier book by these authors (Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps) I didn't hesitate to grab this one off the shelves. What a waste of money! They just repeat a lot that was said in the book I already had. Also, of all the "facts" that are stated I know for sure that at least three of them are total fiction or at best hearsay (these are the only three where I'm an expert) which seriously makes me doubt the validity of the remaining facts. I found this book a very irritating read. 
 This movie could have been summed up in 30 minutes. I fell asleep several times trying to get through it, good sleep aid, not such a great film. I had way higher expectations from watching the other AMAZING Miyazaki films. This movie isn't a bad edition to Miyazaki's portfolio, but it's not even close to his best 
    "Battle For God"  by Karen Armstrong  "But I mean no harm nor put fault On anyone that lives in a vault,..."  --Bob Dylan  from "It's alright Ma (I'm only bleeding)"                  **** TRY TO BE ME FOR A MOMENT... ****        Try to be me for a moment. I pick up a book...it doesn't 'feel' right. So I start thinking. There is no mention of the American Civil War. No mention of Henry Ward Beecher, the abolitionist. No mention of the abolitionist movement, which was a FUNDAMENTALIST movement in both England & America.        There is no mention of the fundamentalist BEECHER family and it's support of the early Women's Rights Movement and the BEECHER friendship with  suffragist  Susan B. Anthony.  No mention of the friendship between Mark Twain and the Beecher family,  in whose home Twain was a frequent guest.         Then I find that there is only a brief mention of the U. S. Constitution in Chapter Three. I also notice that Armstrong seems to have a different view of social "ills" than ordinary people. Fundamentalism is identified as a social ill; but it is highly convenient to depart from reality (if you are an author) when you don't acknowledge crime, violence, poverty, etc etc as social ills.       Then Armstrong gives a brief mention  (a single sentence!) of Oliver Cromwell and the English Civil War, in which PURITANS, by any definition, a fundamentalist sect, played a prominent role.        Five stars go to books that are fun, or useful, or highly informative. Armstrong's book might have been informative, but whether consciously or unconsciously, it reads more like piece of New Age literature. At any rate, it is not a scholarly work of history. No genuine scholar would ever be guilty of such comprehensive historical ommissions,  or   omissions of facts of law,   or  just plain IRRATIONALITY.          ***   WHAT THE AUTHOR DID ****            Here is what Karen Armstrong has done with  history. She omits  (1) the history of slavery,  and (2) the American Civil War.  (3)  The English Civil War (1642-1649)  and (4) The Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution,  and along with it, the First Amendment clause granting freedom of religion. What Armstrong does with Fundamentalism is to stretch the focus of her study beyond all scope and boundary, to eventually indict all of religion,  obscuring the distinction between religion generally,  and  FUNDAMENTALISM specifically.   The work is unscholarly because the omissions are nothing short of horrific,  and biased   because  the historical omissions create a false and misleading view of events from which erroneous conclusions are extrapolated.     Armstrong suggests that a just and righteous segment of European and American society, termed "Scientific Rationalists"   having possesion of  moral clarity,   have always  borne silent witness to the abuses of ignorant and frightened religious fanatics as they wreak havoc upon the societies in Europe and America.  Armstrong calls the religious fanatics, "Fundamentalists".    Examine this quote:   "...by the middle of the ninetheenth century the new secularist United States had become a passionately Christian nation. During the 1780s, and still more in the 1790s, the churches all experienced new growth and began to counter the Enlightenment ideology of the Founding Fathers. They now sacralized the American independence: the new republic, they argued, was God's achievement. The revolutionary battle had been the cause of heaven against hell." --p. 85 bottom paragraph, "Battle for God"   [This quote serves as an example of Armstrong failing to make a clear distinction between religion, generally, as distinct from FUNDAMENTALISM. This failing is an integral part of Armstrong's "history".  Notice how Armstrong is critical of the "CHRISTIAN" faith,  not a "FUNDAMENTALIST" sect within the context of Christian faith.  Throughout Armstrong's writing,  it is clear that FUNDAMENTALISM is not the subject;  but rather, RELIGION  in its most general sense is the subject, as this quote shows.  That is not good "scholarship"  and it isn't even merely a case of "sloppy" scholarship.  It is not scholarship in any sense at all.  It is however a prime example of historical revisionism.]     ****  OMISSION  OF   ENGLISH CIVIL WAR 1642-1649/  The PURITANS ***     Charles I of England,  spent lavishly on luxuries, and when the Puritans  protested his enforcement of  religious reforms,  Charles I had their ears amputated and their noses slit.  Charles I demanded  more money from Parliament, and upon  refusal,  closed the House of Lords & House of Commons,  precipitating the English Civil War,  1642-1649.  Oliver Cromwell,  prominent amongst Puritans,  raised a core militia of Puritan farmers and being an unexpectedly shrewed general,  brought victory for the common people.       Oliver Cromwell declined an offer to become King,  and struggled with some democratic ideal.  Our understanding today,  of a government of  three branches:  Executive, Judicial, and Legislative,  was only an obscure dream in the mid 17th Century.  Cromwell led England well as Lord Protector until his death.  The Monarchy was restored,  and many Puritans fled to America,  energizing the American drive toward a successful democratic model of government, including Constitutional guarantees against "cruel and unusual punishments".      Armstrong  mentions  fundamentalism in the context of Puritan Oliver Cromwell with a single sentence on page 75.  Notwithstanding,  even in the INTRODUCTION to "Battle for God"  Armstrong is critical of "fundamentalists" for not regarding conflict as some kind of  "a conventional political struggle". [see page xi, paragraph 1].  Well for the fundamentalists,  persecution was not part of "...a conventional political struggle."  It is easy for Armstrong to make such criticism,  because Armstrong is so cunning in her historical omissions,  that nobody need let the facts  get in the way of a generalized indictment of  Fundamentalism. Neither does Armstrong bother mentioning Charles I in the context of his tyranny over the English people.  She just broadly and generally indicts fundamentalists for not engaging in "...a conventional political struggle."  The fact that nobody in the 17th Century is engaging in  a "...conventional political struggle"  is a mute point because of this convenient omission.   *** OMISSION of SLAVERY & AMERICAN CIVIL WAR/  The ABOLITITIONISTS  ***   The omission of the history of slavery is convenient for Armstrong. That is how she can bend history to make it appear that "Scientific Rationalists" provided moral leadership in Europe & America and initiated necessary social change. In this sense, Armstrong strongly suggests that Scientific Rationalists are possessed of the superior qualities of human development, empowered by a compassionate heart, empowered by deeper insight into life's ultimate nature, and in fact, just as intwined in MYTHOS as the Fundamentalists that they so sharply reduce to spiritual primitives. It is more of a contradiction of actual history.   Fundamentalists are responsible for the ABOLITION movement however. The COMMITTEE FOR THE ABOLITION OF THE SLAVE TRADE was formed in England in 1787. The fundamentalists campaigned through public meetings, pamphlets and petition. This religious movement was eventually to reach the United States where fundamentalists also advocated the abolition of slavery. No mention whatsoever of this fundamentalist movement is mentioned in Armstrong's "Battle for God" nor does this "history" include the American Civil War. According to the author's dating outline, The American Civil War ought to have been in Chapter 3; but it is omitted, and they call this a 'scholarly' work?     ******REVEREND  LYMAN BEECHER's FAMILY of Litchfield, Connecticut"  *****      A most prominent omission in "Battle for God"  concerns the Puritan family  of Rev. Lyman Beecher, whose daughter,  "Harriet Beecher Stowe,"  wrote the  novel,  "UNCLE TOM's CABIN"  which inspired many Americans to reject the very idea  of  slavery.  It is Armstrong's omission of the role of the Puritans in the English Civil War,   and the American Abolitionist movement,   to  distort the role of religion in American History.        Again,  it is a problem of not making  a clear distinction between FUNDAMENTALISM and RELIGION generally.   Although the precise term,  "FUNDAMENTALIST" did not appear before the 19th Century,  the same doctrinal beliefs were in place;   for example,  Biblical literalism,  etc.  Reverend Beecher's family was Calvinist. Let's look at this family  to see how complex American religion is and how clear lines of distinction are confusing.       There is an account of Henry Ward Beecher,  who at about age seven,  walked by an Episcoplian Church in December,  1820. He was fascinated by the candles blazing in every window,  the boughs of spruce,  pine,   and arborvitae around each pew,  and a church choir singing joyfully the news of Christ's birth.  But Rev. Lyman Beecher's church had never engaged in Christmas celebration nor Christmas Carols,  for he was an orthodox CALVINIST,  and interpreted the Bible "literally".   For elder Beecher,  the decorations were gaudy, and dancing and theater were forbidden.  Rev. Lyman Beecher,  Henry Ward Beecher's father was the last great  PURITAN  minister in America.  His children grew up with the teaching that the devil roamed the earth and bad people would burn in the fires of hell forever.       "Christmas...was not known in the house of my father,  for he was a Puritan of the Puritans." --Henry Ward Beecher,   CU,  3 January 1872      Rev. Lyman Beecher's wife and 8 children started each day,  and ended each and every day,  with  prayer and  Bible reading.           ****  BUT WERE THE CALVINISTS OF  CONNECTICUT,  "fundamentalists"? ***       True,  the term "fundamentalist" is a 20th Century category,  but scholars even now have difficulty classifying sects as such.     Does the Calvinist Beecher family  strike you as FUNDAMENTALIST?  Consider what  contemporary RALPH WALDO EMERSON had to say on the matter:      "It is yet in all men's memory that,   a few years ago,  the LIBERAL churches complained that the Calvinistic Church denied to them the name of Christian."--"New England Reformers,"   a lecture read in Amory Hall,  Sunday,  3 March  1844 by RALPH WALDO EMERSON          ***** WHO DOES FIT ARMSTRONG's  STEREOTYPE?  ***       Wife of Rev. Lyman Beecher,  Roxana Foote  Beecher was a skilled artist,  an intellectual,  spoke good French,  and had a passion for history,  math and science. Of her children,  Isabella Beecher Hooker  was a women's rights activist.  These women,  Calvinists,  do not fit Armstrong's definition of "fundamentalist".   Moreover,  frequent guests in the home included suffragist  Susan B. Anthony and the irreverent author  Mark Twain.            Why did President Lincoln,  arguably the greatest American President,  choose the son of Reverend Lyman Beecher,  Henry Ward Beecher,  to deliver a commemorative speech at the raising of the Union Flag at Fort Sumter South Carolina,  the very spot where the Civil War had begun in April 1861?   Henry Ward Beecher was not the most radical abolitionist in the North;  but he did pursuade  many thousands of Americans to believe that slavery  was ungodly and unchristian, and must be purged from the nation.  Henry Ward Beecher turned his massive church into  a vital antislavery institution;  the leaven in the American lump.       On Good Friday,  14 April 1865,  Henry Ward Beecher spoke for over an hour at Ft. Sumter, South Carolina. So, did he rail,  rant, and condemn?  Hardly!  Beecher's speech said essentially,  "But for the people misled, for the multitudes drafted and driven into this civil war,  LET NOT A TRACE OF ANIMOSITY REMAIN."  So where is the "paranoia" and the hate characteristic of the Fundamentalists?         The point is,  that FUNDAMENTALISTS in America,  studied in the context of our actual history,  are the  apex of the national character.  This is the Puritan Legacy.       Where are the Scientific Rationalists in all of this?  The impressions are so confusing that you could reasonably assert that the religious people ARE the Scientific Rationalists. That is why by omitting the American Civil War,  Armstrong can offer an amputated American History of religion and make it look appealing.  Civil War Historian,  Shelby Foote claimed that the Civil War was the single event that defined the American character, and I support that idea.              All of this  might add up and make sense, this intellectuality,   Biblical Literalism,  Puritanism,  Calvanism,  combined with irreverence,  women's rights activism and suffragettes, and abolitionist politics,  if it is considered within the context of American history;  but....Armstrong simply omits this history altogether.  How can any history of American religion be undertaken and not include the abolitionist movement, which by its very  essentials is a FUNDAMENTALIST, and not,  a Scientific Rationalist event?                 ******   "DEEPER LEVELS  OF THE MIND" (or HAVING YOUR CAKE AND EATING IT TOO ) *****  [the quote from page 75]       "Thousands of men and women convicted of witchcraft were either hanged or burned at the stake before the craze burned itself out.  The new scientific rationalism, which took no cognizance of these deeper levels of the mind,   was powerless to control this hysterical outburst." p.75 "Battle For God"         "Scientific Rationalists" had   "...no cognizance of these deeper levels of the mind."    For that matter,  virtually nobody had much "...cognizance of these deeper levels of the mind."    Armstrong is implying that by "deeper levels"  leading to a deepest level,   there is a TRANSCENDENT level of mind,  which could even lend itself to being termed God.    In fact,  by way of the Platonic MYTHOS,  any model of MIND is a useful spiritual conveyance. This would include MYTHOS models inclusive of a Fundamentalist Kingdom of Heaven,  etc. or even claim that Christ is the perfect embodiment of LOGOS/MYTHOS altogether.  Is that just cause for  criticism of the religious outlook on "...deeper levels of the mind"?        A clear confirmation that Armstrong uses MYTHOS in a context that is contrary to the prevailing views of Scientific Rationalism is to be found in another review of "Battle for God" giving Armstrong 5 stars and a round endorsemnt. It says this about  Armstrongs adoption of Mythos for Scientific Rationalism,  while excluding Fundamentalists from any right to MYTHOS.      "...one can never separate the conscious and unconscious in any permanent way. Her explanation of logos and mythos draws immediate parallels to the real and unreal, the seen and the unseen, the rational and the subconscious, the physical and metaphysical. Western technology induces eastern spirituality much the way the visible requires an analysis of the forces behind the visible." --from a 5 STAR review of "Battle for God"      What is wrong with this claim?  It is a contradiction of the SCIENTIFIC RATIONALIST adherence to a strict EMPIRICISM.  Scientific Rationalists do not  affirm an Eastern Spirituality,  nor ANY spirituality,  no more than they endorse a New Age Mythos.   Philosophers call  this a LIVED CONTRADICTION:  What we deny in our words,  we presuppose in our living.  Scientific Rationalism seeks for PHYSICAL causes for human behavior,  not MYTHOLOGICAL causes. MYTHOS and Scientific Rationalism are ANTI-THETICAL.      The difficulty is that Armstrong allows for herself,  and for Scientific Rationalism  generally,  a great liberality in boundary and scope.  She allows herself  freedom to explore MYTHOS and affirm it with  conviction and historical justification.   In a contradictory manner,  Armstrong is critical of fundamentalists, for reasons that they prefer models deriving from Biblical MYTHOS. Is that fair?  Why are Fundamentalists to be deprived of their MYTHOS, while Scientific Rationalists are entitled to a MYTHOS that they deny in nearly every document and  book they author?  This is a clear violation of the Law of Non-Contradiction, or, in plain words,  it cannot be denied,  and then affirmed,  at the same time. Religion is either valid or invalid,  and Scientific Rationalist go to great lengths to deny the validity of religion. Religion is a form of MYTHOS.       That is probably why Armstrong  omits all but a passing reference  to the U.S. Bill of Rights,  because it is a Constitutional guarantee of religious freedom. [see p. 85]       ******   LOGOS & MYTHOS  and Misrepresentation of Fact  ***     Plato's  Logos  & Mythos is used by Armstrong to characterize the ancient duality of  PHYSICS & METAPHYSICS. Our Subjective side of life, i.e. [ "deeper levels of the mind" ] Religion, inclusive of Fundamentalism,  would fall in the category of MYTHOS. Consider  how Armstrong characterizes MYTHOS in modern life with a misrepresentation of fact as follows.      "Because of the dearth  of myth in our modern society,  we have had to evolve the science of psychoanalysis to help us deal with our inner   world."  --bottom of page xiii to top of p. xiv,  INTRODUCTION,  "Battle for God"     This is a generally false statement.  Psychoanalysis is highly interpretive, and not a core science either.  It basically died a long time ago.  Psychotherapy generally is a highly diversified field, including even POP-PSYCHOLOGY,  hardly a science at all.  Psychotropic drugs have pushed psychoanalysis to the periphery of science.  Finally,  I do not like the misrepresentation of Psychologists as practitioners of some kind of  role as   DELPHIC ORACLE,  PRIEST,  SHAMAN, REIKI MASTER,     or quasi religious authority figure,   guiding souls through a labyrinth  of  spiritual symbols, to reach  "...deeper levels of the mind..."  when the latter  does not even qualify in any context as part of the SCIENTIFIC RATIONALISM that Armstrong endorses elsewhere in her book. This is not only an Orwellian nightmare,  but also  a clear contradiction of fact.      This is also why it is so important that Armstrong qualify the meaning of her ideas concerning,  "...deeper levels of the mind."   Scientific Rationalists operate with such a double standard.  It's as though they deny that God or Heaven exist in any phenomenological sense whatsoever,  reject moralizations,  but then turn right around and suggest that something of the sort does exist,   and moreover,  claim  that PSYCHOANALYSTS   know what it is really all about, this MIND-MAZE or MIND-LABYRINTH,  and can classify precisely where every person is on his spiritual journey into Mythological symbolism.  Certainly,  Scientific Rationalists desire that ordinary religious people have no claim on  the  Heavens,  or "deeper levels of the mind."          *** ARMSTRONG's  PEDANTIC CRITICISM and the FAILURE TO IDENTIFY GOOD & EVIL  ***[the quote from page 85]     Observing this  author  attempt to impose a personal and vague morality upon the American people by implying that American church members have violated some obscure standard of GOOD & EVIL is ridiculous. In fact,  Armstrong fails to identify the standard of Good & Evil she upholds. It is not American Constitutional Law, I assure you.       Examine this quote:     "...by the middle of the ninetheenth century the new secularist United States had become a passionately Christian nation.  During the 1780s,  and still more in the 1790s,  the churches all experienced new growth and began to counter the Enlightenment ideology of the Founding Fathers.  They now sacralized the American independence:  the new republic,  they argued,  was God's  achievement.  The revolutionary battle had been the cause of heaven against hell." --p. 85  bottom paragraph, "Battle for God"           [This quote serves as an example of Armstrong failing to make a clear distinction between religion, generally,   as distinct from FUNDAMENTALISM.  This failing  is an integral part of Armstrong's  "history".]   NO credible author,  in any field of endeavour today,  would ever refer to America as a "Christian" nation.  The "nation"  has no national religion. That's the result of  the First Amendment's prohibition of the national Congress from passing legislation based upon religion.   This is one more example where Armstrong is entirely out of depth as a historian, and worse,  she has not acquainted herself with the most definitive document of the nation,  which is the U.S. Constitution.           How the church members interpreted the American Revolution is of no consequence.  ALL people interpret their experience.  The only matter of consequence is that they  supported the American Revolution and the Constitution.  Armstrong implies a standard  of GOOD & EVIL exists here,  by which religious people ought to be  rejected. It is a  subversion of Constitutional law at best,  and an inversion of genuine morality, at worst and it is  entirely a pedantic exercise. Sometimes,  the tail tries to "Wag the Dog."    The Bill of Rights is only mentioned on p. 85 in the entire book, and from this, readers may fairly deduce that Armstrong is virtually not at all concerned with regligious freedoms in America.  Indeed, the quote from p. 85 suggests that Armstrong is overly pedantic.  This quote justifies an earlier Amazon reviewer's observation that Armstrong's remarks are INTERPRETIVE,  in the manner of Literary Criticism, rather than as a History.      The point of quoting p. 85 however is to demonstrate that Armstrong omits any concern  for crime,  poverty,  disease,  vice,  or even   immorality in some general sense in American life.  These are not Social Ills worthy of concern.  No,  Armstrong is critical of some American citizens, who in their churches,  have the audacity to engage in interpretive views of their own,  and choose to believe that God is interactive in the daily life of America.  Well, how dare those Fundamentalists do such a thing!  By the same standard,  you could persecute a Feng Shui practitioner, for making interpretive judgements about invisible forces inside our homes.      For exercising a Constitutional right,  American citizens,   come under Armstrong's pedantic criticism. She accuses the religious of "...countering the Enlightenment ideology of the Founding Fathers."       The darker implication is made obvious,  when readers realize that Armstrong is not merely opposing Freedom of Religion;  but  going further still,  to threaten Freedom of Thought.    Ah,  the THOUGHT-POLICE arrive,  and Armstrong's  Scientific Rationalism is beginning to look like fascism I fear.         Remember: One lie does not cost you one truth but the truth." ---Christian Freidrich Hebbel             
 Not my cup a tea. Poor sound and average picture. Just for Excalibur freaks...?! 
 When I picked up this book I had high expectations,seeing that it had received good reviews.It opened quite spectacularly as well, on a rather surreal note.But as I read on, I couldn't help wondering what the point was in this rather incoherent, rambling tale.The book seemed like a sloppy, haphazard collection of incidents that didn't make much sense or assist character development. The central character herself was unbelievable and I found it impossible to identify with her or understand her actions or even sympathise with her plights.It seems to me that the writer had tried too hard to create a hip,cutting edge story and the end product was strained and gimmicky. Some incidents were quite mirth-provoking, however,that's why I gave it two stars 
 I used this book twice in two different classes, and it simply repeats everything one can find in a $20 creative writing book.  The readings selected are lackluster or horribly common in creative writing books already.    If this book were even $30, the content would not be so reprehensible.  However, with the hefty price tag, the pages should be littered with helpful tips that are new and exclusive to this book.  Burroway's "Imaginative Writing" is just as boring and hollow, but it at least does not gouge the pocket.   I would reccomend not buying this book if one is looking for a creative writing book.  Instead, check out "The First Five Pages" or "30 most common mistakes of Fiction Writers," both of which rest comfortably under the $20 marker.  For those who are required to use this book for a class, either don't buy it or purchase an earlier edition 
 While the story line was tolerable and interesting at times, the preachiness of 'educating the reader' about the favorite 'special interest' of the author really comes across to clumsily that it detracts from the overall flow of the book (every few pages there seems to be a jab here and there thrown in to meet some sort of a PSA quota.)  The story line is not as good as Toxin, but this title is slightly less offensive in the constant regurgitation of the 'healthcare system= evil' message than it is in Toxin 
 This is one of the silliest books I have read for a long time. It could be categorised as belonging  to the same genre of "action fantasy" as a number of Hollywood films.  Examples of the rules of reality being abandoned:  The action takes place in the middle of Antarctic winter, and the author even notes at one point how it's pitch dark outside, yet there are scenes on the ice that play out as if the characters could see each other.  People spend minutes in freezing water, yet pop out none the worse for the wear.  Two close allies of the United States attack a US installation on no better motivation than a claim that a "spaceship" has been found there, shouted once through the radio.  A 12-year-old girl goes through hours of commando troops shooting at each other in a closed facility without getting hurt physically, nor, apparently, mentally.  A prototype airplane that has been buried in ice for over ten years, but that works perfectly on the first attempt to fly it.  The stupidity goes on and on, but that's perhaps enough to give a taste. There are perhaps people who do not care about any of this, but I don't enjoy books whose author doesn't have one bit of interest in any sort of realism 
 This was a hot mess, it was so boring I couldn't even finish the book, I passed it on to my cusion, and she said the same thing, I just gave the book away. My hopes were all high from Flyy Gryl, but thats the only good book that Omar written. I was so upset by this that I actually wanted to write Omar Tyree myself and ask him what the hell was going on. I mean when you write a bad book chances are that no one is going to want to read the next book. I hate reading a bad book because I feel it is just a waist of my time, and I could've done somthing better. Omar, you owe my 4 hours of a good book 
 Inspired by his uncle, Eddie, who worked at an amusement park, Albom writes a well-coordinated tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife, which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience. The concept is old: a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths. There are concepts to be learned from the five people. The story is delightful and cavalier.

 It's no surprise that the contributors (and most reviewers) of JESUS UNDER FIRE have done their hardest to undermine the extensive research and scholarship of The Jesus Seminar. Their attacks on the seminar read as if no one involved in the Seminar ever believed that Jesus was the Son of God. But that method fits quite well into the Christian Right's "kill the messenger" common tactic when they can't accept reasonable disagreement - - even when we all want the same thing. Rather than acknowledging the possibility that the true message of Jesus Christ is found in the value of a modern interpretation of His words and deeds that would truly resonante with all Christians, they prefer to accept every word in the Gospel as His, notwithstanding the obvious inconsistencies in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Isn't it about time we all start getting back to what the Sermon on the Mount means to each of us in our lives today? And I'm sure the negative comments, if not threats, I'll receive for this review from many readers will demonstrate their magnanimous "Christian" attitudes. The book is still worthwhile reading, however, to explore the well-reasoned and critical responses to The Jesus Seminar findings. Whichever view you adopt, you can't be wrong; each one adequately establishes sufficient reasons to have faith in Jesus. 
 If people of influence and those aspiring to such a position want to ensure that the poor stay poor and wilful manipulation of trade is the norm, this book by Joseph E. Stiglitz is the one to read, to know how to maintain this inequality. Terminology abounds which panders to the common misunderstanding of such things as fairness, monopolies, natural resources and  wealth, for example. He also has an annoying habit of telling us about what is bad, is going to suggest some remedy, and then skips on to the next thing to criticise.   Natural resources are, by and large, simply the raw material basis from which products are manufactured using capital and intellect in order to create things of value and subsequently wealth through trade. Crude oil and metal ores which are the significant natural resources are of scant direct value to most purchasers. Even crops such as wheat and bananas require much capital and labour inputted into their production and distribution, etc., to be of any significant value to the overall economy of a country.  There is no such thing as a private monopoly. Only a government has the ability to create and maintain a monopoly since government is the sole legitimate power which can use force and the law to prevent others from trading in the market. Microsoft is a favourite to cite, but this is totally wrong since Microsoft can not use force or the law to make computer users use their software or prevent the use of alternatives such as Linux or FreeBSD, for example.  The only fairness that is meaningful in a global economy is the freedom of opportunity which the abolition of trade barriers, government subsidies and regulation, the free movement of people across the globe and the implementation and recognition of private property rights enables. This would also have to include no government printing or minting of money, and central banking would have to be done away with, too, with private banks taking on this role. The private banks would be limited by a return to the gold standard with no fractional reserve banking permitted  Simply citing example after example of how the current norm must be further regulated by tribunals and of-the-moment political expediencies such as environmentalism is of no value whatever.   For a proper understanding about what will work in a globalized economy, I would recommend: 'Capitalism: A Treatise on Economics by George Reisman'         
 If anyone would visit Dallas, Texas and the location where JFK was shot, you realize just how much disinformation has been written on this subject, especially this screen play. I found the entire screen play just a fatasy  of paranoid exploitation by a profiteer claiming to sell the truth! For  example, the grassy knoll is less than 30 feet from the road way, with an  easy 10 second slow jog, up a knoll about 3 feet high from the road way, to  the fence on the Grassy Knoll. If shots came from there it was easy for any  policeman to run to that area, let alone see anyone tryimg to shoot from  such an open area. Even a quick getaway is not as easy as this screen play  makes it out to be, since you can preview the entire parking lot for over  100 yards. Also, the distance from the sixth floor to the road is far  closer by observation that anyone can imagine, except for Oliver Stone.  These easy observable locations makes the Warren Report much more accurate  than this screen play. Also, the people who benefited by JFK's death was  the Democratic Party and its leadership not any right wing Republican  radicals? Johnson won overwhelmingly and the Democrats took even a stronger  positions in the House and Senate. Moreover, to support such a screen play  based upon the past reliability of the author in biographies that are  suppose to be real stories about real people is another reason to doubt its  integrity. Again, another example I can cite here is "On The Fourth Of  July" where Ron Kovic was beaten and thrown out of the 1968 Democratic  Convention, not the Republican Convention. What few know is that Oliver  Stone was a delegate to the Democratic Convention but this fact permits him  to change facts in this film based on poetic license. So be it, but such  behavior cannot be construed for the truth by a truth teller. The same for  this screen play, it is a great work of intentioanl fiction meant to poison  the minds of the reader to reasonable, objective and available facts, and  does it very well indeed, If the public prefers to remain blind, so be it!  Some will say these are stupid stories for stupid people, others will say  it is a great tale but please remember it is just entertainment. Well, this  screen play is a very entertaining story but please don't call it a book of  facts, truth and accuracy. It is a very good fable as well as the film 
 Like many other reviewers, I had to purchase this book for one of my CS courses. As a reference book, it gets no more than 1 star. I find it often confusing in its explanations, incomplete code examples and uneven pace. I understand that it was designed to be a textbook, but it miserably fails to be of any value to a student. For 100+ bucks, I expected a lot more 
 I am an adult who enjoys YA literature, but this book was absolute nonsensical fluff.  I became aware of this book when Amazon recommended it to me because I liked The Boyfriend List.  I read the book in an hour or so last night, and I got nothing worthwhile from the experience.  What stood out to me the most is the fact that the main character's motivation never really made sense.  The plot construction hinges on Claudia concluding that her sex appeal must be waning and deciding to practice her flirting skills by striking up a conversation with one new guy every day.  So far, so good.  The problem is that she comes to this conclusion after only one week of being single, and immediately after some random guy at a party tries to kiss her.  Claudia successfully extricates herself from the guy trying to make out with her, is complimented on the way she handled the guy by her Crush, and what she takes from those back-to-back experiences is that she must not be very attractive to guys.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  Seriously, that's precisely the lack of internal logic and appropriate plot development you can look forward to in this book. Claudia is swarmed with male attention to an unrealistic degree (her ex-boyfriend is trying to get back together with her, band members that she interviews proposition her, the most socially important guy at her first Greek party hits on her, guys at the gym ogle her, a really great guy sees her at a coffee shop once and is so taken with her that he arranges a way to meet cute with her later) and yet she keeps telling us in her narrative that she lacks confidence in her ability to attract men.  I was never able to really connect with Claudia and I did not think that her experiences had any ring of truth to them.  It's a fast read, but completely forgettable and only slightly enjoyable 
 I have no idea whether Morehouse's story is true, or completely made up, but I will say it reads like the latter. I don't believe in conpiracy theories in general not because I don't believe a government would do something bad, but that they could successfully cover it up. It's against all human nature not to talk, especially about something big, so I don't believe secrets are easy to keep nowadays. That said, Morehouse's book reads like badly-written, paranoid "sci-fi"...not a well-written book, neither believable nor entertaining 
 I was sadly disappointed to find I did not like this book at all after all the glowing reviews it received here.  The characters were flat and the author gave me no reason to care about any of them.  Everything was very 2 dimensional for me.  I bought the book as a gift based on the reviews here, then a copy for myself so I could get in on the fun.  I forced myself through half the book before I just tossed it and promised my father a replacement - something I'd read already and knew he would enjoy.  But that's just my opinion - obviously not shared by many 
 This is a very famous and a very influential book. This was not the first time I checked the book out of the library but I now know much more about antidepressants and the related issues than I did when I first became familiar with Kramer's book. What I found on my quick survey of the book this time amazed me. This is not a book supported by research. It is a book of stories. The stories, one after the other, are about Kramer's patients (Kramer is a psychiatrist) and how taking Prozac dramatically transformed lives overnight. Consider these four examples. 1. Sam: "Sam not only recovered from his depression, he declared himself better than well. He felt unencumbered, more vitally alive, less pessimistic. Now he could complete projects in one draft, whereas before he sketched and sketched again. His memory was more reliable, his concentration keener. His memory was more reliable, his concentration keener. Every aspect of his work went more smoothly. He appeared more poised, more thoughtful, less distracted. He was able to speak at professional gatherings without notes.(Page x.) 2. Sally: After four months on Prozac, she looked brighter, calmer, self-assured, in control of herself. The most important effect of the medication, Sally felt was that it cleared her head...After ten months...she negotiated a small promotion and pay raise at a time when the bank was cutting back staff...More remarkable was the change to her private life. She started going to dances...(Page 147.) 3. William M: The patient's low self-esteem, which had been present since his earliest childhood, began to disappear...On medication William M. experienced a sense of self-worth superior to any he had felt before. (Page 203.) 4. Ms. B: For the first time in her memory she felt perfectly relaxed and happy sitting at home reading books or listening to music and felt less of the free-floating anxiety that was previously quelled by going out...Off Prozac, Ms. B. bar-hopped in search of men. Prozac moderated her sense of aloneness and allowed her to enjoy a variety of social settings. Dozens of other examples could be cited. The point is, this is essentially the book. It is a book which convinces the reader of the almost magic power of Prozac by sharing stories like these. What is disturbing is that I now know the truth. Research investigations have found that the power of antidepressants has increased dramatically. They are now more effective because our belief in the power of a pill to cure social shyness, anxiety, depression, and a bad temper has increased dramatically. We have come to believe, as Kramer puts it, "biology is destiny" (page xiv). No where does Kramer explain that the longest of the clinical trial used to get approval of Prozac to market was only 8 weeks long. No where does he share that a tranquilizer was given to study subjects and the other tricks used to make the effectiveness of the drug appear greater than it really is. The dangers of long-term use (diabetes, Parkinson's disease, permanent muscle jerking, etc.) are never discussed. (Of course, these problems were still unknown when Kramer wrote.) See Timothy Scott's wonderful, and unlike Kramer's book, carefully documented book America Fooled: The Truth About Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, and How We've Been Fooled to find the dangers as well as what does bring good mental health. Yes, this book has been influential. Thus, Kramer bears some of the responsibilty for the myth surrounding antidepressants. (They do not work as well as exercise even--numerous studies.) It's funny how, as our knowledge grows, a great book beomes a harmful book, but it is just that.    
 We purchased this for our 2 yr old son for Christmas.  If you create a perfect track (amost never happens) and don't have too many turns, Thomas will follow it most of the time.  This was a complete waste of money.  It really dosn't work as expected.  If I had a chance to try this product out I would never have bought it. 
 While the  idea of having two of the most knowledgeable scholars of the noir film host a coffee-table art book on the topic sounds promising, the resulting product is heinously flawed.  Despite the brevity of the text, a blocky font makes it difficult to read. The 'duotone' reproduction is achieved by imposing blue plate on the black plate--making vintage photographs resemble a poorly adjusted television screen. Further, the large reproductions merely expose the grain, scratches, and dust spots that any skilled retoucher could have removed. Pick up Mark Viera's SIN IN SOFT FOCUS: PRE-CODE HOLLYWOOD and see how this book should have looked 
 Okay, so In Touch has never claimed to be anything other than what it is: A glossy tabloid.  But just when you didn't think it was possible for the American tabloid press to dumb down any further, along came In Touch Weekly and US Weekly.    All In Touch really is is a bunch of photographs.  Their writing is slop, fit for second graders, and it doesn't go into much detail (and we all know how amazingly "accurate" these tabloids are, anyway).  Want a quality tabloid?  Read Hello! magazine (from England). - Donna Di Giacom 
 It is NOT highlighted that this is a CHILDRENS book. We purchased with expectation of a substantial historical work and have now lost $13 for nothing 
 From the live disc, Astronomy Domine is the strongest selection but is marred by a poor original recording and thoughtless transfer to disc.  The bass track is almost nonexistent robbing this song of its thunder. The other three tracks are good, not great, performances of what are perhaps their first important post-Syd Barret compositions.  They are definitely not the band they used to be. The studio disc is a mess.  The first part of David Gilmour's suite is the best bit, some nice blues guitar.  Like disc one, disc two sounds muddy. My overall impression is that the band was in the process of just starting to grow out of their psychedelic jam band britches but hadn't yet figured out what to put on next. Live disc=3 stars; Studio disc=1 star; Net rating=2 stars 
 I have great respect for Charles Jencks as an architect, and as a critic of art relating to such. Therefore the book should be retitled, What is Postmodern Architecture? Or what is everything about Post-Modernism except  the art? The main focus seems to be on the industrial world which created  the art, rather then the art. Seems hardly revolutionary or even relevant  since everyone and their brother and sister has written on that subject  since 1820. I was hoping for something which would address the art, but I  was sorely disappointed. The constant focus on the world around the  buildings of postmodernism dragged and was inebriatingly dull (It got to  the point where the author was forced to contradict himself to make the  book interesting). The focus of Postmoderism was once architecture,  however, now the focus has shifted, it seems everyone except the academics  know this. Not only was his sections on art and literature stupid, but  incorrect, and blunderingly light. I expected more from Jencks, being the  great mind of the century he was. If you want to know anything helpful and  relevant pretaining to Post Modernism today, do not read this book. But hey  if you want to know about your father's post modernism, read this book 
 If you think run-on sentences and page-long paragraphs are a necessary conduit to recondite wisdom, then you might want to wade into this morass of Latinated English prose.  For myself, I think if the professor can't speak ordinary English I suspect that he's not thinking clearly.  I wish I would have been warned that this is a project of two of his adoring pupils.  And I wish I had been warned that couched in the ponderings are rationales, it seem to me, for disgust for the world as we know it, and reasons that Christianity almost has to be pivoted against Jewish religion.  I myself have thought that many good persons have been working on this issue to a much more agreeable resolution 
 Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  But, this IS a good concept... unfortunately, Amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality!  So, until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds... DO NOT try and download Season 1, Episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7!!!  1, 3, 8, 9, and 10 were the only ones that were 100% complete for me 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 The book is set up well with questions to help guide your reading at the beggining of each chapter.  I agree with other posts, that the author doesn;t deal well with the origin of evil. What most concerned me was his compromise of creationism.  He assumes that teh geologic data is correct and therefore wants to make the infallible scripture conform to infallible science, which has changed numerous times over the past several years.  I would not recommend this book at all and would recommend Lectures in Systematic Theology by Theissen instead.  It is an older book but much more reliable.  
 I give this movie 1 star because it lies to the viewer. This movie is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula, but a rip-off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story. If it was named something else or even kept the name Dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name I'd give it 5 stars.  If you want to see the real Dracula story first read the actual book by Bram Stoker, then watch the silent film Nosferatu. Nosferatu is the only Dracula movie that gets the story right. Dracula is a monster, he's not a star crossed lover at all and wasn't intended to be. People wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply isn't one. It's a horror tale, not a vieled porn book, and certainly not a love story. If anything the ones that fail to understand Dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him 
 I was very disappointed with this book. I found it to be very repetitive, filled with things I already knew and so slow moving I couldn't even get through it. Might be perfect for someone who is truly having a "nervous breakdown," but not for the person who is generally well adjusted but wanting to be a bit happier 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 Weber based most of his later works on his first theory of rise of capitalism in Protestant societies. Thus, writing about Indian and Chinese societies he was looking for the reasons for the absence of capitalism in those societies. He concluded that Asian religions are so irrational and other-worldly that they are simply incapable of producing industrial capitalism which is based on rational, secular and this-worldly social ethics.   This conclusion itself has problems vis-?-vis Weber's "objectivity of the social scientist." Successful capitalism in "traditional" Shinto and Buddhist Japan and many other ASEAN countries seem to have already disproved Weber's conclusions that capitalism can arise only in Protestant societies.   My point is not to highlight the capitalist successes of Asia, but just that the purely objective research has its own problems. If we apply Weber's advocacy of "objectivity" in his own writings, we clearly see that his own subjective Western background has influenced his observations and conclusions.   In his zeal to prove Asian religions as other-worldly and mystic, he ignores the great materialistic pursuits of Asia in ancient and medieval times.   On the one hand, Weber argues that intellectual life should relate to some human interest, but on the other hand it should be "objective" rather than mere ideology.  So the objectivity is always relative to some particular interest or project that scholars might have. Weber prescribes his grand vision to researchers but does not seem to practice himself accurately. He is unable to be truly objective because of the subtle political presuppositions he makes about Asian religions 
 Before taking a 4 hour train trip, I surveyed the pulp novels available at the news-stand.  I didn't want to make the mistake of picking up another book I would have to throw away in disgust 3 days later, like "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" or anything by that man-hating forensic anthropologist, what's-her-name.  So I went with "Bourne Ultimatum" as a safe bet, figuring, since I had seen "Identity" and "Supremacy" in the movie incarnations, and they were pretty good, this would be more of the same.    I was very wrong.  From the first few chapters, it became clear that the book was incoherent, repetitive, and its characters were laughably underdeveloped.  Later, huge holes in the plot began to appear, apparent lapses in reason and knowledge on the part of the author regarding their own material.  These seem to haunt many pulp novels, but nowhere is it more annoying.  Also, the author has the lazy habit of putting a lot of dialogue in italics to show emotion, rather than writing emotional dialogue.    This book has become almost unreadable, so it's going to the curb tomorrow.  I'm quitting on page 263.  I don't like or feel attached to any of the characters, and the plot has become a confusing spiral of contrivances.  I agree with the other reviewers who have stated that this book is a real slog to read; the opposite of a page-turner.  It's sad to see a trilogy that apparently started well, end like this.  You can guess from reading it that Ludlum, if he even wrote it, had no interest in the material, but had a contract to fulfill.              
 It would be well enough for the enquiring consumer to use Amazon's "Search Inside" feature and compare this translation by Mirabai Starr with the other Interior Castle translation by E. Allison Peers. Based on the prose alone, the Peers translation is far superior (and includes translation footnotes to explain where a word is difficult to translate). But the Starr translation fails much more miserably on account that an obvious liberal/"progressive" agenda is involved, wherein words like "sin" and "evil" are changed to be more suitable to contemporary sensibilities. Even "Our Lord" is changed into "Beloved." In other words, the translation wants to change this great Catholic mystical work into something more along the lines of New Age or Neopaganism. This is completely unacceptable and a misrepresentation of St. Teresa. Another reviewer who accidently posted his comments on the Peers translation page had this to say about Starr's translation (I disagree, however, that her translation is "lovely"...it's dumbed-down prose, in my opinion):  Mirabai Starr, the translator of this work, describes herself as a "Hindu/Buddhist/Jew translating the Catholic saints". Her translation is lovely, but quite different from the original, as she substitutes St. Theresa's own words with some that are perhaps more "universal". Below are Ms. Starr's own words: "I opted to minimize references to the inherent wickedness of human beings and replace such terms as "sin" and "evil" with "missing the mark," "imperfection," "unconsciousness," "limitations," and "negativity." "Mortal sin" is "grave error." I call "hell" "the underworld" and the "devil" the "spirit of evil". When I name the "three divine Persons" in the seventh dwelling is what Teresa refers to as the "Holy Trinity."   As I said, the translation is quite lovely, but when St. Teresa said "sin" she did not mean "limitation" or "negativity". She meant sin. This translation is useless to me 
 I found myself after reading the book. Sincerely hoping the movie will have a different spin. This is an unsatisfying sequel to the novel Get Shorty. I love Elmore Lenord novels but this is a dud 
 I found this book embarrassing to read - not because it's risque, but because it so clearly illustrates how the French & Italians got their reputations as great lovers. Is this the best that English literature can give us? This fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy, let alone female sexuality.   It's also mean-spirited. Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman, and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept. This is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal. He drips way too much contempt.  Everything outside of sex is dumb, meaningless, ridiculous. Attempting to derive enjoyment from the "mental life" makes one ridiculous; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence's own true and correct way makes one pathetic, or defective, or spiteful; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of "woman" or "man"; and so on.   Looking at Italian art is stupid. Everything in Paris is stupid. Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly.  Reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what's "wrong" with everyone except C. and M., one might easily conclude that Constance doesn't really seem happier now that she's sleeping with the gamekeeper, and Hilda does seem happier in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing "that kind" of happiness as delusional and druglike. He even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there's something wrong with her. Of course Constance is wretched, because she does not have that one thing that, in Lawrence's view, really matters in life - not Mellors, but Mellors' equipment. This book does degenerate into phallus-worship, which makes the author's hostility toward "druglike" pleasures seem sort of ironically comical.  Hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures: from Venice, from the feel of the sun, from jazz, from dancing. This seems weird to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman. Hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a "user", with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man, only to walk away when the dance is over. (This may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist, since obviously Lawrence doesn't mind if Mellors is callous and behaves as a "user".)   It's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one's body. Everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex, but his notion of real sex.   This is where astute readers will have the most trouble. Lawrence clearly defines a "real" woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples.   A woman who lays there "unfeeling" is clearly an example. Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc. Lawrence doesn't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or isn't doing could even be related; it's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically, but in character.  On the other hand, a woman with an unfeminine urge to be In Control - that is, one who insists on moving herself, rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when Michaelis is the male (because he's premature, and meant to be pathetic), but it turns unforgiveable when it's women in general and especially Mellor's Bertha, who just refused to come when she should out of spite. Bertha just had a sick (!) urge to be In Control, demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature. The only thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he "spoilt" her.   As for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy? Forget it. Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch, but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental, nothing important. A Real Woman doesn't need foreplay. Just hop on and go, and if she's what she ought to be, she'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later.  These were what I found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman's duty is to lie there, not too passive, but not too active, and come when she's supposed to (and if she doesn't, it's her own fault); while a man's job is to climb on top and "perform". All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are, unfortunately, not true. The truth is that a woman's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis; there's a thing that both males and females start out with, which in a man becomes the penis, and in the woman becomes (or remains) a clitoris. Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part.   Women have always known about their own bodies; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things, preferably apart from what women think men "want to hear". This, too, is no doubt why it has been accused of being "sexist". The author (or at least Mellors) openly blames women who cannot or will not "come to the crisis" when she ought, as if it were entirely of the woman's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man.   It's also likely that science will eventually prove (if it hasn't already) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be' emotionally as well as physically. For all that Lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly, even noxious emotions and desires - such as "intimacy" and "connection", both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act, but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences, based on the notion that a man's biological job is to get his DNA out there, while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment. If this is true, it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant, not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child.   So - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does, at the same time it's not so clearly obvious that a woman "should" feel that way, as to justify Lawrence's open belittling of women whose emotional states don't match masculine emotional detachment and distance.  There's a lot of talk of "tenderness" - in fact, Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow "lacking tenderness" - but quite frankly I am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender. The only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her, but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find.   I can imagine a woman putting up with - but I cannot imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk, who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal (remembering she's a Lady) when she asks him questions, who calls her c--t as if that were her name, and generally treats her as if she were a whore. I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of, but this is how their relationship really is; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he won't say and the questions he won't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible.  For what it's worth, I think life will be better when this book has become obsolete. It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages, if not their selves. Those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion. As for those who just want a good read - I'd call it a matter of personal taste. Obviously some people enjoy this book. (Equally obviously, I did not. 
 Okay, now, for all of you who are expecting a book that teaches interesting morals and cool things in it, put this book away right now!!! Put it into a dusty corner and whenever you may catch a glimpse of it, laugh in a malicious tone because you haven't feasted your eyes on the most stupid book ever written!! This book ends with such a melancholy abruption that I thought I might be witnessing the severe chopping of a movie gone over far too many minutes. This book...is horrendous. -ANGRY READER 
 Very disappointing!  I ordered STRETCH jeans.  I paid postage to get them here only to find out they are not STRETCH jeans.  I called cust. service.  He spent enough time with me and another department to find out that these jeans must be mismarked and if he (Bealls cust.serv.) sent me another pair I would get the same thing.  In order to get money back I had to return the item.  Now I've paid postage again! and Yes I did receive the $12.99 credit for the jeans, but what about the postage?  This was not my fault!  The item was INCORRECT!!  Your Return Policy indicates that yo uWILL pay the postage, so if you need to see a copy (which I also put in the return box) of what I ordered, please feel free to contact me.

Please return the shipping costs that I paid for a product that apparently mismarked.  thanks, Debbie Pearson P.S.  I see the title description has been corrected to show that these ARE NOT stretch jeans -- wish I would have known so that I would not have to be writing this review.  If no satisfaction is given there will be no more purchases via amazon, but especially not Bealls 
 Greg Frazier has been around the world 4 times on a motorcycle, clearly he has a wealth of knowledge and experience, but mostly only disappointingly vague generalities are included in the book.   The chapter on shipping motorcycles starts "There is no one simple way to ship your motorcycle across the US or around the globe."  This is something I already knew before I bought the book!  Describing the details of shipping his bike from Vladivostok to Los Angeles, Greg writes "Three weeks went by; then, the Russian air cargo company demanded an additional 25% be wired to a numbered account."   Readers seriously contemplating a RTW trip will want to know:  How much was the originally quoted cost?  What was the name of the company?  Did they offer any explanation for the cause of the delay?  Instead of helping readers avoid a similar bad situation, this story included in "Riding the World" may only be repeated time and again by RTW riders because readers are not given enough information to avoid the shipping company Greg used.      Many readers will be interested in the amount of money a RTW motorcycle trip may cost.  From the book: "One American couple spend between $250k and $300k on their ride around the world.  At the other end of the scale, there are riders who claim to have spent only about $10 per day."   What would be tremendously illuminating here would have been the inclusion of Dr. Frazier's own data from his rides:  year(s) of ride, days riding, days not riding, amount of cash spent of gas, oil, maintanence, border/customs fees, mechanical difficulties encountered, and shipping the motorcycle as well other expenses.  Indeed, a modestly detailed 5-10 page write up of each of his RTW trips with included map and financials could have easily made this a 5 star book.  The world being a continuously changing place, I doubt anyone would expect or want to identically duplicate anyone's prior trip, but specific knowledge of what someone did experience before may give the first timer a basis of what to expect on a RTW trip.     Putting down the book, I really can't say that I have any greater knowledge of how to plan and what to expect on a RTW motorcycle trip than before I bought the book.  However, the details on preparing a Kawasaki KLR 650 and BMW GS motorcycle are reasonably well done (and the only thing in the book that buoyed my rating to 2 stars instead of 1).  
 I never received this book. I'm hoping it was overlooked and will be sent soon 
 On a scale of 1 to 10, I give On Rue Tatin a 4. I think my main objection is that I purchased it thinking it was a book about France and food as experienced by the author and her family. Unfortunately, it's much more a book about the author who just happens to be living in France.  In the end, I'm not sure if On Rue Tatin should be classified as a travel book or a memoir because it does not shine in either category. It fails as a travel book because the author is too self-absorbed to give you any feel for the region of France she called home, and it fails as a memoir because the author's life, at least as related in the book, is far from interesting. 
 As a long time fan of the 80's Metallica, this was a horrible disappointment to me after waiting so long for some new material from the guys.  Not only has all the thrash been stripped away, but the rock has shades of alternative music throughout.    Although "Ain't My Bitch" starts out more or less on the right track, the album soon becomes boring, because while the soloing, time changes, and little interludes have mostly disappeared from the songs, they are still mighty long.  Metallica originally wrote long songs so as to properly let them breathe, but these alterna-metal snore-fests would be better if they were short.    For what it's worth, the public seemed to love this and there was suddenly a new generation of Metallica fans, yet again.  It seems that Metallica knew exactly what they were doing by taking time off and then coming out with a different sound that kept them in the mainstream.  That doesn't make me enjoy "Load" any more, though 
 This isn't really a 260 page book, it's a 5 page pamphlet that repeats itself over and over.    Really there is nothing new here if you've read Rich Dad Poor Dad, beyond a shameless marketing co-promote for his games, other books and a few of his friends.  Overall I thought Rich Dad Poor Dad was a pretty good book.  This book however made me realize that Mr. Kiyosaki really has discovered the secret to becoming rich - write one half way decent book and then milk it as long as you can with other related books and products 
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 Like another reviewer stated, it sounds corny and fake. I must agree.  Some of it is ok, but it sounds like commercialized North American Indian music, which I suppose it is 
 I recently purchased this disc and I must say, I am ashamed to even have it in my collection.  I am either going to sell it to a  second-hand store, or throw it in the river.   What is all the fuss about this guy?  I don't get it.   O.K.  He is a great guitar player - I'll give him that.  But, his singing and songwriting are lousy.   ...   I also recently purchased the Blasters "American Music"  which is excellent.  Folks,  don't waste your time or money on this one. .. 
 JUST LIKE IN MY OTHER REVIEW I CAN'T FIGURE OUT  THE MADNESS OVER THESE GUYS. I WILL ASK IN THIS POST AS WELL FOR SOMEBODY TO ACTUALLY EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THEY SHOULD BE HEARD AND ARE RELEVANT IN A CREATIVE WAY. HONESTLY PEOPLE YOU CAN'T CALL THESE GUYS ARTISTS. AN ARTIST CREATES SOMETHING FROM A IDEA OR TWO THESE GUYS TAKE THOSE IDEAS AND JUST LUMP THEM TOGETHER. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT. AND TO TOP IT OF THEY DON'T HAVE THE CHOPS AS MUSICIANS TO BE RELEVANT IN THAT FORM EITHER. A COMMENT LIKE "THEY ROCK" OR "THE LEAD SINGER IS SOOOO HOT" AREN'T EXAMPLES OF A GREAT ARTIST OR BAND. FROM THE DATES OF THE LAST POST MY WORDS MIGHT BE IN VAIN, KIND OF LIKE THE VALIDITY OF THIS RECORD. BECAUSE THERE HASN'T BEEN A POST ON HERE FOR TWO YEARS. IF A FAN OF BANKING BENJAMINS DOES STUMBLE UPON THIS POST I INVITE YOU TO CHECK OUT MY OTHER REVIEWS, AND CHECKOUT SOME RELEVANT AND GREAT MUSIC 
 Although this text does cover a wide range of safety topics, it is somewhat dated and contains a farly large number of typos.  Therefore, the reader has to be careful.  The book needs to be updated and the typographical errors corrected.  If that were to be done, it would definitely be a five star book 
 I don't believe I've ever read such an unhelpful organizing book.  Much of the book is spent on describing the assumed state of the problem, rather than on offering solutions to the problem.  (Do I really need half a chapter to tell me that my kitchen is disorganized?  If I didn't already know that, why was I reading the kitchen chapter?)  The remainder of the "stuff" organization chapters (as opposed to the time management chapters in the first section of the book) consists of lists of tips.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of these tips are things that most of us could have figured out on our own.  "Write down what you're running out of BEFORE you run out of it." We don't necessarily all DO this, but I don't think we needed help coming up with the concept.  Moreover, most of the methods the author recommends will only work well for a small segment of the population - that is, those who don't actually struggle with disorganization but who have simply not gotten around to getting organized before.  For example, the method given for organizing a room is to dump EVERYTHING into the middle of the room, from all of the drawers, shelves, etc., and start from there.  For some people, this may work great.  For many of us, it would result in being immediately overwhelmed, crashing and burning when barely into the project, ending up with a much larger mess than what we started with, and, possibly, giving up on any further attempts to get organized.  Besides the lack of helpful instruction offered, I did not care for the author's tone/attitude.  The entire thing - especially the first section - made me feel as though I was constantly being beaten over the head.  The author continually railed against the "excuses" I was supposedly making for not getting organized and why I needed to just suck it up and do it.  Well, contrary to the author's perception, I had every intent of "sucking it up" and doing the job - that's why I bought the book and was reading it.  She also operates on the assumption that everyone has loads of disposable cash lying around and that everyone's lifestyle is - or should be - like hers.  ("When have you ever used more than one paper bag in a month?"  How about when we had the newspaper delivered every day and we used paper bags for holding the newspapers and taking them to the recycling point?  Does the author truly believe that NOBODY, ANYWHERE has a use for more than one paper bag per month?)  She recommends paying someone else to do nearly every imaginable task, and her not-so-creative solutions to most organizing problems are to just "buy such-and-such a gizmo."  If I HAD plenty of money to buy every organizing gizmo on the market, I WOULD NOT BE DISORGANIZED in the first place.    Finally, she routinely discourages respect for the other people in our lives.  If someone is late for dinner, she says don't heat up his dinner, because his own poor time management is not your problem.  So if my hard-working husband is late for dinner because a job took longer than anticipated I should leave him to fend for himself because it's technically "not my problem"?  I would skip this book, in favor of others whose authors are a little more knowledgeable AND gracious. 
 This is the worst software I bought.   First,it cost $100 and McAfee did not honor the $55 rebate because I sent the rebate form a little late. They had only 15 days to send out after purchase while compusa receipt has much longer deadline to send our rebate form. Isn't that kind of trick?   Second and most important, it slowed down everything, not a bit but by dozens of seconds  or even more than 1 minute.   Third,the speed is not only the problem, its wireless connection sucks to the maximum and a couple of my machines can't get online and can't connect to the network. I have 3 PCs and 1 laptop. Only two machine can get connected. It also conflicts with Belkin network card driver which has been so popular for so many years. How the hell McAfee did not know that adaptor?  Fourth, there is no manual whattsover and you have to all figure that out yourself. Given it has so much problem it's very frustrating to configure it. Sometimes the security center is downloading forever. Who the hell knows what it is doing. Sucks.   I had spent so much time to fine tune it and it still sucks that much. I changed back to Internet Security Suite which is much better than this. Don't buy it even they give it to you free or you will break the disk.   
 This is the most ridiculous book I have ever read.  It is laughably hokey and unrealistic.  There is even a scene where Jason gives a karate chop to the back of someone's neck and they fall unconscious....I mean really, I thought that only happened in Get Smart episodes or perhaps Charlie's Angels.  I understand this is fiction but there needs to be some basis for reality...otherwise why not just have the characters fly around like Superman 
 This really is a mixed lot with some catchy tunes and some haunting melodies and also some fillers. Like 'In Blue' before it, this does not reach the standards of 'Talk On Corners' or 'VH1 Live in Dublin'. Standout tracks are 'Summer Sunshine', 'Long Night' and the Gavin Friday/Bono collaboration 'Time Enough For Tears'.Other than that, the rest are B-Sides at best...Disappointin 
 Since we bought this to work with our Mac, we have had nothing but problems.  If asked to print one page of a document only, it freaks out, all the lights flash and has to be turned off an on again to reset it and calm it down!  Have had long sessions with HP customer service on the phone and they haven't a clue.  If we could have been bothered, we would have taken it back, but just live with the fact that we have to print excess pages (at least we do recycle).  There are various other things that also cause it to freak and flash, can never work out specifically what, we just sigh and reset it.   Will be looking for something else to upgrade to soon 
 Not only are the other comments on the printing quality correct, but the EXACT SAME BOOK EXISTS in a 2006 EDITION!!  The "Science of Sex" is the original(?) 1996 edition.  The 2006 edition of the VERY SAME BOOK is titled, "Sperm Wars: Infidelity, Sexual Conflict, and Other Bedroom Battles".  Explain to me why the author would reprint his original book under a new title?  Anyway, I'm returning this one, since I bought both books at the same time, thinking they had entirely different content. Furthermore the new edition is of much better printed quality, with none of the problems mentioned about this edition.  One more thing of note...the new edition is HALF THE PRICE of this crappy version!!!  Can't wait to actually read it 
 This is actually a translation from the 1820s so the translation is very archaic & the spelling of the Arabic names is very nonstandard compared to modern transliteration equivalents. Likewise the notes are very dated and not very helpful. There seem to be missing parts and the ordering does not reflect the true itinerary.  Not to mention the fact that for all but experts in the Muslim world, much of this book would be very difficult to understand and much would be missed.  To really get a good idea of Ibn's travels, read the 'Adventures of Ibn...' by Ross. It may not have every word of the work, but it more than makes up for it by providing tons of cultural and historical background and by being very readable. There's a new paperback version out. See my review on that page.  If you must read the real book as well, don't try this one. Unfortunately, most other versions aren't complete and only cover parts of the travels. Even if you try a version of the full text, I recommend reading Ross 1st to help make the text more comprehensible & meaningful 
 I purchased this and spent 3 days on the phone with Hewlett Packard trying to get the correct adapter so it would fit my R818 camera (the dock has a thin port, roughly 10 connectors) while the R818 has a mini USB plug).  HP was less than helpful when it came to trying to get the correct adapter, getting a different answer each time I spoke to a different rep (even being told at one point that no supervisors were working).  I was finally able to get someone willing to send me one, but said it was going to be 10+ business days to get it, which by then I'll be on vacation (and I purchased it well in advance giving myself time to get the adapter, thinking it was not hard to get).  I was looking forwared to using the dock on my vacation.  I would definately *not* recommend this if you have the Photosmart R818 digital camera, unless you like the stress of spending hours on the phone with Hewlett Packard trying to get a correct part, and waiting 10+ business days to get it 
 I have read all of Bryson's books and loved them. Intuition said to NOT but this book since reliving childhood has been done time and time again. In my opinion, the TITLE of this book is the only creative part of the book - sure, Bryson can be funny but this book reeks of being forced. Really not worthly of what the author has done in the past. We have heard all of this before. Save your money or go to the library 
 Having spent some time reading such books at the Tipping Point and others, I started grabbing books with scientific claims (and have at least a passing interest in Splenda as I occasionally use products containing it) because I feel much of the science in these books tends to be snippets taking out of context.  The only thing I can say is that after reading this book and looking for other materials on the safety of Splenda, is that the author obviously has done no actual research, rather she attempts to take other studies completely out of context to fit her agenda (which seems to be cashing in on the popularity of splenda - Ironic, don't you think?)   I think at the least Amazon should reference this book in an urban myths section, or perhaps file under "bunk science."  All in all, I feel better about the cranberry juice made with splenda I drank while reading this book.  
 Really wonderful book for those who love art written by a brilliant man with a broad scope of knowledge. Accessible to anyone, yet also intellectually satysfying. Highly recommende 
 I made a mistake in buying this item thinking since I had one when I was little it would be similiar.It is not,the edges are stiff and strings are pulling out.The fuzz all over the blanket gets all over your sheets.It is a raggedy sorry substitute for my cozy soft one I remember 
 No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.  The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?  To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
 I recently re-read this book because the moment I read "The End", I forgot everything that happened in the book.  My initial purchase of To Marry the Duke was based upon the lush, sensual cover and the fact that it was based on one of my favorite historical eras; the Gilded Age of America.   Based upon my re-reading of this romance, I was disappointed. MacLean has a clean, coherent prose and dialogue that had it's shiny moments, but the shoddy plotting and the one-dimensional characters overtook it most of the time.  I would have believed Sophia's instant infatuation with James if his (false) courtship had been a contrast to the cool treatment she recieved from the English society. Consequently, once James has married, bedded and ignored her, she accepts his trickery of her as though she deserved it. Sophia is supposed to be a spunky, warm American to blow some heat into James' heart, but she came across as a doormat who would do anything for a man who had betrayed her trust.  James' tortured past was very vaguely alluded to, leading me to be very skeptical of his behavior as well as his falling for Sophia at the end of the book. His one-dimensional character, combined with the fact that most of the book was in Sophia's point of view kept me at an emotional distance from him.  James' family was cardboard as well and the "mystery" surrounding them with the French courtesan was sloppily done and read as though it was put into the story to make Sophia look like a hero and open James' eyes to how wonderful she was.  All in all, this was a passable read. Sophia's doormat perfectness and James' vague aloofness, combined with hither and there plotting made what started off a somewhat sparkling and stand-out historical romance into a read I forgot as soon as the pages were closed 
 The book was about a girl named Jennifer and a toad that she bought from a magic shop for a school  project about pets.   The only thing she did not know about the toad was that the toad,bufo, could talk.   I would recomend this book to people who like Fairy tales , or books with  magic. The characters in this story are Jennifer ,Ellen, Mr Elives, Sharra, Skippy, Brandon,Mrs.Murdley, and Bufo the toad.   My opinion of this story was that it was not so good but ok. I thought the book was boring 
 I read Flags of Our Fathers and enjoyed it more than Flyboys.  Bradley has a writing style that is difficult at times as has personal biases come through very clearly.  As one other reviewer has written, I found it very odd that he often referred to MG Curtis LeMay as "Curtis."  As someone writing about military history, Bradley should have more respect for the uniform and should not call a two star general by his first name like he is talking about one of his golfing buddies.  This was very distracting.  I also found the first couple of chapters of his history lesson very tedious and unfocused - so much so that I nearly quit reading the book.  The latter chapters pick up the pace and are insightful.  Bradley also devotes too much time attempting to demonize the American firebombing tactics.  Thankfully Bradley's bias and negativity toward the Navy and Army is not as pronounced in Flyboys as in FOOF.  This bias is especially odd considering his father was a Navy Corpsman.  
 When merging female vocal yodels and copying elements from Switchblade Syphony, one can only be disappointed in Diva Destruction's music.  The positive aspect is the better production on this CD compared to their debut 
 T.E. Lawerence was certainly an extraordinary figure in history based on his achievements with the Arabs during WWI but not all heroes are great writers and Lawrence is NOT a good writer.  Do yourself a favor and get a book on Lawrence of Arabia by a professional history writer or although not exactly historically correct (but close enough) watch the fabulous movie "Lawrence of arabia".  You will still get the true feeling of what it was like back then and what Lawrence was trying to accomplish.  His book will just confuse the reader 
 Primarily Barry Singer's compilation (with some re-editing) of pieces he wrote for a number of publications, perhaps most notably The New York Times, Ever After: The Last Years of Musical Theater and Beyond is intriguing as surface-level look at the last couple of decades in musical theater.  It's useful for little else, however--Singer speeds through discussions of important shows, wastes time detailing events and productions of minor importance at best, and never provides a truly engaging or thought-provoking point of view.  Instead, he attempts to pass his opinions off as fact, which results in a number of statements of questionable veracity that have been noted by theater writers and critics from the esteemed Mr. Miller to Peter Filichia.  Perhaps even more unfortunate is that Singer's chronicle covers exactly the same time period as Ethan Mordden's forthcoming The Happiest Corpse I've Ever Seen: The Last 25 Years of Musical Theatre; Singer's Ever After does not stand up well to Mordden's latest volume, coming across more as a simpleton's whining screed opposite an intelligent and informed gentleman's thoughtful analysis.  Ever After is perhaps most enjoyed and appreciated by those with little functional knowledge of the workings of New York theater; they're likely to find Singer's anecdotes more interesting than people who know it's possible cover the subject in considerably more depth than Singer attempts 
 This CD was a big disappointment. It was one song after another that sounded like the last. By the time I was halfway through a song, I found myself fast-forwarding to the next track. It would be OK as background music but otherwise I find it pretty musically boring 
 A great musician but a man desperate for intellectual respect.  The book is virtually 400+ pages of an application for membership into some haughty Paris salon.  Caetano should have stuck to what he knows best-music.  The endless and mind-numbing name-dropping and references to obscure books, artists and philosophers are the written equivalent of a 5 minute arena drum solo.  OK, we know you are smart, that you have ecletic and fine taste, etc. Now tell us about your music. How did you write it, how did you record it?  There is sadly too little information about music and too much dismissal of others for perceived intellectual deficiencies, musical or otherwise.  Speaking of his music, I recently saw Caetano in concert and was shocked by the syrupy shmaltz--he actually performed "Feelings" in English and in total sincerity. He virtually refused to perform anything in Portuguese, perhaps it is not a cerebral enough a language...nothing more than feelings.  UPDATE:  Another reviewer found my review above to be in error, because Caetano is "30 years ahead of his time" in singing one of history's most painfully bad songs, Feelings. The reviewer found the whole thing very funny. I am sure that the reviewer has the famous Teutonic sense of humor to appreciate the joke.  I for one, heard a corny song in accented English.  Forgive me for missing the joke while I tried to cover my ears 
 Maybe I shouldn't be reviewing this book, but I found it so boring I could not get into it.  I found her observations about love to be trivial.  Much of the discussion makes reference to Freud (one of the biggest quacks of the 20th century) and uses an intellectual tone to try to demonstrate unfounded generalities.  Not very informative, not very interesting and not at all scientific 
 I don't even know where to start with this, and I have to admit that despite several attempts, I only made it through 110 pages and couldn't stomach any more. Based on the first 110 pages, one of the main characters, Augusta, is so snide and rude and intolerant of anyone who believes or thinks differently than she does, that she seems more like a 13-year-old brat than an adult woman. The author clearly has issues with religion and makes every religious person in the book a caricature and portrays the people who are basing their lives on the occult as the "wise" ones. And even given that conservative-bashing and Christian-bashing is what all the "popular kids" are doing in our society, I will say that even the author's characterization of Augusta is extreme. This novel just didn't appeal to me at all 
 This book is accurate as a blind folded archer spun 3 times in a game of pinata. There is no real useful info in this book, you'd get more tactics out of a Steven Seagal film. This book should be taken out of print before some dummy hurts themselves. If you're interested in learning the tricks of the trade buy a surplus field manual (FM), Watch Discovery Channel, or Join the Military or some Government agency. Billy Powell was a very misinformed hippie. The part that gave it all away was the part about the M-1 Garand. "Used in both World Wars and Korea" WW2 and Korea yes, WW1 no. I think its luck of some higher power that this dummy didn't hurt himself in the process. 
 Harold Ramis's "The Ice Harvest" wallows in mid-market crime and holiday angst, but never really hits either the comic or noir heights to which it aspires.  All the ingredients are there, but ultimately the movie lacks spice.  In some movies, it works where all the characters move at a slow pace - "Nobody's Fool," for example.  But a dark comedy needs some pep, and "The Ice Harvest" doesn't have it.  A lot of that blame falls on the shoulders of John Cusack, one of my favorite actors.  He is at his best when he is riffing one of his intelligent-yet-soulful monologues, like in "High Fidelity" and "Say Anything."  Here, Cusack's job is to look morose and make the occasional comment - he may speak the fewest lines in any film he's made as a leading man, and that's a shame.  Billy Bob Thornton tries to liven up the movie in his scenes, but the menacing actor is off-screen for huge swaths of time and his absence is felt.  The same with the entertaining Oliver Platt, who plays a drunken buffoon as well as anyone - he's enjoyable on-screen, but when he's not there, we miss him.  The bar is set pretty high for holiday-as-setting-for-dysfunction movies. None of the exchanges rise to the visceral heights of the husband-wife spat of "The Ref," for example.  The movie is filled with small-time hoods who all seem hung-over or depressed rather than moved to exercise their savage wits.  Instead, we get an ominous film that in many ways tries to evoke "Fargo" or "A Simple Plan," but doesn't get anywhere close.    There are a few laugh-out-loud moments that I won't spoil that keep the movie from being a complete waste of time.  But all in all, the movie is a downer, and when the winners are finally revealed at the end, it feels less like a triumph than it does a ho-hum conclusion.    Throughout the movie, I kept wondering if this would have been a much more enjoyable movie where we got to see what was actually going on inside the minds of the characters . . . there seemed to be many scenes where the actors kept the best lines to themselves.  Petty crime can be highly enjoyable, but not in "The Ice Harvest."  
 I knew the ending within the first 10 minutes.  M. Night Shamalamadingdong disappointed me and should go back to his job at Denny's 
 I bought the book at the suggestion of Harv Eker, whom I respect. However, I found this book to be dogmatic and lacking the inspiration that I expected. I found that many of the chapters were dry, brief, and did not connect with me. I had the sensation of having someone who had heard "this is how to be productive with your time" from someone else and was passing on the cliff notes. Instead of this book, I would recommend Brian Tracy's Goals! - which gave me much more inspiration and practical exercises 
  I just recently heard "Buffalo Stance" on my local college radio station, and it brought back memories of the first time I heard it in back in the winter of 1989. It isn't difficult to see why this song was so popular back then; it had all the infectious grooves an excellent pop song should have. But there's a problem with the overall album of Raw Like Sushi: all the songs that surround "Buffalo Stance" don't even come close to matching its catchiness. Even the inexplicably praised "Manchild" is dull.   Find the single for "Buffalo Stance" if you can, and pick up a Salt & Pepper album as an alternative to Raw Like Sushi.   
 Robert Jordan's "Wheel of Time" is a love-'em-or-hate-'em series -- either you will adore it for its thick machinations and intense detail, or hate it for the glacial pace and often-annoying characters.   By the time the sixth novel arrived, it was becoming clear that if Jordan even possessed the ability to finish the series, he wasn't going to anytime soon. The seventh, eighth and ninth books are compiled in this boxed set, but it seems like very little actually happens in these doorstoppers.  "Crown of Swords," which suffers from this glacial pace, includes Elayne, Aviendha, and Mat searching for a magical bowl that will reverse a deadly heat wave, but Mat's flirtatious nature attracts a ravenous Queen who won't take "no" for an answer. Unfortunately, Rand (who spends most of the book thinking) now believes that he's going bonkers.  Things only go further downhill in "Path of Daggers," both for the characters and the readers. Rand believes that his magic will kill everyone he holds dear, and must also deal with the Seanchan as they attack the Dragon Reborn (that's Rand), Ebou Dar and everybody Rand commands. Meanwhile, his friends are still en route to wherever they are going, and the Bowl of Winds has cooled the heat wave.  The same holding pattern is in place in "Winter's Heart," where Rand is still upset and has nearby been killed. His friends are distracted by a series of kidnappings, crownings and civil wars within the Aes Sedai, and so Rand must tip the balance against the Dark One by himself, even if it takes twenty more books to do so.  Long books or series can sometimes be a blessing; the best and most beloved of the fantasy genre are usually big awkward tomes, or at least several books long.  Unfortunately, when a series loses momentum, and the same cast is used in every book... the series is going to inevitably deteriorate. As a result, Jordan's series is overflowing with potentially glorious plotlines, but most of them are stretched thin until you just want the things to end.  One of the biggest problems with Jordan's series is that his women -- almost without exception -- act like the most demented man-haters in the world. This wasn't as annoying when the series showed some forward momentum, but when it's in a holding pattern, this becomes teeth-grindingly unbearable. It makes one wonder about Jordan's own relationships.  So do descriptions of braid-pulling, cleavage, smoothing clothing, and the details of farms, vases and statues that we will never, ever see again. Jordan does not seem to realize that except for the monumentally talented -- Tolkien, McKillip, Lewis -- less is more. His focus on minutiae feels like he is trying to fill out the required number of pages.  Virtually nothing is accomplished in these three novels, except for finding that bloody bowl and fighting a few battles; there are meetings that decide nothing, journeys that don't end, and political conflicts that get progressively messier without reaching a finale. And Rand, who spends relatively few pages being active, has reached the level of a polygamous demi-god, yet he doesn't come across as being a future savior, but an uncertain kid.  The seventh, eighth and ninth volumes of the "Wheel of Time" series seem impressive, until it becomes clear that virtually nothing is going on. In truth, Jordan is spinning his "wheel. 
 LO QUE TE PUEDO DECIR ES PRIMERAMENTE AUN NO ME HA LLEGADO ESTE ARTICULO, PARA PODER APRECIAR A AMBOS ARTISTAS JUNTOS EN CUANTO ME LLEGUE PODRE EMITIR ALGUNA OPINION, POR EL MOMENTO NO PUEDO EN TANTO NO TENGA EN MIS MANOS ESTE ARTICULO 
 ...and was left putting the book down every two seconds because I was annoyed by it. It is not marvelously written; in fact, I found myself correcting his sentence structure and grammar in at least every other paragraph, if not more (editor, please?). It's an interesting enough plot, but the way it's put forth is mindnumbing. The non-fiction information he put in there could have been ten times more interesting in two ways. First, if the information had been summarized in about two pages. And second, if he hadn't pretended like everyone reading this book was in the second grade and had minimal comprehension abilities.   I'm usually a fast reader, but this book (a quick 415-page paperback read) took me more than a month, just because I had to keep putting it down. If you simply want something to "frighten" you, or are unusually interested with autopsies (there are about five million in the book), and don't care about poor writing, pick this book up 
 Flowery. Verbose. Rambling. Compound sentence upon compound sentence. This book was unreadable for me. I quit 
 But being boring is.   Prager is dull 
 Maybe it was more like buyer beware, I was really disapointed in how superficial and extrapolated the content of the subject was. I don't consider this a an essential piece for any serious u2 fan, it  leaves you with way too much ambuguity 
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 I agree with what Elain, another reviewer, writes below. Told through a series of letters, the novel spans Bess' life. I found this tedious and the writing unnatural, written for the readers of the novel and not for the readers of the actual letters. Bess meanders through her life, a goody-two-shoes, writing smarmy virtuous thoughts while manipulating those around her- the only element of the story that was interesting. elain wrote:   Despite rave reviews, I thought Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey's A Woman of Independent Means was a weak story. For one thing, the life of the protagonist Bess was only explored through her correspondence over the years. It is impossible to reveal a whole life through letters only. There are other nuances to a character that cannot possibly be revealed through letters; those are only what Bess chooses to write about. It's true that a life through letters gives the novel character, but also it does not expose as much as an omnicient narrator would. Also, it seems that Hailey adds dimension to her novel by introducing a string of tragedies. It is very uncommon that Bess's husband and son die within her lifetime, her house burns down, her daughter is struck by a car and later befriends a count, etc. Such events were constantly inserted into the story until it became unrealistic and maudlin. It may be true that Bess lives a life scarred by tragic events, but these happenings are so plentiful it is almost fantastical. To sum it all up, if you're interested in exploring the life of a very colorful lady, read this. But if you're looking for a novel that will leave you awed, you'd better head back to the bookshelf 
 It's incredible that this yankee brat likened this drivel of book to Papillon, one of the greatest books ever.  How dares he, this spoilt NY brat who couldn't figure out if to smoke hash or pot or be gay or not. It's one of the worst books ever!  It has nothing to do with Papillon at all! It's a diary of a whiner, a naive primitive, spoilt American, and a criminal brat. Let's face it, he did attempt to smuggle and he was a drug user.  There's no way around it! Papillon is a march towards grace and soul freedom over elements and hurdles of life told in the most adventurous style.  This lowly tale is a strife of a spoilt New Yorker, who never once had to work in his life and had everything handed to him on a platter.  His tribulations are of personal nature only second guessing his sexuality and penchant for drug abuse.  Nothing in the book makes for good reading.  It's of no spiritual or uplifting value 
 I know this book like the back of my hand. Many of my friends will tell you I've regurgitated stuff from this book for years. Three years after picking up this book and looking into most of his conclusions, now I can see I knew the truth all along.  I didn't read something one day and say "maybe Dr. Darkwah is wrong afterall" or anything like that. I had an epiphany. I put my doubts about Dr. Darkwah's credibility into perspective and now I can say he's wrong on many levels.  The basic premise that Africans, particularly Egyptians, are the authors of the documents that became the Bible is true in my book, however, Dr. Darkwah also claims the Akan and other distantly related W. African ethnic groups were the Egyptians, which is proven to be false.   I seriously considered this part of his hypothesis for two reasons. One, West Africans do indeed have close genetic, cultural, religious and linguistic ties with ancient Nile Valley populations. Two, a mass migration out of the Nile Valley as the Muslims took over N. Africa just seemed like a cool story.   Dr. Darkwah uses very reliable sources for his information but him not being a credited historian or anthropologist himself shows throughout the book. I can no longer entertain the notion of the Akan being the most dominant group in dynastic Egypt. This is all because Dr. Darkwah doesn't fully understand history, much less pre-history. Any similarities (there are tons) between modern W. Africans and dynastic Egyptians can easily be explained by the once fertile Sahara.   I was looking into the Sahara before I read Dr. Darkwah's book but him being Aduana royalty and knowing the ins and outs of many W. African groups like the Ewe and Hausa, as well as his mainstream sources and apparent knowledge of Egypt and Egyptology, clouded my judgement, I admit.   It's simple. Dr. Darkwah finds so many linguistic, cultural and religious ties between Akans and ancient Egyptians because they come from the same stock. This is true because things like divine kingship, ancestor veneration, certain forms of color symbolism etc. are Saharan. The ancestors of W. African and Nile Valley populations were once shiny happy people in a once lush Sahara region until the drying up of the region forced migrations east and westward.   It was always that simple but Dr. Darkwah's fantastic theories of Akan oral legend matching with ancient Egyptian history seriously made me reconsider all of my other sources. I began looking for sources that confirm some of Dr. Darkwah's theories and ocassionally came across credible ethnographic data that could be used to confirm his theory, but it really doesn't. Dr. Darkwah is flat out wrong about W. Africans being in the Nile Valley.   As for the bigger picture, I think Dr. Darkwah's work is a good but imperfect start to a pivotal subject. It's good because it's about time Biblical scholars and the lay stop crediting Jews or Hebrews with the earliest concepts of a higher power. There's ample proof the Egyptians and peoples of Mesopotamia were the first to have complex writing systems and the first to write about this "God" at length.  Don't get me wrong, the book isn't totally wrong. I did my own fact finding and even after noticing Dr. Darkwah's flaws I can say his theory of the Bible being the result of years of Hellenistic Jews rummaging in the library of Alexandria and the Hebrew really being of Egyptian stock is confirmable and more plausible than any of the traditional reasonings. 
 I loved this book---before I had kids!!  I do believe it was helpful in some ways, because I agree with her philosophy.  However, in practice, these methods are spotty at best.  Also, it was only after having kids, that I realized how hostile this author is to parents.  Every misbehavior of kids is blamed on the parents' lack of understanding.  Any parent who is reading this book is obviously trying to be as good a parent as they can and to have this author continuously bash parents as being controlling, etc. is extremely demoralizing.  Check this book out of the library, it has some good points--but DONT buy it 
 I found this book disappointing. The author goes to great pains to argue that it is hard to make a living in rural VT. This book seems like something the author and photographer did to pay their bills while living in rural VT, not because they had something to offer.  I found the book quite disjointed. It wasn't chronological, thematic, person-centered or anything else. I ended the book not having learned much about the people, their farming, or much else. The pictures were nice, but I wasn't really looking for a coffee table book; I was looking for a book about people farming on a small organic farm in VT, and did not get it 
 When an outsider Darwinian evolutionist embraces this book as agreeing with his metaphorical spin on God's non-metaphorical Genesis 1-11, the endorsement is telling! Matter of Days mongrelizes the Lord's documentation of what He did and when/how He did it. Whatever a Darwinianist thinks of Day 4 - long or short - Genesis clearly documents that's when sun, moon and stars were MADE, not just appeared as the clouds cleared. However, bigbangers like the author can't accept that version, so have sun, moon,stars evolving over billions of years along the standard evolutionary cosmythological scenario of Carl Sagan and cohorts. Secular astrophysics dictates, defines and determines how God intended to communicate His documentary! God Himself in His Own plaintext recording of events is dismissed or subject to secular revisionism to cater to scientific rationale. How best to handle the Bible? NOT 'God said it, I believe I know what He meant and that settles my slant on it' as Darwinianism or metaphorianism choose to spin it. Rather, 'God documented it in plain Hebrew through Moses the Prophet, that settles it for those taking God at His Word unvarnished and unredefined for modern consumption, I choose to believe the Original Literal Version over the metaphorical perversion.'  That this farce would appeal to Bible-alterers,however sincere, held intellectually captive to modern science philosophism is tantamount to disendorsement for the serious Bible-accepter-at-face-value. 
 When I was a child, my mother read me the "Warm Fuzzy" story.  When I became a parent I wanted to read it to my own children.  I ordered this book, thinking it MUST be the story I remember.  But in the story I knew, nobody got "diseases of the spine" and then DIED.  UGH!  I don't want to read this to my children!  So I did some more searching, and the real story, as I remember it, is the one written by Richard Lessor.  It is no longer in print, but you can find used copies on Alibris.  It is far less creepy than this one 
 honestly, i think this is horrible nothing catchy or good about it..all the songs sound the same just nothing syticks out...there last cd was the same thing but a little better. if your gonna buy one bleeding through cd i recommend portrait of the goddess...stay away from thi 
 I agree with the other post. Great if you have a Nikon flash, but not much  help with other types of lighting solutions. The author needed to get into  more detail other than just flash photography. Also,the writing was hard to  follow and confusing 
 I was trying to think of the best short description of what this is. Sure it's a propaganda film but that doesn't mean much to most people. However, most people have seen attack ads around election time. That's what this is, a very long political attack ad, full of all the things we commonly see in such ads: distortions, sarcasm, scary close ups, mood music, mocking tone, glaring omissions, out of context quotes, etc.  That said, the most rewarding review so far must be the one by AT "DL" (New York), who basically condemns Michael Moore as pro-Bush because Fahrenheit 9/11 doesn't say Bush engineered 9/11 himself. What's next? A review that condemns AT "DL" (New York) as pro-Bush because his review didn't say that Bush flew the planes himself? Or that Bush is an alien who gave birth to Saddam and Osama on a UFO?  Just when you think you've seen the craziest conspiracy theory .. 
 It's over for Luca Turilli. Once he was a prodigy; not just one of the greatest creative forces in the history of heavy metal, but one  of the greatest artists of his generation in any medium. His music was the power, glory and majesty of an Eric Eddison or J. R. R. Tolkien novel brought to life in sound. Words fail me in describing the Rhapsody albums, culminating in Dragonflame, their masterpiece. It was divine, superhuman, traditional and yet modern, graceful and yet brutal.   But the cracks began to appear in the last couple of Turilli projects: his second solo album and the last Rhapsody studio album, both of which were merely good, not transcedently great like the old material. And now this: electronic bleepings, female vocals, dorky environmentalist lyrics and dolphins and pyramids in the cover art. There's only a shadow of the old spirit left. His inspiration is gone, and once it goes, it never comes back. It's the same pattern with every artist. They keep on going becaue it's their profession, but they have nothing left to say.  Here's to Luca Turilli and the genius he was. Don't condemn him for this afterthought of an album after his creative period is evidently over. Everyone has to make a living and if anyone deserves to be able to live off his laurels, it's this man. Instead celebrate and appreciate his great victories of the past, for his like will never come our way again

 I wish Mr. Sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels. That flow and voice I understood so well. At First Sight felt like I was reading a deadline novel. Just words, no insight, didn't make this reader think at all. Sorry, just the way I read it. 
 I was expecting a little more substance from the book, perhaps some deeper examples and some better analysis and dirt and gossip from the wackoes that ran these dot coms, but the book was no more than a listing with a blurb at best on a whole stack of companies that went under.  The blurbs were funny to read at first, but get old and dull pretty fast, and the whole thing ends up being a fun read for no more than 10 pages.  It's a shame, I would think there's a lot of good dirt to dredge up and write about, and I was hoping this would touch on that, but it doesn't.  I would skip this one 
 Benford is one of those writers who wax hot and cold.  He is acclaimed to be a science fiction writer's "scientist" in that he deals with a lot of "hard" science.  In this case, the result is pedantic and - the ultimate sin - boring.  The main character was not exciting nor interesting - just smart.  The great experiment and the result were so-so.  I kept waiting for something - ANYTHING - to happen but soon realized that this was it..a globe that was tested, studied and explored. I am reminded of the poem..."this is how the world ends - not with a bang but with a whimper.&quot 
 The last warrior, I would have to say this is by far the worst movie that Dolph has ever been in. The plot was laughable and really made no sence at all. The cast was terrible. I would not recommend this movie to anyone 
 Everyone keeps telling me this is a classic.  I think it's just awful.  It reads like it was written: a rambling, unedited, ill-considered, weakly plotted piece of whimsy jotted down by an ailing old lady... was riding her reputation here - Macabea is just someone who comes and goes.  This novel just isn't finished 
 It took me a long time to get past the first few pages of this book.  I kept putting it down and picking it up again because I thought it might improve if I got far enough into it.  Wrong!  The premise of two lawyers, one who was out of work for a few months and now lands a job as a Manhattan ADA, and the other who's hoping to make partner in a high powered firm is dull and predictable.  Sara Tate, the new kid on the block in the DA's office gets a volatile case that will either make or break her career.  Her naivete in dealing with the worst criminal element in New York is laughable.  Her husband, Jared Lynch, spends more time kissing butt trying to make partner than practicing law.  It's self-obsessed Yuppies at their finest.  Overall, this book was disappointing at best.  Weak plot line, terrible ending, and too many neurotic, self-absorbed characters.  Do yourself a favor -- watch a rerun of L.A. Law instead of reading this book.  Actors Harry Hamlin and Susan Dey play similar roles to the characters in this book and you will find that they are much more believable and entertaining 
 This book basically tells you alot of boring stuff. It takes the fun out  of Ancient Eygpt. It talks alot of who discovered what and when, more then  anything else, atleast that's what I saw. I stopped reading it after it  went on and on about people discovering the stuff. I mean, sure, we'd like  to know who discovered it, but we would like to learn more about what they  discovered, and what it means etc. This book is probably the worst I have  ever gotten 
 This is book was a waste of time for me. While reading it, I stuck with it because I was hoping that it would have an ending that would make it worth it, but that doesn't ever happen. The ultimate flaw with the book is that it pretends as if its offering some kind of revolutionary ideology and it doesn't. It also suffers in that it makes allegations and criticisms, without backing them up, or offering solutions. The book comes off as some sort of weird propaganda, which makes it really hokey. Do yourself a favor and read something else. 
 I purchased two of these, one for each of my sons. I received them quickly and the packaging was in good shape. When we took the first one out and tightened the handlebars and so on to get it ready to charge and ride everything seemed ok. But the wires where you plug the charger into the 4 wheeler had to tightened and so did the place you turned the key to change speeds. Got it charging, we think. Then we start on the second one. We take it out and the charger is half melted. Ok, not too good but since we ordered two we thought we could just use the charger from the other one since they were the same. Well, when we plugged the charger to the second four wheeler after about 1 hour we went back out to the garage where it was charging and the charger we were using that had come with the first four wheeler had started to melt! Nevermind that the house could have caught on fire! So apparently someone had plugged the original charger in and that had already happened, rather than someone just having packaged a defective charger. Nice for someone to pack it back up and send it to me used and defective. The first four wheeler turned on and ran ok for a few minutes so it must have been charged, we went ahead and plugged it up as the instructions said - as if we had received it brand new like we thought we had. When it was used the first time it ran for a little over an hour, with only the the light popping out of the front with every little bump. And the light didn't work. While trying to re-attach the light we found several places that needed to be tightened up. We can't re-charge it though because the only good charger between the two was melted. When we first took these out of the boxes they were small (big enough for a 3 or 4 year old) but they looked pretty sturdy, much better than the plastic ones you get from Walmart, and I paid close to the same amount. They were difficult to get out of the packaging, because there is a metal frame in the box that needed to be taken apart, but that should have been good, to protect during shipping. However when you think about how you are going to get them back in the metal frame and box and shipping to send them back so someone can possibly see how bad the whole mess is you start to get cranky and tired. I will admit that I haven't tried to return them. I am quite worried that it will be as much trouble as these things have been already. I am tempted though, because I would like to let people know about this type of problem before they waste their money. Imagine how dissapointed I was that right before Christmas I couldn't give the kids two of their bigger gifts because they were junk. I am VERY upset. So now several hundred dollars (times two) that could have bought very nice Christmas presents just flushed down the drain. 
 This documentary is poorly produced, has terrible sound quality and stereotypical "life affirming" stories.  There was nothing in here to support Wal-Mart, their business practices or their philosophy

 If you have had to take out a mortgage to buy a house, have ever purchased life insurance or have a retirement account, this book will seem extremely basic. There aren't really any tools, worksheets or practical plans here. The book is simply a series of "Tips" -- very brief articles from different financial planners. It's a readable format, but there's not much meat.  For example, the section on "Software for Staying Organized" includes mention of only 3 software products, two of which are Microsoft Money and Intuit Quicken. The author starts her comments saying "The basic/standard versions are entry-level products designed for people new to personal finance software" (My experience with the basic versions of those programs is that they include quite powerful analysis and budgeting tools).    If you're just starting out or really need a primer, this is a readable book and comes well recommended. But if you are reasonably literate in working with lenders and insurance companies, you'll find this too simple 
 This is an attemp by Gull records to cash in on the Judas Priest name. This album and Hero, Hero are unauthorized, substandard reissues of the first two Judas Priest albums Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings Of Destiny. The sound Quality sucks and there is no new material on these that you won't get on the actual albums, which are still available through Cdnow/Amazon. Support Judas Priest, the best heavy metal band of all time, and don't waste your money on this crap. Buy the real thing Rocka Rolla and Sad Wings Of Destiny. 
 A poory written, racially charged work by a bitter, probably mentally ill schoolteacher that gives the illusion of having a "key" to historical development. In addition to the cycle of history thesis, he identifies eight civilizations and their birth to death cycle, Spengler points to a nation's "will" and race as the key to a "kultur's" success.   This is the sort of crank theory that held an appeal to National Socialists and amateur history buffs for whom decline mythology holds an attraction-- facts be damned.   Interesting as an historical footnote but dismissed by anyone with a serious foundation in history and historical analysis. 
 Don't let the cover fool you, this film isn't half as fun as you may hope it is. Maybe it's my own fault, but I was expecting something more like "Groove", or at least something interesting to watch. And it's not for my lack of knowledge of the bands, I often listen to Joy Division/New Order/Happy Mondays, and more from that scene. However, this seemed much more like the story of Tony Wilson and The Factory, than it did about the music, and almost came-off as a documentary. I almost stopped watching it out of boredom, but saw it through anyway. Now I wouldn't call this bad, it had it's good parts, just not many. 
 The seat is fun to play with, but that is also the problem. My son was so distracted with the features and songs he NEVER sat still long enough to go to the bathroom 
 The book is good scholarship in that it presents a myriad of facts about a myriad of organizations and movements. However, it is also extremely bad scholarship in that the author is unable to make sense of his own research. The extensive facts become a cluttered maze, a complex puzzle the author is unable to fit together. The book is a good historical reference, but otherwise an a-theoretical work that offers little insight. The author would do well to reach out and read the work of others who apply a more analytical perspective to similar material. I am not trying to be insulting, but he seems to have no comprehension of the history he reports 
 Sleazy 70s exploitation film with some panache                                 features super-agent Ginger chasing down white slavers.

 I am rather confused that there are people who enjoyed this book.  The reviews criticizing the plot are a bit off I think - sure, it is wildly implausible and not always coherently organized, but it does have elements of originality.  The huge, massive problem that is so difficult to overlook is that the writing is dreadful.  By the sixth or seventh page, I was already appalled that this was a national book club selection.  Lots of cliches.  Lots of rambling, useless passages.  Frequently obvious and shallow in descriptions.  Attempts to introduce novel turns of phrase are usually gaudy and awkward.  Note that the book is from a minor press.  Note that the book is already heavily discounted by Amazon.  These are important signals that I shouldn't have looked over.  The book might have been salvagable, had the author tried to rewrite and if the editor had exerted any sort of influence over the dismal writing.  As currently written, it reads like a draft of a novel from someone's weekend writing group. 
 I ordered this and The Favorite Game, taking advantage of Amazons buy two and get a deal policy. I didn't like this book at all. It doesn't feel as natural as Favorite Game, it doesn't flow like FG and doesn't delieve like FG.  I don't know what Mister Cohen was trying to accomplish... James Joyce or Henry Miller lost generation of Montreal? The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is solely on my adoration of the author 
 I bought mine at the same Toys R' Us Sale and had the exact same issue. Both my husband and I own Trek bikes and it wouldn't work his bike at all. It fit on mine only to find out that my heels would hit the footrest of the carrier. I woulud only recommend buying if you have the patience to install it on your bike only to find out that it won't work comfortably while you're riding. Not to mention that my two year old is very tall and he didn't look comfortable in it anyway. The free helmet is way too small for his head. We've returned it and have yet to purchase a different one yet. I think we're going to a bike shop 
 If you're looking for an historical overview of the subject -- go elsewhere.   Unless you're fascinated by the etiology of the language which evolved on the subject matter, this is a very disappointing read on the subject of the terrorism in Argentina 
 this is not the eric clapton i know. when he does blues that is clapton. i wish he would do another blues like "from the cradle. 
 I have to wonder if the previous reviewers are writing about this particular book.  There are no "rhymes" and the letters of the alphabet do not run down the page.  I was quite disappointed when I received this book, since it was not what I expected.  The author could have invented more clever phrases than "Xylophone for Xmas" and "Nine in their nests".    I was not impressed 
 I got this for my little girl on her second Christmas. She played with it Christmas day and once in her room. The balls are hard for her to put in the hole at the top. She just started placing them on the slide (not through the top). She never used the panio keys and could not turn the wheel. Not much fun 
 I found it hard to enjoy - I miss melody and don't care for strange arrangements and jazz motifs 
 I was looking forward to reading this book.  Made it almost through Chapter 2 and decided I was done.  This book is more about J.P. Craven than it is about the Cold War and the courageous and commendable service that was provided by the Navy's Silent Service.  If you want to know about how Craven saved the world, this is the book for you otherwise it is a great disappointment.  Recommend reading (or re-reading) Blind Man's Bluff before opening this autobiography 
 The idea of the novel was the only thing that kept me going through the length of it.  Personally, I was disappointed with the writing, which was sparse (thoroughly lacking in detail), almost to the point of being childish.  The running joke throughout is a tired one: a foreign country boy dopily wondering at the amazing modern technology of our obviously more civilized and advanced society.  Funny, at first, but it grows old quickly, along with the story in general.  In all, a very unimpressive, strangely moralistic work that was kind of offensive for me as an Asian 
 This film is disappointing, considering the acting talent used in it.  The story is about a cop whose son gets into some trouble, and is supposedley framed.  His father, the cop (DeNiro) must try to stay within the boundaries of his job while at the same time clear his troubled sons name of the crime.  It is not very suspenseful and the end result, regardless what avenue they take, is dull.  There is no wonder for who really committed the crime, who framed who, or who will come out the victor in the end of the movie.  It just falls flat and it's to bad that DeNiro wasted his time and talents being in this film.  If you want some great crime drama films that push this to shame, try recent movies like Along came a spider, Man on Fire, or Collateral.  Deeper plots without the predictable outcomes 
 ...since writing this series in 1984.  Fresh from reading the Lions of Al-Rassan (pub. 1995), the Sarantine Mosaic (pub. 1998),  and the Last Light of the Sun (pub. 2004), with their subtle plots and characters, richly crafted world and religions, I thought that Kay could do nothing wrong.  Boy, was I ever wrong.  All the above qualities are glaringly absent here.  Instead of subtle characters, we have 5 heroes who constantly, and at length, reflect on their FEELINGS.  Yet, they manage to carry off all that tedious introspection without ever, well, coming to life.  The contrast with George RR Martin or later Kay POV passages could not be more marked.  For example, if I was a Toronto college student, suddenly lured on false premises into a deadly war, I would be quite a bit more upset and concerned about my safety than these guys.  Though maybe not quite as much as say, a Thomas Covenant (whose lengthy self-examinations, while repetitive, also make a lot more sense).  In later books, Kay will sometimes end a chapter with something like "And he suddenly realized what he had to do" and leave you reflecting on which possible decision the protagonist will choose, based on all the insight you have into his behavior and motivations.  In Fionavar, these cliffhangers happen much more frequently.  Likely as not, the protagonist will then, for no reason at all, based on no information known to the reader, run off to a location not yet introduced, to do something earthshaking entirely out of the blue.  Perhaps the characters behave that way because they are destined to do so.  The role of fate, personified by the Tapestry, becomes more pronounced in the concluding book of the trilogy.  Yet, that is a subtle point and hardly justifies the inane storywriting throughout.  Fionavar itself has a cliche good-vs-evil backstory, "inspired" by Tolkien and Celtic legends.  Geographically, characters zoom off from one end to the other in hours, by teleportation if necessary, to further the "plot".   The result is that you it feels more like an adventure around a big city/theme park and its surroundings than a real world, with real features and real people.    The religious aspect involves various gods frequently interacting with mortals and Rakoth Maugrim, the bad guy, makes Sauron look like an in depth character study.  Everything comes off as archetypical, rather than realistic.  That might have been the intent, but did not make this series any more pleasurable for me.  I really can't say that Kay should be ashamed of it, because he has since matured into one of Fantasy's best writers.  But Fiorana was not a promising start by any means.  And no, books 2 and 3 aren't all that much better either 
 I watched this movie with no particular bias about Wal-Mart. I understand this movie is made in the same way political ads are, where they try really hard to skew the facts to make the viewer have an emotional reaction to the half of the story that is provided. I think that for most people it is highly effective, but it didn't work for me.  I think this is an excellent movie to show as an example of skew, perspective, and propaganda.  When they talk about the sweatshops in China and Honduras I found myself --though I dont envy the workers-- laughing at the movie.  I used to live in China and I have been to many factories and the conditions that they make seem exclusive are universal over there.  It is the film makers and then the ex-employees (and they are assuming the viewers) who are putting their cultural assumptions about how sad it is that they work so hard and get paid so little, but in other countries that is a fact of life that has nothing to do with Wal-Mart. That is a cultural and governmental problem within the countries where the factories exist, not only a problem with Wal-Mart.  The movie also discuss how Wal-Mart employees are a burden to the government because of the fact that Wal-Mart pays very  little and then suggests that it's employess go on public assitance, but the truth is that is the same for the fast-food companies and everywhere else that pays minimum wage and offers little benefits.   I do believe Wal-Mart should morally proivide their employees with more wages and provide more full-time positions, but that is a business culture that expands well past Wal-Mart. I am a teacher who cannot work more than 17 hours a week so they do not have to give me benefits, but I don't see anyone trying to make movies to ban schools. 
 Usually when someone writes a 'cookbook', it's because they have something special to share.  This book (booklet is more appropriate) is essentially worthless if you have any other barbeque book around.  I own many BBQ books and like to cross reference them to see how each makes a particular item.  This little book does not get checked, as it adds nothing to the mix.  This is not the first time I've wasted $5.95 in my lifetime.  I suggest you don't waste your money or time with this booklet.  It borders on being a ripoff 
 Ive sent this book as a gift. My friend in turn is lending it out very popular. Covers alot  great for kids to understan 
 I bought this book because I wanted to read the Gospel Of Thomas. What I got was Elaine Pagels recollections of the Catholic Church and a short history. All of which would have been fine if I was not looking to read the Gospel of Thomas. Other wise it is not a horrible book, just not what I was in the market for. 
 I've noticed that one reviewer pointed to Richard Pollak's biography of the author, "The Creation of Dr. B," as a source of information on Bruno Bettelheim's legitimacy as a psychoanalyst (or lack thereof).  I would second that recommendation.  Before reading "The Uses of Enchantment," one should be aware that large portions of this book were brazenly plagiarized from other sources, such as Julius Heuscher's "A Psychiatric Study of Fairy Tales: Their Origin, Meaning and Usefulness."  Several passages were lifted directly from this work, published in 1963 (more than a decade before Bettelheim began writing "The Uses of Enchantment"), and barely even paraphrased.  Heuscher was cited only once by Bettelheim, and not for any of these virtually direct quotes.  I would think long and hard before taking anything Bettelheim attempted to pass off as his own work seriously 
 The meta-story of this film was potentially interesting, but only before the gathering of the bad actors of the roundtable.   One star each for Cross and Black, whose genuine talent are the only reasons to bother glancing at this movie. Unless you are the type to grow an emotional bond with unlikeable characters, whose masturbatory storytelling is untinteresting and unbelievable, I would recommend you spend ninety minutes of your life doing anything other than watching Melvin Goes to Dinner 
 Those of us old enough to be familiar with a range of "rabbit classics" immediately realized, I am sure, that The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane is a cobbled together rip-off of several classics. The most obvious, of course, is the "Velveteen Rabbit," who makes his sad journey toward being a "real rabbit." But, of course, DiCammillo makes Edward Tulane a CHINA rabbit with velvety ears, rather than a velveteen bunny, and his owner a little girl instead of a little boy. The book and its illustrations are even packaged to "look like" a Velveteen Rabbit-type classic. In short, a "classic knock off."     Then, of course, there is the fact that he is a jauntily dressed bunny who owns a pocket watch. Remember Alice in Wonderland/Through the Lookingglass? Bunny with waistcoat and pocketwatch.     And let's not forget the movie "Harvey," in which there is the very vain invisible rabbit who is six feet tall. Dicamillo compromises and makes Edward 3 feet high.       Oh, yes, and then there's "Watership Down," the bunny tale for older readers that recounts a harrowing rabbit journey and includes much dark violence.       Dicamillo seems determined to throw in everything that seems to be a "sure seller," from ripping off classic elements, to weaving in violence, and finally, religious elements.       In short, "Miraculous Journey" is a fine example of today's publishing philosophy:  Packaging and marketing are everything, content (and originality) are distant seconds 
 Other reviewers baffle me.    The metaphors are syrupy, the advice either obvious or suspect, and everything a dash too cute.  Anecdotes bore, ramble, though some of the quotes are interesting.  What use the technical advice may have had is probably gone with time, and what remains handy is rather obvious.    Some of the discussion on particular pieces may be useful for those actually playing them at present; I'm not, but even if I were, I'm not sure I could stomach the prose again.  I love the piano, too, truly, and it's always nice to share thoughts with someone with similar feelings, but Cooke's fondness for the instrument verges on the pedophilic 
 The foundation of success in a horror story is a strong, original beginning.  The author must grab your attention and earn your suspension of disbelief.  Dean Koontz failed to make this upfront investment in The Taking.  The story caroms off of a long series of hackneyed horror elements - stormy night, body snatchers, magic mirrors, ghouls, and (Koontz's favorite) Delphic dogs - before settling down with a very modest storyline about a non-denominational rapture.    Koontz can usually be counted on to deliver some pleasant thrills or humor if not the chills of real horror.  But The Taking provides no such return 
 Once again, the authors at Prima have outdone themselves and set a new low.  The game is fantastic and deserves a much better strategy guide than this.  The shortcomings in this book are numerous, but I'll attempt to list them all here.  It lacks a complete move list for the weapons, it has no useful enemy information, it doesn't describe what the items are or do, it doesn't give the location of all of the Golden Scarabs (which are critical to unlock the original NG games), and the "strategy" is minimal at best.  Make no mistake, this is a bare-bones walkthrough with blurry pictures that is the product of minimal effort.  This book is reminiscent of something George W. would author if he had his crayons, paper and two hours to kill.  How does Prima keep getting book contracts?  They must have been the low bidder, which is reflected in the quality of this "guide".  Needless to say, this book is woefully incomplete and is certainly not worth the $10.49 Amazon is asking for it.  You are much better off getting a free guide on gamefaqs.com that is complete.  Prima should be embarrassed by this substandard product, but as long as it sells well and they don't get too many consumer complaints, their strategy won't change 
 This book offers absolutely NOTHING NEW about how best to deal with people.  You can get much more from an article in Workforce magazine or even Fast Company.  Hire the best people you can afford and then let them be who you hired them to be.  If you want some good advice about dealing with employees, check out "Love 'Em or Lose 'Em," a classic 
 From page 168, "serialization delay is not covered because its influence on delay is relatively minimal." Why do the authors think we need fragmentation? They seem to think it's needed because of propagation  delay. I don't think the authors understand "Voice over IP  Fundamentals.&quot 
 I thought since this was form the AAP that it would be the best reference. Not even close. It is difficult to read because it is in 6pt type. It looks like they just shrunk down the original Hard copy and tried to size it to a paperback. As a result, the text is tiny and only fills up 2/3 of the page! The book measures 6 X 9, but the reading area is 4 1/2 X 6 1/4!!It does not look at all like what you see when you take a peek on the website. The illustrations are very few and of poor quality. The information is from 1997. There was a LOT missing, especially since there have been advances in pediatrics in the last 8 years. The information is not very helpful as far as relieving symptoms, and is geared toward older children. There are so many references out there today that are MUCH better than this book. This is the first time I have EVER returned a book. I am extrememly disappointed. Please continue to browse - there are a lot of choices out there that are more complete and better organized than this. 
 I subscribed to this magazine in January for my husband.  It took 5 months to get the first magazine, then I never recieved another one 
 story line: not for young kids, and not even really good for older kids. she has to try to fit in with the cool kids. whatever. i hate that an animated kid movie took on the teenage ideals of teenage movies. (!!!!!)  animation: sucks. was expecting every other barbie movie animation. those look amazing, this was verrrrrry poor 
 To say that this guidebook is lacking would be a bit of an understatement, unfortunately. Why? Because, for example, it includes absolutely NO coverage of one of South Korea's larger cities, Ulsan, which is famous for being the home of the international Hyundai motor company, and was also one of the host cities during the World Cup in 2002. The population is over 1 million people, and to think that such a significant (if slightly industrial) city could be overlooked is proof that the authors of this guide have only scratched the surface of what Korea has to offer the world. Otherwise, I have to give them credit for producing a guide for the country AT ALL, considering that there are hardly any worth buying out that now as it is. I just recommend that for the next edition they do a little more research before publishing it 
 Yes, actually I do. To warn potential readers from reading the most crappy book in the face of the Earth. Gerald betraying his adored Ellen? Mammy betraying her most loved mistress? Ashley being gay? (Since when is dereaming gayness? And didn't he love Melanie?) Melanie killing a slave out of anger? (This offended me the most, because I have always loved Melanie) Rhett prefering this lame loser wannabe to Scarlett?  It's an insult to GWTW.An insult to Margaret Mitchell. An insult to the south.  Just because some plantations had mullattos doesn't mean everyone had to.  If you have read GWTW, don't let this horrible, disgusting object cheat you out of your time, or your love for one of the most beautiful books of American literature 
 Although the author purports to take an objective view of what he calls the clash of cultures in Postville, his portrait of the conflicts in the town are in no way nuanced or thoughtful. Clearly his ambivalence about his own religious identity has shaped his perception of life in Postville. The author has not taken the time to learn about the Orthodox Jewish traditions he so smugly and sanctimoniously dismisses as "guilt-producing." He manages to reduce his concept of  meaningful Judaism to bagels, lox, and pastrami. By the end of the book I found myself wondering why he  had bothered to identify himself as Jewish since his view of the religious traditions he derides seem so superficial to him. To me the book failed the basic test of intellectual honesty and clarity of thought. It was in addition, poorly written 
 Be aware that this book is no longer in copyright and anybody can print and sell this book. I bought this book at Amazon and the print is small with poor font clarity. My zeal for the Lord could not overcome the headaches from trying to read this book. The small "a" is usually filled with ink for example. Buy Clarence Larkin books published by the Clarence Larkin Estate which still keeps all of Rev. Larkins' books in print. They still produce the books from plates instead of a copy machine that needs cleaning. May the people of Sun Publishing join the lake of fire yaht club as galley-slaves for Apollyon 
 This was just embarrasing to watch, this guy is so uncool. this DVD was released in late 2006, and this guy is making jokes about a Cher video that came out in 1989. I bet some people watching this weren't even born when that came out. What other cutting edge jokes does he have? Beverly Hills 90210. When was that popular, around 1991? And Jackie Chan? Who cares? I didn't laugh once, and actually got up to turn off the DVD and throw it in the trash. The voices would be kind of funny for a minute, but he runs them into the ground. 
 Even though I was forewarned that Benford went down his own galactic wormhole with the storyline, I thought--as an Asimov fan--how far can he go with such a great foundation (no pun intended). Well he went pretty far a field but there is hope!  If you think skipping chapters is sacrilege go ahead and try to read the first two or three chapters that deal with the SIMs. If you have the same reaction many of the rest of us had--have no fear. Just skip ahead to the next chapter. Trust me--in this case it's allowed and you're not missing much. You can simply fill in the blanks in the story with "a random event occurred here that caused chaos" (kind of mental spackle job) and then go right back to the main storyline without missing a beat and spending too much time on the overblown SIM plotline which frankly Asimov would not ever have condoned writing. (Shame on the Estate)  The second book (thankfully) picks up the story well and in spite of the fact that Bear has to deal clean up the mess from book one he gets back to the roots quickly.   But if you're like me and feel morally compelled to read Book 1 before you crack the cover on 2 or 3, at least skip over the SIM chapters and get to nirvana faster. 
 The Good Neighbor explores the relationship between new neighbors: a gay couple (hypermasculine Will and sensitive Rory) and a married coulple (Meg, a tough, career obsessed lawyer and Austin who takes care of their two sons between jobs). Rory and Austin are at home most days in their beautiful gated community in Southern Florida. Nature takes it's course & repressed Austin falls for Rory.  As with Quinn's last novel,"Back Where It Started," the main characters are totally defined by their sexual positions in the bedroom. Will's nickname is bruit; Rory is sexy and refined; Meg is too bust working to entertain thoughts about sex; Austin falls for Rory, plays the sexual dominate role & gets his old job back.  The most depressing news came at the end: Jay Quinn is "at work on his next novel." I gave this novel two stars (rather than one) only because I was able to read it all the way through. You can guess the end within 75 pages or less 
 The book gives a brief account of the experience of Chinese prostitutes in nineteenth-century San Francisco. During that period many Chinese women migrated to the United States and and sold their bodies for economic improvement. They daily encounter racism, discrimination, exploitation, and violence. The biggest weakness of the book is that all the facts are contradictary to the thesis. Although the author attempts to challenge the stereotype  of the Chinese prostitutes as hapless victims of economic, racial, and sexual exploitation, the stories in the book have failed to support its argument. Presenting only the misery and sufferings of the prostitutes at the hand of men, the excessive details of those immigrants' unpleasant experience in the American West contradict the thesis. There is no evidence of "unsubmissive women" in the book at all. It just reinforce the stereotype. Many portions of the book seem to be simply a collection of various unsorted episodes with no analysis. The research is incomplete. The author's incapability to read any document in Chinese has greatly hampered his research and also limited his knowledge about Chinese immigration history. In general, this is a poorly researched, weakly argued, carelessly written book. Agreeing with many other professional reviewers, I don't recommend this work to the general audience 
 Hello,  I recently bought this blood pressure monitor.....it functions all well......BUT it gives incorrect readings.......i mean the readings vary significantly........not once , twice...but many many times......I was and am never sure about the validity of the readings..... Purchase this at your own risk.....my recommnedation would be to get a manual blood pressure monitor like the one with the doctors.....atleast u will know that the readings r genuine...and u can ALWAYS find someone who can spare 5 minutes and help u get the readings...... Take care and stay healthy...... 
 As a teacher, I feel that this book can benefit all of my students in their quest for freedom as described by Tarthang Tulku. I especially recommend this resource for persons interested in learning more about their internal mechanisms or patterns of conditioning. This book has helped me learn what Freedom is really about in contrast to our president and others who base their understanding of freedom on religious beliefs, insecurities and prejudices 
 I bought this book hoping to use it in the classroom.  I was so disappointed.  It is extremely long that a student gets bored with it after just a few pages.  The storyline of the book sounded great, but I did not know it would be written with difficult syntax structure.  The illustrations are not very interesting to younger kids either.  I think this book would only be relevant to those very very very interested in the U.S. expansion and to those who want a challenge of trying to read through each page for comprehension 
 Like the vast majority of books on "the end times" this one is pure religious science fiction.   For a Scripturally sane and classically Christian view I recommend LAST DAYS MADNESS by Gary Demar, THE BEAST OF REVELATION by Kenneth Gentry Jr., DAYS OF VENGEANCE by David Chilton [just reprinted!] THE GREATNESS OF THE GREAT COMMISSION by Kenneth Gentry Jr., POSTMILLENIALISM: AN ESCHATOLOGY OF HOPE by Keith A. Mathison and HE SHALL HAVE DOMINION: A POSTMILLENIAL ESCHATOLOGY by Kenneth Gentry Jr.   These books fully engage and Scripturally refute the lunatic ravings which have prevailed since the days of Scofield and Darby 
 It was all I could do to finish this book. The subject matter interested me because I knew someone who committed suicide, so I was curious as to how a humorous spin could be put on such a dismal subject matter. There was some funny dialog, but I was disappointed in this book overall. The characters were unlikeable: an abnoxious teenager, a wimpy middle-aged woman, etc. Not only were the characters totally annoying, they didn't like each other - yet they kept hanging out together. Yeah, I get the whole idea that they were depressed and had no one else to hang out with or anything else to do, but the author didn't convince me of why they would want to keep meeting up, going on vacation together, etc. There were also some rediculous threads in there, like lying about the angel on top of the building. That was when the book started to lose me.   I made it through to the end, but it was a great effort and I just skimmed the last 75 pages or so 
 I was given this book and I dedicated a whole day reading it to see if there was something memorable about this story, but NO there's nothing good about this awful book. The characters are flat, no depth or character development, the story lacked passion and it has an undefined plot... This is the worst book I have read so far this year. I swear I never throw books away but this time, I tore it apart and threw it away as the worst trash ever.  Imagine this 6th rate soap opera, the main character's mother left her and her father behind when she finds out that her husband's real love of his life was her own mother, that would be the main character's grandmother...  No taste whatsoever and simply it's impossible to recommend. Don't get this book, you'll just feel cheated with it's trashy story and characters full of voids. 
 I bought this boat for my son when he was 8 months old.  He liked the boat well enough...even played with it when it was sitting on dry land.  However, in the water, this boat is VERY tippy, requiring two adult hands AT ALL TIMES.  Not good if you have more than one kid and NEED that extra hand.  I bought a much sturdier boat that still of course needs constant supervision but is great and can be used for more than one summer.  I wouldn't recommend anyone put their baby in this boat 
 The first time we played this game, when initially going to the "Contestant's Row" section, it put the same prize up, oh, I don't know - maybe 13 out of 20 times? This is one of the most blatant bugs you can have in a piece of software. In fact, I can't even go on enough as to how horrible this is - if I could get into negative numbers on handing out stars I would. Was there a testing team when this product was developed, or were they permanently out to lunch, playing Halo, or both? Would you like to know how easy it is to write code that WON'T show you the same product 13 out of 20 times when you return to Contestant's Row? It looks something like this:  Randomize Call ContestRow() Function ContestRow()  prize_number = Int((100 * Rnd) + 1)  DisplayPrize(prize_number) End Function  Function DisplayPrize(number)  wscript.echo number End Function   Doesn't look so big of task, does it? That is if you are a software developer. If I wrote code like the people that developed this game I would never sell anything due to the frequent requests of my customers to return their money, which leads me to believe that this product's software development was perhaps left in the hands of the Director of Marketing in an effort to cut costs? Or maybe it was the janitor...    
 As sweeping generalities go, this book ranks high in its attempt to use ambiguities as a replacement for specifics. In essence the book argues for the pre-eminence and necessity of being "hard" in order for America to be great. Michael Barone, former editor of U.S. News and World Report bounces around from topic to topic, settling on various issues long enough to throw out simple analyses that justifies the importance of being hard in the face of being "soft." The reader may interject the terms "conservative" for "hard" and "liberal" for "soft." I disagree with his generalities: the issue is two-fold when determining the best policy. The first issue is to find balance between the opposition. Few ideologies taken to an extreme are valuable. The Confucian ideal of finding the value in the middle of two ideas at odds with one another is valuable in an increasingly polarized world. The second issue is to actually go out on a limb and suggest that a specific ideological approach has value in certain situations; as these fluid situations change so must our ideologies. Nothing that exists in stasis, even religion, will survive without adaptation and change 
 I had high hopes for this guide, since it is basically the only one and the previous version is out of date.  But this version is no different.  The length of the practice tests is not the same as what the actual tests will be.  I have not yet taken the written exam, but if the foreign service's website is any guide (and one would think it would be), the questions that this book asks are not representative of what is on the actual exam.  But worse yet, there are TYPOS in the practice tests, including in what the book judges to be correct answers. These typos are such that, on some questions, it is impossible to determine the "correct" answer because they are all wrong (and then if you look in the answers, you see what they actually meant to print).  And these were the same mistakes as in the previous edition!  Did they even try to improve it?  I am very disappointed. (Incidentally, the tests are all the same as the previous edition, so don't bother getting this book for extra practice.)  You're better off sticking to the FSO website 
 This movie is no "Heathers."  It's not even "Mean Girls."  As hard as it tried to be witty, shocking, dark, and satirical, it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop.  Maybe I'm just too old for this drivel -- although I could watch "Clueless" and "The Craft" until my DVD player breaks -- but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push, I just didn't get it.  The movie wasn't funny (which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses, Carol Kane, couldn't even elicit a smile out of me), the plot was full of holes, and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived.  I wasn't expecting greatness when I watched Jawbreakers, but I was at least hoping for 1 1/2 hours of mindless entertainment.  Unfortunately, the "entertainment" piece was dropped and I was just left with "mindless. 
 A very disappointing book, and again, makes me very wary of any item on a "New York Times Best Seller List" or any other list, and really any big name reviewer recommendation.  This book has one 50 page chapter which is excellent - the recap of the Thompson "Shot heard around the world" homerun. If you are a baseball fan as I am, that (barely) made the book worthwhile. The other 700 pages are disjoint, incomprehensible, and really trivial. You come away thinking "I really don't care bout this stuff" - I don't care about the dynamics of trash, about J Edgar Hoover's bathroom habits, Klara Sax's artistic depression and annoying infatuations about roof tops, about characters that just don't have much depth to really care about. At the end, even potentially interesting characters like Albert (the one on the baseball quest) become hard to bear. The whole book in fact had the feel of going to a senior citizen home.  I read this book, as perhaps others did, expecting a book about the mafia or about other figures in the underworld. What I got was a book with a good first chapter, some interesting tidbits here and there about how life used to be in the 50's (fear of nuclear weapons, duck and cover classroom exercies), and a lot of knowledge about the trash business.   The "masterful" epilogue, as other reviewers call it, really does no justice to a reader who has spent so much time toiling over Delillo's ragtag story telling. I am ok with stream of consciousness writing, or nonchronological chapters, or even random chapters, but the methods used in thsi book served no purpose other than to further make the reading difficult.   Was this book about how mundane our lives are versus the bigger things that occur around us? Or how each of us is on an individual quest? Or that the 50's-60's-70's-80's were just years of fear, and the 90's are years of greed? I am still unsure, I still don't think any of these themes came across well.  Please - not pretending to be a sophisticate, intellectual, or professional critic - but this book is really not worth the time or effort. You can be staisfied by a number of other books, including the "The Corrections" by Franzen or "The Cold Six Thousand" by Ellroy  which cover a similar period or similar themes and do not make you so frustrated or disappointed at the end.  Read the first chapter, then put the book down or you will be sorely disappointed and have wasted an awful lot of time.  
 The book certainly had occasional interesting points. The author does know his history. The story could have been told in 400 pages. 
 Unless Amazon sent me the wrong one (i disposed of the wrapper before finding out) this model doens't even come close to fitting a Dell 15.4" screen. 
 I really wish I could recommend this book. I love the idea of capturing Romans and using them as soldiers on other worlds. However, the writing style is so disjointed and hard to follow, that I found myself struggling to stay with it, instead of flowing with it and really enjoying myself.  Drake will begin a paragraph with a sentence describing some object in the scene. Then he will start writing about something completely different for the rest of the paragraph, and maybe a whole page, before going back to the original object. By the time he gets around to writing about the object, you have started to forget the original context. Reading this book requires a lot of re-reading to make sure you follow what is going on.  Another problem is that there are no chapter breaks. The book is divided into mini-books that are much longer than most chapters. So there aren't many good places to take a break and rest your tired mind (and it DOES get tired after struggling to follow the text).  Finally, the book doesn't have an interesting pacing structure. Until the final 50 pages, the book feels very monotone, empty of build ups, climaxes, dramatic slow moments etc...  This is another factor in the difficult reading. without the minor buildups, fast-paced action, and slow dramatic moments, it all starts to blend together into, one, long, droning, narrative.  And then the end hits you.  Its like Drake came back after a long recess. The writing style seems totally different. The final 50 pages are actually entertaining and much easier to follow than the vast majority of the book. But then it ends. Its so suddenly that I was angry. I plowed through all 250+ pages of mediocrity, finally hit the good part, and then it ended in what seems like mid chapter.  I can not recommend this book unless you are a die hard Drake fan 
 This book is a REPRINT, so it was originaly written in a completely different fashion time. The fashion clothes and tips in this book were extremely outdated. Betty Halbreich is an elder so she really doesn't give fashion advice that would fit for someone that is under the age of 30 
 I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE CAST OF THIS MOVIE DRESSED UP AS HOT DOGS AND THROWN INTO A CAGE WITH STAR JONES AND MARV ALBERT. (... 
 Warning!! Talbott and Cynaumon are con artists! Corti-Slim is utterly worhtless.  Do Not waste your money. 
 I wish I could give this a higher grade, but I just can't.  This book is mediocre at best.  I did finish it, but wasn't even happy that I did.  I thought the characters were flat and uninteresting (with the exception of Bixby Mason), and couldn't help but smirk at some of their stupid names (i.e. Wim.  I doubt I will ever meet a "Wim" in real life!).  My favorite Danielle Steel novels are "The Gift" and "Safe Harbour".  I empathized with those characters more and was moved by those stories.  If you like books with more depth and substance, give those a try 
 Whenever Clint Willis finally gets around to compiling a book about hating Saddam Hussein and Osama bin-Laden, then Clint and his cronies might have some credibility. As it is, their blind hatred and knee-jerk reactionary attitudes against Conservatives have produced reams of commentary...loopy, mean-spirited, small-minded ideas that are fundamentally wrong about nearly everything in the world. These pundits' loathing of Conservatism has blinded them against the real enemies of America and freedom. Ironically, it's the Conservatives who provide the strength, vision, and courage to defend the rights of Liberals to spew their opinions. Hatred...that's what this book is. At least truth in advertising is in effect here. 
 Alot of it sounded like some of his old stuff and some songs sounded the same its a shame because I am a fan of BLS,SDMF 
 The canopy bar broke only two days after Christmas.   Now I have a sharp end on the bed frame.  Not good for little fingers.  For the price, I thought it would have been a lot more sturdy 
 Denzel Washington (The Manchurian Candidate, Man of Fire) plays a police chief in Banyan Key, Fl where he is sleeping with Sanaa Lathan (Brown Sugar) who is married to Dean Cain (Tv's Lois & Clark, Rat Race) and bascially Lathan finds out she's dying and she has some many months to live, which then she gives Washington part of the money if she dies. Soon after, Lathan goes missing, maybe dead and that's when the big kickaroo happens when someone frames him, so Washington goes around trying to correct things, trying not to be caught for something he didnt do. He also has a sexy cop partner, played by Eva Mendes. Some fun in this, including a hilarious John Billingsley (Tv's Angel, White Oleander, High Crimes) as Washington's beer drinking buddy and Washington saves this from being a complete disaster, there's also a nice sequence where Washington falls out a window onto a balcony as it comes apart and he has to climb back up. Mendes is hot but she doesnt show anything here and casting Lathan as the femme fatale was a big miscasting. Also starring Nora Dunn (Three Kings, The Hebrew Hammer). Sweet locations help to but the plot is weak 
 If Metallica's beer-drinking lead singer called this one of his favorite albums because of its "gory details", then you know something must be wrong.  This is one of Mr.Cave's weakest albums not only because some of the lyrics are simply too cheesy to take them seriously(unless you're a goth teenager), but also because Cave made this record just to have fun with his buddies and girlfriends. The band never went on tour to support this album; they were exhausted after the Lollapalooza and Henry's Dream tours. They needed to relax. And that is exactly what they did in "Murder Ballads". The only good thing about this album was the fact that Mr.Cave and his Seeds got a wider exposure here in the U.S. without having to sell out. If I'm giving "Murder Ballads" two stars is simply because "Stagger Lee" is way too cool. Specially live. Check out Your Funeral, My Trial, Tender Prey, or The Good Son if you really want to know what made Nick Cave and the Bad Seed legends.  
 I have mixed feelings about this quasi-romance novel about an American teacher named Hope and Po-yu (Paul), her Chinese student. On one hand, it was often very interesting, as Ms. Liu gives a lot of historical detail about San Francisco and China. On the other hand, the characters were rather shallow. I didn't find Hope, who oddly resembled a whiny yuppie of the present day, particularly appealing. Po-yu was far more interesting, and was portrayed with some complexity and depth. The romance between Hope and Po-yu rang false for me. ("Honey, I first fell in love with you when I realized it was required for the plot to progress!") I still can't see what attracted them to each other. Also, did anyone else notice that any slight against Hope is recorded with meticulous detail (the rampant racism against Chinese at that time seems glossed over in comparison although it is mentioned), but Ms. Liu has some pretty crude stereotypes in this novel: a hearty blonde Swede, a drunk, surly Irishwoman, and Hope's one-sided-ly disagreeable mother-in-law to name a few. Also, she takes some pretty cheap shots at two groups it is still politically correct to demonize: all the Britons in the book are "right-o, jolly-good" bigots, and all the Christians are consistently hypocritical, or stupid, or both. In addition, much of the middle of the book is bogged down in political discussions that try so hard to be interesting that they're just the opposite. And to top it all off, the ending was forced. This novel could have been so much better: as this book is based on the lives of her grandparents, she obviously had some fascinating material to work with. And one more quibble: one of Hope and Po-yu's daughters is named Jennifer Pearl. In 1908 the name Jennifer pretty much existed in only one place in the world: Cornwall, UK 
 The photo is quite deceiving.  This suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap, shiny, and is horrible to the touch.  My three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness.  Spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit 
 These Folks are obviously exellent at playing their instruments. They do not,however have any sense of this music at all. Every piece is approached in the same way.This is the worst  recording of this music I've ever heard. There is no definative approach to this music,save the composers impromptu recordings. If you're interested in the music of Gurdjieff/DeHartmann-pass this one by.For more recent recordings,try Alain Kremski 
 It pains me to give American Aurora a relatively negative review, as the book was entertaining and well-prepared. I must do so, however, because the book offers only part of the story. James Thomas Callendar is one of the most amusing characters of early American history -- the forefather of folks like Walter Winchell and Matt Drudge, the first American "scandalmonger," as William Safire calls him. But he was motivated by money and personal pique, embracing and denouncing Washington, Adams, and Jefferson in turn to sell papers and whenever he felt one had slighted his ambitions. American Aurora focuses only on the period of the Alien and Sedition Acts and Callendar's campaign against Adams. The book makes Callendar out to be a John Peter Zenger-caliber hero of free expression, ignoring the fact that Callendar once praised Adams, and would later tarnish Jefferson -- Callendar's hero in American Aurora -- and breaking the story of Sally Hemings. This is a fun read. Too bad it's not the whole truth 
 Out of the past 20 burns, I have only had 10 DVD's burn successfully.  I use Roxio CD Creator version 7, which does a great job with my CD's, so I'm pretty sure it's the DVD media.  Not only am I wasting all my money, but my time as well.  I've tried to lower the burn speed, but it does not matter.  I'd try something else 
 So not at all what i was expecting. I had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it,i was terribly disappointed and confused.  
 Probably excellent for a child but no good for an adult beginner.  My mistake 
 I read exactly half the book and stopped.  Based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending, that was a good decision.  As it is there went hours of my life I won't get back!  The book is silly and laughable.  The premise sounded great - but the book is bad.  Really bad 
 Good book with understandable illustrations and practical suggestions 
 When I started reading this book, I was reminded of the excellent Silverberg's little novel "The World inside". However, a few more pages into Oath of Fealty and I had a shallow, epidermic, cardboard story that reads like a tv mini series. Stay away at all costs 
 In viewing the product, I thought the warmer also came with the cup... as most coffee warmers do.  The cup was actually the selling point; so, I what I thought I ordered was different than the actual which was only warmer itself.  It's a shame, the cup displayed is beautiful.  Oh well, live and learn 
 There is no other explanation. The following quote is all you really need to know to prove that Andrea is unstable and most likely hates who she is. "I want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high-heel shoved in his mouth, like an apple in the mouth of a pig." - Andrea Dworkin. If a man were to say something like this, I'm sure she'd call for his arrest. 
 Maybe this book would have been better if the illustrations were better & the colors weren't so off.  Our toddler was not interested in this book at all & I could see why.  This was not one of Wood's best books- try The Big Hungry Bear or King Bidgood's in the Bathtub.  But if you're interested in a book similar to Quick as a Cricket and one SO much better, get A Dragon in a Wagon, by Lynley Dodd 
 What happend to the firehouse of the early 90s?  This group went from a once hard rocking band to putting out shlock like Category 5.  If you are thinking about buying this because you enjoyed their earlier albums, be prepared to be dissapointed.  It's a bunch of mellow rock that I would expect to hear on a radio station in a dentist's office.  A station that plays Phil Collins, Sheryl Crow, and Bryan Adams 
 The other 1-star reviews are very accurate. For people who are attracted to this "Centering Prayer" please read books about "Lectio Divina". "Lectio Divina" is a true Catholic Christian tradition.  The Bible warns about falling into traps such as "Centering Prayer". The objective of Centering Prayer is a closeness to God. How can we get close to God without "works". We must love God with our whole mind, might, body, ACTIONS, intentions. We obtain salvation through Christ. It is the Christian objective to become like Christ - in the way we live.  We must do the corporal and spiritual acts of Mercy. "As you treat the least among you is how you treat me (Jesus)". Feed the poor, visit the sick, counsel the afflicted, admonish sinners, clothe the naked, ect 
 The idea behind the book is great, but the book itself fails to meet  expectations. The description on Native American life seemed  superficial  and like it had no experience or research behind it.  The charachters were  good, but the whole book seemed like a rough draft.The story never went  into enough detail. It jumped from one event to another without ever  spending enough time on each event to interest me.My advice is to skip it 
 I gagged my way through The Notebook but thought I would give Nicholas Sparks another try.  I read about 1/3 of the book and decided it was a waste of my time.  
 This is a rather peculiar film for Seagal, and the first thing that should be pointed out to any Seagal fan contemplating whether or not to give this one a try is that this is really not an action film.  Seagal only has a couple fight scenes in the whole film and they are all extremely brief.  In fact, they are extraordinarily brief, though thankfully free of wirefu.    Though Out of Reach is by no means a total failure (it's actually pretty entertaining, Seagal as always is fun to watch, and some of the scenes are well done), the script nevertheless exhibits some problems and plot holes.  This film is a drama about a nature nut (Seagal) who roams the forest looking for injured animals.  He has a pen pal in Poland, a young girl, and when he hears that she will no longer be able to correspond with him he becomes so upset that he travels abroad to look for her, even though he really has no reason to suspect that anything is wrong with her.  This brings up the main problem with this film, namely, a lot of it simply doesn't make any sense.  It turns out that the girl has been sold to a human trafficking ring, and Seagal goes through the motions to save her.  As per usual with Seagal nowadays, he obviously refused to actually finish the production, and so we have the usual dubbing problem here.  It is even more salient than usual in this picture, however, for here we have not one, but several different people dubbing Seagal's voice, none of whom even remotely sound a thing like him!  Here the most frequently heard fill-in for Seagal sounds like a knock-off Benecio Del Toro with a much higher-pitched voice.  As you can imagine, the effect is very humorous.    As stated above, the main problem with this movie is that it simply doesn't make sense, which was apparently realized by the director, as he has, in many scenes, the voice fill-in for Seagal narrating an explanation of what the character is thinking! How obnoxious!   Seagal's character likes to teach codes and ciphers to his pen pal, which she later uses to communicate with Seagal.  What makes no sense is that every time she leaves a message for Seagal, the villian, ineptly played by Matt Schultz, sees the girl doing it and yet leaves the message for Seagal to find! In one ridiculous scene the girl arranges some caviar on crackers to make a code.  (Apparently three crackers of one kind followed by three crackers of another kind followed by three crackers of another kind means "This is a trap.")  The villain sees her doing this, and, instead of destroying the message (which would make sense), later has it delivered to Seagal! Huh? In a scene when the girl leaves a message on a mirror telling Seagal where she is, the villian sees her doing it, comments on how clever she is, but then leaves the message!   There are also quite of few mistakes in this film, several of which are laughably obvious.  At the beginning and end of this film, for example, Seagal has long hair which looks like frizzy, black cotton candy being pulled off the back of his head.  During the rest of the film, however, he has short hair.  At the end, after some BS macho dialogue about how Seagal hates taking life but will enjoy killing Schultz slowly, each character uncocks his pistol even though Schultz's pistol does not have an external hammer to uncock, and even though in the very next closeup Seagal's pistol is still cocked! After a sword fight, which ends on a classic move from older chambara films, notice that there is clearly no blood on the floor, and that then, all-of-a-sudden, there is a huge trail of blood between the two characters.    In the finale, the above-mentioned sword fight, the camera cuts between closeups of the two characters to faraway shots that are clearly of someone other than Seagal.  This brings up another frequent complaint of many Seagal fans: his overuse of stunt doubles.  It's almost so bad now that one could say that he doesn't even film his own fight scenes now.  Have you ever noticed that in Lord Steven's early films, when there was a fight scene the camera would pull back and let you see his moves? Now what happens? The camera gets as close as possible, shows some shots of his face grunting, shows some arms playing paddycake, then pulls back showing some fighting while never showing Seagal's face.  Ever wonder why? It's because, surprise, surprise, that's not Seagal doing the fighting.    In the gun fight, which is actually a very decent action scene, watch Seagal as he enters the room.  His character enters the fight by doing a foward aikido roll, which is probably the simplest move in aikido, though it is obvious that it is not Seagal doing the roll.  What is even more irksome is that both at the beginning and the end of the film, which shows Seagal's character "roaming the forest looking for injured animals," or whatever, it is clearly not Seagal that we see walking through the forest.  Was he afraid that he'd trip over a branch and injure himself? Was he afraid he'd be attacked by an injured animal in the woods? I don't know.  What is likely the case is that Seagal again refused to finish the shoot and some scenes had to be constructed after-the-fact, using another actor, in order to make the film work.  I'm really not bashing Seagal, I'm merely complaining because these are persistent types of flaws in his recent films that could VERY easily be fixed.    Be on the lookout for the bizarre scene when Seagal goes to the post office.  The postal worker calls Seagal "Mr. Delacraw," or some such bizarre name, even though his character's name is actually Billy Ray Lancing.  Seagal then proceeds to mumble some French to the man, and then suddenly adopts a cajun accent.  This scene is downright strange.  What is also strange is how Seagal is dressed in this scene--like some kind of New Orleans Anne Rice fan, vampire wannabe in a strange, black fur coat.  I don't know, at least it's good for a laugh.   If Seagal continues in this manner he will quickly find himself unemployable.  The only truly schocking thing is that this hasn't happened yet.  He shows up late to shoots, leaves early, refuses to finish productions, and yet people keep hiring the man.  He repeatedy refuses to do the requisite work for a complete production.  He needs to start finishing his films.  In closing, Out of Reach only has two VERY brief fight scenes, but they are somewhat well done.  Seagal actually takes a few blows in the climatic fight, which is a very nice change and certainly makes his character seem more human.  
 After reading other reviews, I ordered this book. I've worked with SQL Server since version 4.2 and just wanted a resource for new features. I was very disappointed. I found very little of use.   Integration Services is new and I looked forward to the chapter on the topic. There is nothing in the book to explain the design or graphical use of SSIS. Everything is programatic. I followed it through the chapter. It was difficult to follow and to set up. When I got to the end of the chapter, it said data flow (a common use of SSIS) was beyond the scope of the chapter and referred the reader to Books Online.  My experience is that you might as well use Books Online as this book. I own many technical books. This one I sent back 
 My daughter tried the mat once and hasn't asked to play with it again.  Unfortunately, this is probably just another toy that will take up space.  Colored squares on the screen indicate where to step, but the mat does not have the same corresponding colors.  This, just one of many downfalls of this product, makes it very confusing for a 4-5 year old to follow.  Not recommended at all 
 The book is chock full of examples and anecdotes but really has no new worthwhile conceptualizations or insights to make it worth reading.  If you don't know anything about database marketing, then you will get something out of this book.  If you are familiar with the basic concepts of customer database analysis, loyalty programs and relationship marketing, there is nothing new here.  In fact a much better introduction to all those concepts is The Loyalty Effect by Reichenheld or Customer Connections by Wayland and Cole.  The subtitle mentions the dot com world, but the book has little to say about the Internet.  The book really does not cover CRMs (as oppsed to database marketing) in that it fails describe how CRM systems work and what database, modeling and communications platforms are required to implement them 
 should both teach and delight.  The Monk's delights are many, but it teaches not.  therefore, two stars 
 I told myself if someone "fanned their hands in front of themselves" one more time, I would quit. This happened 3 times by page 57. The plot is dumb, I couldn't stay focused; the dialogue is terrible; I don't know that I will ever try another by this author. (Don't think that I am a literary snob, I read nearly everyone: Hillerman, Connelly, Cornwell, Woods, Patterson, Coben, etc.)  I have (begun to) read some bad books in my life, and I have read some good books. I know the difference.... I certainly don't recommend this one. 
 I bought this book because I liked the table of contents.  I assumed this book would present concrete, actionable specifics on the subjects presented in the table of contents.  I was disappointed.  Under information planning, this book only tells you that you should do it.  Gee, thanks.  Under estimating and scheduling - you should estimate future project resources and you should request new resources and fund innovation.  Oh, boy.  Yippee.  This book is an exercise in stating the blatantly obvious.  I expected to see information on the nuts and bolts of producing technical documentation...I expected to see examples of budgets, examples of ways to create efficient systems for document production using single-sourcing, and to see examples of specific, important techniques for planning a document production process that allows for easy translation, revision, re-usability and transfer to different mediums.  I expected to get a reference that would become well-worn on my desk.  This book is as far from such a tome as it could possibly get while still being written in the English language.  I want to improve the efficiency of my documentation projects.  I'd like to know about technologies (XML?, VBA?) that might help me with separating content from layout and improving reusability.  Is that here?  Nope.  But you do get way too much talk about how you should acquire good tools that support your business goals.  There is nothing about what those tools should be or what specifically would make them good.  One page tells you the difference between a "traditional" project and an "agile" project...things like:  An agile project "responds to change" and has "minimal process documentation"  as well as "reduced development schedules".  That's nice.  Who cares?  Implementing a Topic Architecture is the only section that even makes a move in the direction of specific, concrete, useful material.  But even it leaves you thinking, "Well, duh...yathink?"  To sum up, this book tells you all the obvious things you ought to do...but that's it.  It doesn't have anything to say about HOW you would actually do those things.  I doubt the author has the foggiest idea how because I doubt she has a single hard skill to speak of.  She definitely didn't write about any 
   I looked forward to this album as a number of my favorite songs were on it but I was disappointed  that songs like "Hard Times" and "Lady Margaret" were not sung all the way to the end. Both left off about two thirds of the way through the song. I mean if you aren't going to sing the complete song, why bother 
 The design of the book is lovely. The photographs are enticing. The table  of contents suggests a valuable and interesting book. But focus of the  text, the information content, is excessively historical. If you want to  know the spiritual significance attached to certain plants by various  spiritual groups, you might like this. If you wish to create a sacred space  and seek design help, there are better choices 
 Inticing beginning, but quickly drops off into the most DULL details of useless information.  Even the ending was dull and in my opinion, and unfinished 
 Surprisingly sleaze and Chauvinism by female Director Heckerling! She duplicated it in Chevy Chase vehicle National Lampoon's European Vacation too! Many child actors got their start here, but the thing that cracked me up,  as I saw it when it came out (unfortu- nately) was the dialog of my fav band, Cheap Trick: Ticket scalper "...The magntism of Robin Zander and the  charisma of Rick Nielsen...and what about the tunes, 'I Want You To Want Me, The Dream Police...nan-nan-nah, 'You're momma's alright, your daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird, Surrender, surrender...", before he's  interrupted. If that isn't somebody's idea of 'Surrender', they've stumbled  onto this review by mistake 
 I read this book in an earlier edition borrowed from a friend.  I ordered it with the intent of sharing it with people.  When I received my own copy from Amazon, I realized that to lend it out would seriously undermine my credibility.  Here's why: almost every page has a distracting typo, including the back cover.  Although the content of the book is arguably sound, the extensive typos in this printing compromise the message to the extent that the book is virtually useless.  In network marketing, where the all-important goal is to establish the legitimacy of the industry and raise the level of respect for the companies and people involved, a book which creates the opposite effect should be avoided.  
 I paid about $12 + shipping for this at CompUSA. Net $18 or so. It's probably worth about $10 total.  I get about an 8 foot line of sight range. The Griffin FAQ on this mentions two issues: RF interference with 433.92 MHz devices (common in home security systems and some phones) and battery issues. They suggest testing the range away from interference and then swapping battery.  I tested away from interference and got the same results. Then I took it apart (it's not designed to be opened) and found the battery was cemented in.  I called tech support and got a message they were in a meeting. I tried submitting an online message and got a 'server malfunction' error from their server.  I'd recommend this device for use in automobiles and motorbikes. It would also work on a bike, but riding a bike with impaired hearing is illegal in some states (and should probably be illegal everywhere) 
 This book is a collection of trends, theories and quotes from 10 to 25+ years ago. I believe the phrase "cutting edge" is used in the product description - this is clearly the work of an underemployed political speech writer. I decided to take a class - you know, to stay current and the instructor assigned this cluttered mess. Thankfully, I borrowed the book and can return it. The authors cram every possible diagram, chart and spiffy quote they can find into insanely long and disorganized chapters. But they have a secret plan. Throughout the chapters they refer to two assessment tools (conveniently offered on associated web sites) as THE solutions for ensuring successful CRM implementations. These assessment instruments are not in the book. Rather they must be accessed and I think paid for separately. So the cash you paid for the book is merely an advertising fee (someone has to pay for this stuff) and when you have read the last page and close the book you'll know what you don't have - one of those assessments they keep talking about. If you took an organizational behavior course, or a project management course, or occasionally read a trade publication or two, you'll definitely recognize most of the concepts in the book. If you actually finished your degree, you probably won't want either of the assessments. Now, I was given the option of rating this book with between 1 and 5 stars. I had no choice but to give it one star. But if I could give it a dead rat or stinky fish rating, I would choose one of those instead.  Save your money for a harmonica 
 George Kiseleff stars as Gary Ridgway or The Greeennnn Rivverrrr Killeerrrr. Anyways he is married and has a son and goes out to bars, picks up some prostitutes and either brings them back to his place when his wife is gone and makes his son hide in the bathroom when he kills them or somewhere else. Then after he kills his victims he brings the bodies of the women and stashes them alongside the Green River...um, yeah. They also have actually footage of the real Ridgway sprinkled in. Also during this boring piece of crud he narrates the women's names. Gloria, Pamela, Betty, Veronica, Dolly, Molly...whatever. The acting is beyond awful and it's direction is sloppy. The writing is idiotic as well as the dialouge. It seemed like it would never end when I was watching it. I wasnt actually screaming for it to end, I was just annoyed. BLAH!! 
 After a promising start, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's 1944 effort plunges into a sea of MGM mediocrity with a ludicrous plot involving the attempted murder of a boy king. However, Chef Ollie's "Steak a la Oliver" is worth a few laughs 
 Take a step back from your revulsion (a healthy human reaction, so I do hope you were revolted...) to the detailed ritualistic torture of animals and children found in Hard Truth, and analyze the character development and plot development of the last 3 or 4 Anna Pigeon books.  Anna Pigeon as a person is fast becoming a 1-dimensional charicature of the person we met in the first few books; at the same time the author is digging a Natchez Trace of a rut in plot progression - repackaging over again the crazed killer whose insanity is able to drive him through repeated injury to keep after Anna page after page after page. It's as if an editor has said "the stylized nightmare is hot in the industry these days, so rewrite most of the story to be the 'bogeyman' chasing the heroine who just runs and runs and runs."  I can only hope it's an editor saying that, and not a personal problem of the author's.   If one separated the pages of character development from the pages of "insanity-driven bogeyman keeps coming toward Anna" in any recent Nevada Barr book, would there be much more than a short story 
 If you want good old Three 6 dont waste your time with this. Get Mystic Stylez, Then End, and ESPECIALLY CH.2 World Domination, that CD is tha ish 
 My main gripe with this book is that there is not 1 picture.  It makes it really hard to figure out what you are even making 
 this game is just a waste of time everything about this crap game gave me a huge headache think god for advil they said that it took then a long time to make this game and for what its not worth nothing cameras are very bad it makes you dizzy when you play it there also a part in this game were you have to follow a maze in pich dark all you see is the lines from the maze you fall off almost every time plus that baby crying too just does it help you. like I said just a waste of time. plus max payne looks fuuny in this game take a good look at his face it looks like he from resident evil the walking dead. and they said it took then a long time to make this game. this game should have never been release 
 I have been studying this book and plan to begin my slipcover project just as soon as I find my perfect fabric.  This book is of great encouragement to me and I believe I will be successful on even my first attempt at slipcovers.  Sandra R. 
 The dust jacket of this book boasts that it is "the first comprehensive photographic record of the bombings". However, its idea of comprehensiveness - while finding room for a film poster of the 1952 Robert Taylor movie "Above and Beyond" - does not include *a single one* of the tens of thousands of corpses littering the ground of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   That's right. As far as the 500+ photographs in this "objective, informative volume" [quoting the dust jacket again] are concerned, our two atomic bombs - while producing a lot of rubble and five mild burn victims - did not cause a single fatality.   The chief author of this book is identified as "a retired U.S. Air Force officer". Make of this what you like 
 A disappointing book that I picked up for the essays by Parry (liberation theory) and Brennan (a curious "alternative history" of postcolonial studies),  which were OK but not fantastic, and overall the book is dominated by straw-man arguments about postcolonial theory, squarely located within European epistemology. The introduction, ironically, suggests that "there needs to be a productive dialogue between Marxism and postcolonial studies", yet the examples of postcolonial studies mentioned in the book, such as Spivak, have of course given serious and detailed readings of Marx that are not taken particularly seriously here. More to the point, the entire tone is one of "debunking" and not at all exciting. If you're grumpy with all those postcolonial theorists supposedly taking over everything and you want to have arguments with them, or just make yourself feel better about liking your Adorno books more, this might be useful to you. 
 Warner must have fell asleep at the wheel with its DVD reissue of Charlie Chaplin's "Monsieur Verdoux." The "remastered" print is dark, murky and virtually unwatchable. In fact, it's a strain on the eyes! The additional star is given only for the extras -- especially the excellent "Chaplin Today" documentary. This DVD should be taken off the market until Warner gets its act together. 
 On page 40, Diane says to "Slough off dead skin cells with a solution made of sea salt and lemon," but she doesn't offer the proportions for each ingredient.  This kind of problem is present throughout the book.  It's great to read some of the techniques she offers, but it doesn't do a lot of good when she doesn't explain everything we need to know about their application.  It would have been more helpful if the author had included an appendix of "recipes" for the solutions she offers 
 I found this book to be poorly written and disorganized. It also mentions some products in general terms but never tells what the products are 
 I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be 
 The author has an occasional interesting thought about things spiritual, but most readers will get quickly bored with the whole question and answer premis.  I found it laughable that she believes that Jesus came to her so she could paint his picture over a number of months.  Apparently she has never heard of digital cameras. Save yourself the money and just read your Bible 
 This book is so whiny and self-indulgent that I am amazed that Wolf is actually a mother of two kids. It paints an unnecessarily bleak picture of pregnancy and motherhood, which are nowhere near as bad as she makes it out to be. The doctors and nurses and La Leche League and everyone else she complains about in this book are not out to get you, everyone is just trying to do their job the best way they can. 
 Gosh....., where can I start, I buy it combine with Complete Epic Series, I found it no much diffrent.  CES also have this episode.  Amazon should advice the customer clearly pertaining this matter before the customer buy it.  Now I'm facing difficult to sell it back to amazon due to the locality of my country (Malaysia) and its very difficult to find fans of BSG (old version) in my country in order to sold it off.  So should there any BSG fans in my country who read this, I'm willing to sell it around RM30.00 (very good condition)   I can be reach at : 019-756740 
 The 4th in Mercedes Lackey's 'Dragon Jouster' series, Aerie reads less like a fantasy novel and more like an exploration of dysfunctional families/relationships.  I spent most of the book wondering where the author was trying to go with the story and also if she might be purging some anger at a relative or two.  Without giving away too much the book meanders back and forth between the angst of young lovers, the unrealistic demands of family and only at the very last minute is a pat conclusion conjured almost out of thin air.  I would have been satisfied with a three book series (even though 'Sanctuary' was disappointing as well) rather than have the fourth book end it on such a lackluster note.  If you haven't read any of this series then by all means pick up 'Joust' and 'Alta', the first two books.  They are fresh, original and very good reads.  I recommend them highly....just don't go any further 
 Don't buy this book.  Unfortunately I did.  This book is at best an       amateurish attempt at writing.  It is simplistic in plot with little to no character development.  Poe is probably turning over in his grave at the cheap references to his literature to promote blood and gore without complementing his ability to develop and build suspense into his works.  I bought this book based on the rating and review published in the Denver, CO "Rocky Mountain News."   Mystery readers--stay with P.D.James or Dan Brown 
 "The Mind of Bill James: How a Complete Outside Changed Baseball" delivers better on the first part of the title.    The book serves as a narrative biography of James, who is best known for popularizing a term he coined, "Sabrmetrics" or the use of statistics to analyze all facets of baseball decisionmaking, from which minor league pitchers would have solid major league careers to the value of stolen bases.  While it summarizes James's most important ideas, it really doesn't explore how they've impacted the Major Leagues at all, even though James is now a paid consultant to the Red Sox and his ideas clearly play a role.  Gray's sources seem to be limited to James's writings (which are mostly out of date) and interviews with James.  He really doesn't seem to have talked at all with other baseball executives to get their views on James's methods, and therefore its really difficult to know how seriously those truly "in power" take them.  For instance, Billy Beane of the A's is known to use Jamesian methods and done quite well with them (see Michael Lewis's "Moneyball").  Gray doesn't seem to have talked with him or other GMs though.   Another disappointment is the cursory coverage Gray gives some of James's most important ideas, such as the concept of "Win Shares" that allows players to be evaluated over different periods of time, i.e. did Yogi Berra or Jackie Robinson contribute more to their teams' success?  Calling the concept too complicated to really break down, Gray doesn't even get to it until about 2/3 of the way through the book.  One of the reasons for this is a real weakness of the book - its use of a narrative format instead of a topical one.  Because the book takes James from childhood to the presdent and discusses his ideas as he wrote them, there's no sense of hierarchy, i.e., which of them are most important in terms of their contribution to baseball, which is the book's ostensible purpose.  Finally, the book doesn't really take a comprehensive look at the world of baseball analysis to get a sense of how much ground James really broke.  The Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) preceeded James's appearance onto the scene.  To what extent did James popularize work being done already (James can write clearly and make the mundane fascinating) and to what extent did he plow new ground?  Again, while the book acknowledges that there was this universe of research and analysis before James, he doesn't even begin to explore this.  None of this is to criticize James at all, who best exemplifies someone who writes about the game with intelligence and passion.  His ideas are important (whether you agree with him or not), and deserve a better explication than this volume.  In short, a good concept poorly executed in my view 
 Samuel Jackson, Juliette Binoche...I thought it's gonna be a wonderful movie. To my greatest disappointment this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life.  A married mother with three children has an affair with a journalist and yet she's the one to fight for someone rights or to be compassionate about someone. What a non-sense!  Hope the greedy amateurs who created this movie WON some money with this crap movie by LOSING their chance to ever film again! Never ever I will watch a movie with Samuel L. Jackson or Juliette Binoche, again. I'm surprised how did they agree to star in this kind of "movie" that wastes your precious time 
 Allan Bloom, the late translator of Plato's Republic and professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago, has assembled a partially cranky, but never the less insightful critical examination of the American University system in the post-60's era. His assessment predictably reeks of the stuffy conservatism of his mentor Leo Strauss, but that should not deter one from confronting his arguments. The American university, in his perception, is inundated with transitory cultural and political problems; the academy (in Plato's conception), must continually strive towards the good, it must teach what is eternal and beautiful and drop the multi-culturalism and relativism of the postmodern era. Bloom is distraught about the preponderance of German philosophy in the academy, a Nietzschean rejection of morality and a Heideggerian rejection of the impact of the individual. Bloom's knowledge of history and philosophy is fair, and his arguments are not totally grounded in neo-conservatism (he rejects the legitimacy of the MBA), yet at the same time his book often comes across as an old man's rant. He does not value the creativity and individuality of the student intellect, and he may ultimately just be afraid of the black panthers. On the contrary, I suspect that his concerns may be more relevant today as the popularity of the liberal arts degree has lessened, and superficial non-fields such as feminism and multi-culturalism appear to have grounded their place in the academy for good. 
 If you want to read a great book on personal illness by a fine writer, read Reynolds Price' "A Whole New Life."  The prose is authentic and there is not a touch of pretense in it.   Styron's lack of insight into his illness is topped only by his lack of knowledge of abnormal psychology.  His declaration that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance is disturbing, because it mixes cause and effect.  His assertion is tantamount to attributing global warming to melting glaciers.  Mixing cause and effect is not something one would attribte to a writer of his distinction, as it is the essence of clear thought.  Yes, the intensity and distribution of various neuro-chemicals have been found to be compromised among those suffering depression who have been tested.  But how are they compromised?  Contrary to the author's belief that "the madness results from an aberrant biochemical process," and that "such madness is chemically induced," it is the commonly-held view today that psychology plays the decisive causitive role in mental illness, as that psychology is formulated and developed throughout life, and is influenced by situations, including loss, misuse of drugs and alcochol, and unconscious dilemmas, among others.   That an organic etiology has been surmised in many cases of schizophrenia and other psychosis, as well as in profound obsessions, certainly "rules in" brain damage, whether it is evident at birth, or the result of other physical and emotional trauma later in life; but it does not rule out psychology and the higher order mental functions we attribute to consciousness.       
 Boy II Men were extremely hot back in the day and I always wondered why. I tried to give them a chance by getting their "II" album, but I just couldn't get into them. They had a few good songs out, but, other than that, their music was quite lame. Not enough soul and not enough funk. They never got down and dirty. You get tired of the harmonizing because it's done all the time. None of these guys were attractive either. They just weren't, especially the one with the glasses who sang like he had a bunch of snot up his nose.  My friends and I used to look at pictures of the group and they would say, "Yeah, that one's cute, that one's cute, this one is foooiine!" I just couldn't see the attractiveness anywhere. Their looks were mediocre and so was the music. "I'll Make Love To You" and "One Sweet Day" have to be the worse songs ever. I heard both of them on the radio the other day and it made me sick to the stomach. These guys are long gone, but thousands of other sorry guy groups of sprung up to replace them 
 This book contains photographs of some of the women I admire most. Unfortunately, the women are posed holding a large sword as a prop to indicate their fearlessness.   I suppose that this was the feature that "sold" the book idea, but I would much prefer portraits of my heroines without the sword. The sword is a symbol of much more than fearlessness, and detracts from the book. It makes the book corny.  My husband bought it for me for mother's day last year; I'd guess from an amazon recommendation -- but it was a most disappointing gift -- one that I would never leave out for others to view. This wouldn't be true if the swords weren't in every photo 
 Some pages are missed and some pages are the sam 
 I bought this book looking for something that would tell me things I didn't know about Disney (I've been to WDW countless times and love everything Disney).  And while there were things I didn't know presented in the book, they weren't things that I found terribly interesting.  What you get on each page of this book is a brief statement of fact...like #48's "A former test car from Test Track can be seen in the ride's gift shop at the exit" or #89's "Africa is represented by the fictional village of Harambe."  After this you get a paragraph (i.e. not alot) on the statement.  For #89, you're told about the real village in Kenya that Harambe is based on.  There is then a 'furthermore' section which may/may not be related to the info on the page.  For example #89's furthermore section is on technology that can't be displayed and the authors talk about a 'makeshift insulator' which is really a Coca-Cola bottle.  This is supposed to be 'a nod to both the inventiveness of African towns and the longtime sponsorhip of Disney parks by the Coco-cola company.'  If that isn't a stretch I don't know what is.  As another reviewer said, there's little meat to this book and perhaps that's what didn't hold my interest.  The one paragraph of info really did not give alot of info and the furthermore sections were hit or miss about pertaining directly to what was on the page.  I read through the book once and put it away as I don't think it's a good reference 
 I'm about half way through this book and I'm finding it a little boring. I've read so many books about Diana, that I find myself skimming over the stuff that's been written SO MANY times. As a result, I'm probably missing any new stuff that might actually be in here. It's also very hard to find a reading flow--it seems more like an academic text or report, not a biography. Good try at compiling old news into a new book, but I'd recommend waiting for the discount rack or skipping altogether. 
 I was hoping there would be some new info in this book, but there was none. ZIP!!! I still find it interesting that after running a stop sign and killing an innocent driver, that she still has NO comments. None of her friends think it was "a big deal" - that they all just "moved on."  Moved where? In the State of Washington she would be charged with vehicular homicide. It's a serious charge here. I can't help but wonder had it been Hilary Clinton, what the thoughts would be. Lots of reference to her "sorority sisters" - which was annoying. But in a way it helped me to understand exactly where she came from and why she is the way she is today. Don't buy this book 
 It may have been a good book in its day, but is far too dated for a modern reader.  There are many far more up-to-date type books about the war in the Pacific.  The "Diary" is just that and gives too little detail about the actual battles or men who fought them.  He states that there was a "bombing" or "strafing" by the Japs, but he gives no further detail.  If you want an actual, detailed, first-person account of the many battles in the south Pacific, try "With the Old Breed" or "Into the Rising Sun".  Both are excellent accounts of battles in the south Pacific during WWII 
 If there are those out there who have read: "Adobe Photoshop 6.0 Classroom in a Book" ISBN 0-201-71016-1 and disliked it as much as I did, please submit reviews of better books you've found.  I got the impression that, that book tried it's best to make sure you had very little idea of what the lesson was leading up to until the very last sentence. The problem with this method is that it makes understanding and following the lesson much more difficult because you have little idea of what it's leading up to.  Using it as a reference is pretty much impossible. You can't just pick up the book and go to a point of interest and learn that topic. It seems like you have to start at the beginning of the book just to get the sence of something in the middle or end of the book. Frankly, what a piece of crap. Thanks for any recommendations 
 I recently viewed the new chapter concerning 'naturopathic philosophy' [in the 3rd edition, 2005] within this text at the University of Bridgeport's library, as there's a naturopathic school there that I attended.  The chapter discusses the premises of 'the naturopathic.' Do you really want to be treated by a physician who conflates (blends) supernatural, nonscientific, scientifically discarded, idealistic, metaphysical, religious and scientific information -- and presents the whole thing as [supposedly] scientific? [a misrepresentation: Kitzmiller et al. v. Dover Area School District anyone?].  Check out "The Epistemic Conflation of a School of Thought Claiming to be Scientific" and "Why I Dropped Out of Naturopathy School" - online per me, Rob Cullen. [THIS is future healthcare? I disagree, these prophets are truly 'facing backward']. I'm highly ethically disturbed by this text and naturopathy, still. I'll just make one point about this book's contention that complexity, self-regulation, and evolution indicate that life defies the laws of natural science {and is therefore supernatural} -- particularly the second law of thermodynamics, per physics, in terms of life as supposedly being antientropic as indicated by life's evolving complexity [p.081-082] -- therefore justifying, particularly, vitalism and its handmaiden teleology-finalism. [Beliefs essential to 'the naturopathic'; explanations no longer within science at all; rejected-knowledge in terms of the scientific].[Yes, evolution! Even though evolution is actually the culmination of 'methodological naturalism,' which is HOW science approaches phenomena, that is: SCIENCE DOES NOT INVOKE THE SUPERNATURAL {which includes ideas like naturopathy's vitalism, spiritism and kind}, science determines its contents based upon EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE, and exceptionally LEAN explanatory approaches {per parsimony: as in 'do not multiply entities needlessly'; that is, if not ascribed by the evidence, IT ISN'T A SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION}]. Ah, HUGE problem.  The second law deals with closed systems and life's context is within an open system, in terms of thermodynamics. [For the compliance of the 'living' with thermodynamic law, see Atwater & Rosa's work in 1897 which specifically speaks in terms of the first law {the Kinesiology Dept. of Rice University has a nice web page on biological thermodynamics}; and see 'Biological Thermodynamics' ISBN 0521795494 {p.321 specifically speaks in terms of the second law}]. UB says NDs practice "scientific medicine" and naturopathy is "health science."  Hmmm, what kind of [supposed] science text gets something so simple WRONG? Naturopathy is a 'self-labeled science-based' area that won't let go of what has not been considered scientific [the supernatural, the metaphysical, the idealistic, the scientifically-refuted and -discarded -- and kind; i.e., the tenets of their doctrines] for several decades PLUS.  This text reflects naturopathic 'epistemic mislabeling nonsense' [e.g. naturopathy's vitalism ("life force"), spiritism ("personal spiritual development; body, mind, spirit"), teleology-finalism ("intelligent, purposeful") and 'whatever else idealism' AREN'T science-based (or even empirical phenomena, as in therefore 'not scienceable')]. In reality, minimally, a mandatory, manipulatable, spiritual, 'underlying' {metaphysical, supernatural, idealistic and what-not} 'life force' {of many aliases} immediately responsible for states of health and disease is INSTEAD AN ARTICLE OF FAITH {aka 'sectarian medicine'}].  Hmmm: "the most thoroughly researched and carefully referenced text on natural medicine has been revised to include the most up-to-date information...." It has been a couple of months since I read that chapter, and I'm still, honestly, LAUGHING OUT LOUD. Naturopathy is, essentially, a 'supernatural science' (an oxymoron; particularly, vital-force-spirit, spiritism, and teleology-finalism as "science-based" are arrived at through a radical unlimiting of the boundaries of 'the scientific'); while evidence from science doesn't support the supernatural, the metaphysical, or the idealistic; and vitalism and spiritism, in terms of physiological agency, are refuted biological hypotheses.  -rc.  
 It will be easier for a camel to walk through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven. Well Patty Boy I hope you have been training one hell of a camel because otherwise you are going to be mighty hot for an eternity. This man is a intolerant bigot. 
 John Searle is unique among today's Anglo-American philosophers for his understandable and breezy writing style.  He tells you what he is going to tell you; tells you; and then tells you what he told you - almost as though he were briefing the Pentagon.   Construction of Social Reality is a fine example.  Searle is a philosophical realist and has always made a compelling case for our living in a single world, part of it outside of us and part within us, part objective and part subjective, part ontologic and part epistemic.  In this book, in fact, he reviews the various combinations quite neatly.  (Searle, in the early chapters, also includes animals other than humans.  Another positive!)    In trying to convince us that institutions are as real as the brute facts of existence and mind he stumbles.  He is correct on one score; institutions are real.  But Searle builds  virtually his entire argument on the conception of collective intent, or collective intention (or intentionality).  On the one hand, he dismisses a version of the collective conscious, or geist as Hegel supposes.  He makes no argument, other than the concept does not make  common sense - especially for a realist.  On the other hand, he counters the "opposite" position, that each individual expresses collective intent as "I intend because I believe you intend."   That is not the case either, he asserts.  Instead he believes that "we intend" operates linguistically and innately - as an a priori mental function.   Simply because each sentient being is distinct from each other does not necessarily mean that, through language, we cannot express "we intend."   This is pretty much the argument upon which he builds the entire book.    First, Searle does not consider other intentional patterns, such as one individual asserts "I intend" at time t, and another asserts "I [too] intend" at time t+n.  In fact, Searle, in his "we intend" (I hesitate to call it an argument, as his case is too shallow for that) conjecture, does not consider time at all, in particular atomicity - wherein events occur or are perceived "simultaneously" within some acceptable bound.   I personally prefer the "sequential, but appearing simultaneous," approach to the creation of institutional rules and facts, but this is not the place to make an argument.   There are many examples of institutions, great and small, that have been created by a single mind, and then many, more or less, instantly agreed.  Thus, the appearance of "we intend."  One can think of thousands of examples: Freud and psychoanalysis, George Halas and the National Football League, Marx and Communism, to name three.        It is a great loss indeed that Searle undermines his own case, as he is correct in asserting that institutions are real.   In fact, his description of how names, functions, and rules are identified is clear, and his examples of money, baseball, football, and marriage are apt and entertaining.     There are other profound difficulties.  In describing his theory of the "logical construction" of social reality, Searle uses what he refers to as "iteration," with a feeble presentation of symbolic logic.  In fact, what he is describing is the well-worn and well-understood theory of logical types, proposed by Russell and used in the social sciences, notably by Gregory Bateson, to explain the ever-rising tree of abstraction.   Either Searle is unaware of this work, or he must believe that it is inappropriate or simply wrong.  In any case, he never mentions it.   (He also fails to cite references to "the evening star" expression, which resonates as far back as Parmenides and as recently as Karl Pooper - and many other logicians.  He cannot be unaware of this tradition, yet he writes: "there is an expression" [the evening star] ... it has a sense and meaning" as though he were breaking new ground in linguistics and the philosophy of language.)          Another troubling point is this:  Searle believes (again he has no sustainable argument) that processes precede the objects they [eventually] correlate with.   He devotes an entire heading (in Chapter 2) to it: "Systematic Relations and the Primacy of the Act over the Object."   His answer to why there is this primacy is simply "that the `objects' are really designed to serve agentive functions and have little interest for us otherwise... they are just placeholders of activities [his italics]."    This suggestion discards thousands of years of mathematics and its role in philosophy.   If we are to presume that human thinking is most exquisitely captured by our mathematics (thus space vessels we launch into outer space contain mathematical symbols in the hopes that other sentient species might understand us), then we cannot avoid what has been proven: that objects are bound by the operations under which they are closed.   In fact, there are no placeholders.  Processes (to use Searle's word) and objects are intrinsic to one another.  Each inheres within the other.     Despite the leap from static mathematical relations to real world activities and objects, I find this to be a far more convincing explanation.  This, not just because of its pedigree, but because it also raises the issue of bounded time - as I discussed above under collective intent: What is - in fact - atomic and what is not?   Here again Searle does not raise the temporal issue at all. For example, how long are his "placeholder objects" placeholders?  A millisecond?  A thousand years?  Just long enough?   Searle is at his most creative in Chapter 6: "Background Abilities and the Explanation of Social Phenomena."   Here he will not truck with previous work, specifically by "Chomsky or Fodor and not even Freud" on consciousness and the unconscious.  Instead, he proposes "an alternate form of presentation."  Hoping to close in on neurophysiology, he suggests how intentionality is born, speculating upon "states," "functions," and so on, revisiting [uncredited but for his own] work on the will, motivation, learning, and the boundaries between the individual alert mind and the phylogenetic, historical mind.  It is at this point that I more clearly understood Searle's objective.  Put broadly, How can we infer the reality of social institutions and their behavior from the metaphors of mind?  The question, the objective, suddenly struck me as unimportant.   Do Searle's meta-states and pre-intentional background and dispositions and tendencies represent a closed mapping of mental abstraction to brain function and organization?   Is it an accurate mapping?  Can it be verified?   The answer to all is very probably No.  But even if the answer were Yes, the answer is meaningless.  The question is equivalent to looking for the lost wedding ring only under the street lamp of consciousness, which is of course Searle's field.    Given that the ontology of our institutions and societies have evolved into highly artificial, complex hives of isolation, a fruitful line of questioning would seem to run more towards moral inquiry than brain chemistry.    Yes, we live in a world of natural and artificial phenomena.  All are real.  But, it seems to me, the decisive issue is why mankind, which has evolved to attain a far greater degree of free will than any other being on the planet, persists in creating such a plethora of artificiality, to the point that we are undermining the very world we live in?  Why do human beings - perhaps because we know we are living under a death sentence? - try to find solace, not just in groups, but in the fervent pursuit of machines, numbers, religions, money, and acquisitions?    . A final comment or two on the book.  Chapters 7 through 9 are an add-n, as Searle mentions in the Introduction.  As a kind of coda, he replays his view of realism and correspondence theory.   While this message could stand to be reread, it did not need to be rewritten; and it upsets the balance of the book.   Also, given the number of terms Searle introduces in the book, the index is meager and not particularly helpful.       
 I was very disappointed in this book because I felt like the title itself is very misleading. The title of the book is called "FREE MONEY From the Federal Governement for SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS" By  Laurie Blum. The book description clearly states that there are hundreds of  millions of dollars available FREE!  to small business and entrepreneurs,  when in fact the only thing that I found in this book pertaining to small  businesses were LOANS and ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, and the last time I checked  LOANS are not free. This book description needs to be more clear as to what  kinds of grants are available and the title "FREE MONEY" should  not be used when this book is filled with mostly loan options. From reading  the book description I was under the impression that this was a book filled  with nothing but grant information!  I was very disappointed and  unsatisfied with this book. If I'm wrong or misunderstood this book please  fill free to correct me and direct me to the pages where the business  grants are supposed to be located 
     I read a good short story by Franzen in The New Yorker a couple years ago, but this book is lame, lame, lame.  The essays contain little to no humor or insight- they are just lengthy, boring opinions on various subjects.  Imagine if you can a duller, less-relavant Andy Rooney.  If I wanted to read some loser's uninspired musings, I would get on the internet and start reading weblogs.  I hereby declare this book Unreadable 
 The book's objective: "An exploration of core diagrams, and how they can be used effectively in business".  What the book tells you: Fourteen core diagrams, what they are, how to use them. They are all familiar diagrams that an average user will find it easy to understand. Most, if not all, of the diagrams are standard textbook presentations. I see nothing new from this book.  What the book does not tell you: Non-core diagrams. I bought this book expected to discover some fancy diagrams to use in my business presentations. The kinds that consultants are found of using to justify their horrendous fees. But none of that is present in this book.  
 There is only one 100% whole grain bread recipe in this book.  Most of them are less than 50% whole grain.  If you want healthy bread recipes try "Breadtime" by Cheney or "The Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book" by Robertson.  Every recipe in both of those books is 100% whole grain.  I doubt that most people considering a book titled "Whole Grain Breads..." are looking for recipes that contain just a small portion of whole grain ingredients.  With that being said I thought the book had some good recipes and was well written.  Therefore, I am willing to give it 2 stars as opposed to none.  
 As a heavy gym user who has sweated several MP3 (and headphones) into the trash, I thought this was the answer. But after using it for several weeks, I hate the thing. My biggest gripes: 1) The Sonic Stage program seems not to be able to find and import the vast majority of .wma format files that I have never had a problem using on my other players. The program seems like a shill to force you to use Sony's Connect Store. Cheaper MP3 players allow you to drag and drop files direct to the player, I don't want another program just for this device. 2) The entire industrial design of the player depends on one small keyway on the back of the plastic case, which in my case was deformed after one week and would no longer hold the player in one position. Without the keyway, you have a round player that is free to spin in the round holder which make this impossible to use without tying up both hands. 3) Even when the keyway was working, the controls are not easy to use when you are working out. The armband positions the player so that the rear of the twist knob digs into your arm and makes it hard to navigate the controls with one hand while running. It is almost like no one actually tried to use this while running in the design phase. This is a case of a cool looking industrial design that does not serve the market it was meant for, avoid this player! 
 This is a classic example of what liberals resort to ever since becoming unable to win at the ballot box.  
      This book was purchased for me as a gift from my wife. I did not find this book to be even slightly amusing. The subjects that are covered in this book that are supposed to be humorous were in fact insulting to my intelligence. I believe that it is a serious problem if males make fun of their wives/girlfriends when pregnant.       Instead of  using real humor this book uses stereotypes and the notion that all males hate their significant others. This book relies on the typical misogyny that males in our society find amusing. We should be encouraging and supporting our significant others rather than mocking them. From a medical prospective I do not think males should mock or discourage healthy weight gain in pregnant females. Also, I no not agree with mocking, making fun of, or parodying other healthy symptoms of pregantcy. 
      Stellar performances by all actors and actresses involved in this movie are ruined by the sheer ignorance of the topic. Not one single "fact" about guns contained in this movie was true and at the end of the film I had nothing but an overwhelming feeling that the bad guys had clearly won. What a crock 
 Based on this, I had high hopes for the iSee 360i and was perhaps one of the first ones to get this item and try it out.  I may be the ONLY one so far, because as of this date I couldn't find a single other mainstream review.  Now I may know why: it's a complete dud.  I could not get it to work in the slightest with my 60GB video iPOD.  Depending on the iPOD you have, there are adapters that must be ordered seperately, because quite  unbelieveably, they are not included.  To add further insult to injury, the instructions are vague and did not make clear (at least to me) which iPOD should be used with this unit without having to order adapters.  Needelessly to say, I returned it almost immediately. I would defintely say that the iSee is not ready for Prime Time! 
 Can't comment on the content because both the first and second copies I received were not legible. What happened at the printer's? No quality control check, apparently, before these books were shipped for sale 
 First of all, don't buy this book for the recipes.  They seem to be included to give the feel of the period, and aren't very interesting today.  That said, there are some worthwhile passages in this book, notably those that involve the author's bipolar mother. The problem is that the bulk of the memoir is larded with boomer-generation cliches: the motherly housekeeper, the exotic boarding school roommate, the high school 'fast crowd,' the exotic college roommate, the post-college communal household.  One cringe-worthy chapter in the middle is reminiscent of Neal Pollack's "I am friends with a middle-class black person"--minus the satire.  Finally, at the end, things just begin to get interesting as the author visits French vintners in the company of Kermit Lynch.  Perhaps the sequel is a better read.  For a far superior coming-of-age-with-food read, try Nigel Slater's "Toast." It succeeds more effectively on every level--and all he had to work with was British food!    
 This newborn care DVD is strictly for caring for a newborn infant, in other words, what you learn here won't apply after the first 3 or 4 weeks.  My biggest beef with this DVD is that it totally just skims over all the basics, such as how to breastfeed properly, how to bottlefeed properly, how to swaddle properly, how to calm a baby properly, etc.  All the stuff you want to know about looking after a newborn, each is given about 5 seconds of screen time.  Instead, the bulk of the program is wasted on things like "pre-birth preparation," which interestingly appears toward the end of the program, and how the mother should take care of herself.  These are important things to know, but not for a "ultimate baby care DVD."  The DVD packaging is also very misleading.  It says "over an hour of hints"... but that includes 1 minute of copyright warning and another 30 seconds of "you should always consult your doctor" warning, plus a long end-of-program credit.  The actual content is about 55 minutes.  I've seen this DVD and the "ABC of Newborn Baby Care" DVD and even though the latter is not great, it's better because it goes through the important topics step-by-step, and the nurse/midwife demonstrates the techniques clearly.  Between the two DVDs, I definitely recommend the latter.  BTW, you can likely find this at your local library.  It's also available from Netflix.  It's just not worth the price of the DVD, not even 1/10 of the price 
 I had rated this book a "two" in relation to other Koontz books I have read. The book is entertaining enough, but is not very unique in relation to other books that Koontz has written. Koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters. Often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning, but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background. Koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one.   I believe Koontz tries to express certain generalties, some of which have moral and religious undertones:  In the end, good overcomes evil and often evil by its destructive nature, destroys itself.  Love is worth fighting and dieing for.  Love is stronger than evil.  What does not kill you, makes you stronger.  Evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries.  The key to happiness is love, not material gain.   Evil lurks where you least expect it 
 I cannot say if this book is good or not. I have waded through one hundred pages and know that reading ten books a week for twenty-five or thirty years has left me insufficiently prepared for the verbal density. It is up there on the shelf next to William Gass, and I plan to pull it down the next time I feel strong enough 
 Inspired by his uncle, Eddie, who worked at an amusement park, Albom writes a well-coordinated tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife, which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience. The concept is old: a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths. There are concepts to be learned from the five people. The story is delightful and cavalier.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope and South State Street Journal 
 They look great. I just tried them on and they are already coming apart. It's too bad, 'cause they look great 
 1. It didn't teach me anything I hadn't already read in other books or learned on my own.  2. Stressed the importance of medication and ignored the plight of those (like me) who have tried pretty much every med on the market and experienced no relief from symptoms.  3. I was personally offended by the brief discussion of antidepressant side effects which, when mentioning sexual dysfunction, focused solely on MALE sexual dysfunction and completely ignored the fact that most females on antidepressants cease to experience orgasms. Apparently I'm a filthy whore who shouldn't be concerned with my sexual enjoyment 
 Danielle Steel used to be one of my favorite authors. However, Wanderlust was the last book of hers that I really liked. I bought The House hoping maybe she had found her "style" again, but alas it was not to be. I do not understand how a bestselling author can get away with combining points-of-view within one paragraph, "telling" not "showing" the story, and repeating the same things over and over and over until I just want to scream! It seems that perhaps because she is such a big name, her work is not copyread anymore. I think it might be time for her to put away her pen, or get back to the basics of good writing. I will not be buying another of her books anytime soon. I chose to rate this book with one star, because no stars wasn't a choice 
 From the favorable reviews, I assumed that this would be an informative book.  However, this is not the case.  I learned very little in the course of reading the book, and here is why:  The laws are obvious.  Anyone who has ever been part of a team and given even a little thought as to what elements make a team function well will be unsurprised by the list.  The reason that the author says the laws are "indisuptable," is that the laws are so obvious that anyone can see that they seem to generally hold.  Don't waste your time with this book.  Instead, check out "First, Break all the Rules," which is an innovative work that addresses management issues (including teamwork) 
 As many other reviewers have previously stated, P & T are as full of B.S as they do assail it. Its hard to criticize them, because sometimes they're spot on correct, and many of their arguments hold water. Too often, it simply comes down to Penn making fun of people and using forced amounts of profanity to prove that they're wrong. Occasionally, they will use Mythbuster-like tactics, but rarely. For someone who hates Michael Moore, Penn Jilette seemes to adopt many of his methods and "I'm right, they're wrong" ideology.  One episode devoted to Cryptozoology was more of an attack on zoology in general. As a zoology student, I took offense to this. Jilette referred to new species of animals as "stupid" and was basically implying that zoological research is worthless and boring. As a guy who is an avowed athiest and skeptic who trumps science over religion and superstition, Penn only served to remind me, also an athiest and skeptic, how annoying and passionless overly pessimistic and skeptic people are to be around after a while 
    We know from the book's success and from other reviewers that it is good for preparing students who need many easy exercises to drill for a rudimentary exam in geometry. I want to discuss it from the point of view of teaching a student who is interested or could become interested in learning geometry.     In a rigorous presentation of geometry one starts by treating "point", "straight line" (and "plane" in solid geometry) as undefined terms. One states their assumed properties as postulates. One defines all other objects in geometry in terms of these and one derives all other assertions about about geometric objects by logical reasoning alone; one may not use without proof even what is obvious from looking at a figure, e.g., that if two points A, B are inside a triangle then the entire line segment AB is inside.      The teaching of geometry in high school has long been intended as an example of rigorous reasoning but to fully adhere to the above standard would make a course too subtle, long and boring. The challenge for the writer of a school textbook or a curriculum is to present a reasonable amount of geometry, especially geometry needed in applications, and to loosen the standards of rigor by not dwelling much on rigorously proving what is obvious.     How does this book handle the problem? A thin veneer of rigor appears in some places, to be abandoned after a few paragraphs. On pp. 64-65 the book stresses that "point", "line" and "plane" are undefined terms. But it immediately goes on to tell us that if a line segment is divided into parts the length of a line segment is the sum of the lengths of its parts. So, "line" is an undefined term but the book feels free to talk about its segments and their lengths without further explanation.     On pp. 85-86 the book lists 10 postulates of algebra. They are all instances of the fact that in an algebraic expression we may replace any quantity by one that is equal to it. The distributive, associative and commutative laws are not among the postulates but of course the book does not hesitate to use those. After the 10 postulates of algebra come the geometry postulates 11-19. Postulate 14 says that one and only one circle can be drawn with a given point as center and a given radius. Since a circle has been defined on p. 67 as the set of all points at a given distance from the center, it should have been obvious to the authors that there is no need to state this as a postulate. Postulate 15 says that any geometric figure can be moved without changing its size or shape. Needless to say, nowhere was "moving" defined in terms of the undefined concepts point and line.      In sum, there are a few pages in the book where the student is told that geometry is built up by deductive reasoning but they seem to have been inserted as an afterthought and bear no relation to the bulk of the book. With the logic of the book muddled, how are students to know what they can use in a proof? Here "principle"-s come to the rescue. The book contains about 200 "principles".   Examples: principle 6 on p. 146: The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Principle 4 on p. 153: the median of a trapezoid is parallel to its bases and its length is equal to one half the sum of its bases. A few pages later the student is asked to prove some trivialities and if he guesses that of the countless "principles" he has read, the ones he needs to use are among the ones immediately preceding the problem, he will be right.     How far does the book get into geometry? Let A,B,C,D be points on a circle and E be the intersection of AC and BD. Facts about the angles and lengths of this configuration are given much space and, together with Pythagoras' Theorem, represent the limits of the book's scope. As another reviewer noted already, the cover promises solid geometry but the book has none.     Redeeming features of the book are chapter 15, pp. 291-305, which gives the basic ruler and compass constructions and chapter 16, pp. 306-317, which lists and properly proves the theorems of substance in the book. The way I see it, these 27 pages contain the mathematics of the book; the rest is drill.     If your student has or could develop an interest in math, science or technology, the geometry book for him/her is Harold R. Jacobs: Geometry (W.H. Freeman). Math has been my preoccupaton for 60 years but it was still a revelation that geometry could be presented in such a stimulating and attractive manner. There is no straying from or diluting the subject as in other big colorful textbooks. The price is high but worth it. [... 
 Most of Ballard's books are large, well illustrated, and to the point. This one however spends most of the page count on his thoughts about the veterans aboard Ballard's research vessel, the battle itself, and WW2. I wouldn't mind reading about his thoughts in another book as he is usually very insightful but it wasn't what I bought this particular book for.  After Ballard's commentaries and the history sections we see only very little relating to the Yorktown and underwater archeology which is rather disappointing 
 Brian Setzers guitar and vocals coupled with poor production dround out the rest of the musicians. I wonder if there is actually an orchestra backing him up? Save your money. Buy Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, Bill Elliot Swing Orchestra, Cherry Poppin Daddies, Royal Crown Review, Colin James, any album by any of these artists is better than this and you can actually hear the other musicians. I liked the Stray Cats. Somehow his style does not suit this music. Setzer is basically a solo act. I get the feeling that he is not comfortable sharing the stage with other musicians. For me a one man swing band just does not work. I traded this CD for a David Wilcox.  Nice CD, powerful raunchy guitar and vocals and he doesn't call it the David Wilcox Orchestra.        
 right the people i work with love this band and album so really i was pressured into buying this album..so i bought and i thought i was going to be blown away due to the hype from my friends but in reality this sucks more than the mudvayne album i've just reviewed terrible distorted guitars bad production off key singing, half baked lyrics the only good thing is the cover and maybe one of the singles are vaguely average apart from that the rest sucks...don't be fooled by the hype by the press this band sucks so will babyshamble 
 I was forced to read this in 10th grade but could hardly bear reading it.  Initially, I'd had high hopes for it, because we'd read such intelligent, intriguing novels earlier in the year, including "Lord of the Flies" and "Catcher in the Rye."  But what a bore it was! Old Santiago goes out to fish, hoping to catch the "big one" (drawing on the innate male desire to always catch the best, biggest thing.."that must mean I'm macho, a real man!"), blah blah blah, can't catch anything, blah blah blah, and when he finally catches the big one, it is eaten by sharks. The stupidest book ever. I've never been a Hemingway fan, and this book steered me further away from his work.  A pathetic book by a pathetic man 
 Ok, don't get me wrong I'm a major Paul Weller fan, since 1977, but apart from a couple a gems like 'Solid Bond' and 'Shout To The Top' this is Weller at his worst.After the rise and rise of The Jam, he tries to go all soulful and funky and misses by a mile.Don't waste your money on this rubbish, go buy The Jam boxset and listen to Weller at his most powerful and leader of the greatest band EVER 
 I bought this book for my Mom and she tells me she is amazed at the amount of information it contains.  She says it has everything 
 These covers are not even close to being red.  The are wine or burgundy in color 
 Four wealthy millionaire rock stars lacking direction, loaded with drugs with Paul McCartney in charge -- what do you get?  Magical Mystery Tour.  With no plot, great music, this plays as a too-long music video without purpose. OK if you're a Beatles fan this serves as historical footage of the band circa 1967.  But if you weren't a Beatles fan then there is no reason for this.  At least A Hard Days' Night with Richard Lester as director was innovative and can still serve as a learning tool for future filmakers - but this?  Too many drugs and too much ego and no direction.  That's all.  
 I'm pretty sad about this one, especially because of the cost.  I'm 34, with decent skin but some of the typical lines starting around the eyes, forehead, lip line, etc.  My skin does tend toward oily yet sensitive at times, if that context helps any of you out.  A friend of mine all of a sudden looks 10 years younger, beautiful, glowing poreless skin without needing any foundation so I asked her what she was using.  This was one of her key products and she said it took about 2 months for the effect to really be noticeable.    Unfortunately I can't use it enough to find out.  First I tried appplying it around my eyes, on my forehead and above my upper lip.  I broke out in really deep cystic acne in those areas after about 4 days.  I started relegating the application only to the eye area and even that is now having a horrible reaction.  I look like I've got insect bites under my eyes, or like I've been punched out.  Yuck.  It's gotta be some kind of allergic reaction.  It works so beautifully for my friend, I guess I'll be giving it to her to finish 
 Call me a purist but if you're going to learn to speak a language it should be from a native speaker.  Although, the songs are cute they are sung by children with an english accent.  I want my child to hear a native speaker 
 i got this book because i am struggling as a woman to come to terms with male/female hostilities. and what immediately struck me about this book is that the author is going through a protracted, painful adolescence, and while he may be very intelligent he is emotionally immature. he is basically blaming some all-encompassing concept of "WOMAN" for the pain he is feeling about his struggles with his manhood. and other books such as those by lionel tiger also come across as deeply bitter and full of blame. but i think to place blame on women for your lack of strong identity is misdirected. your father was supposed to teach you the basics of being a man. if he failed to do that, then you will struggle for your identity as a man well into middle age. i think it's too easy to blame your demons on goddesses and witches and gypsy women...and i think these men are absolutely terrified to confront thier fathers, but making the hero's journey into the self and confronting your father is exactly what you need to do. i also think blaming feminism for taking the traditional male role away is a sop. men need to be men, regardless of whether their lady works or not. being a man is much more than providing financially. to have courage, integrity, requires true growth, not whining and blaming. this author reveals his immaturity right off the bat when he tells us he cut ties with his wife of seventeen years and three children, because he was in love with a younger woman, and then when the younger woman threw him over for a man her own age, his world fell down--and he proceeded to use yet another woman for sex to numb his pain. immature, and a little pathetic. the women in his life seem to be crutches for his frail ego. no wonder he had problems 
 If you are looking for love, romance, witty banter and everything else that has made Suzanne Brockmann a hit....don't expect it from this book!!  The romance is undeveloped, sparse and stale.  The suspense is based on gore and the end is abrupt.  A great read if you're looking for nightmares.  
 I bought this because I was excited to learn Nippongo, but this really didn't help me at all.  The material is outdated and many people don't even use the phrases that are used here.  I have showed this to many of my Japanese friends and they tell me that I should not try to learn from this material 
 I was forced to read this, and attend multiple seminars from the Blanchard group.  Our CFO lives by the concepts, and he is running our department into the ground by following them.  The book is mostly fluff and took less than an hour to read.  There is ONE good point that I got from it, and that is when setting goals for people they should be trackable, relevant, and attainable.  I got that message in about 5 minutes though.  The rest anyone should already know -- praise in public and reprimand in private.  No kidding, learned that the first time I got humiliated in grade school.  Skip the book, and polish that resume if you are forced to read it 
 Much smaller than it appears. Does not hold 20oz. I gave it away for christmas, instead wishing for one of those old 32oz Aladdin coffee mugs they used to sell or give away at 7-11. I have one old one. It keeps my water cold, and I do not have to fill it often 
 No Spoilers  Where to start. This could easily turn into a long review, but I don't want it to be so I'll try to keep it short. Also, I'll stay away from the religious views regarding this book and focus on the writing because religion is subjective and everyone can (and should) think whatever they want about their religion) Having said that, the one recurring thought I had about this book while reading it (and while thinking about it after completing it for this review) was that it is without a doubt the most esoteric and pedantic book I have ever read.   Now I'm not stupid, and I can appreciate the beauty of words and the importance of diction, but so much of this book was Rushdie writing in such a way to make sure that you had no idea what the hell he was talking about. There are times when you can be extremely metaphorical and lofty and times when you should just be blunt, but for Rushdie, there is no bluntness, and everything must be doused in the most stringy and free-formed words he can think of. Why? In some cases it adds to the story... in this, it doesn't. While there are some very good parts in this book, they are all surrounded by a lot of words that don't really say anything.  Bottom line: you can skip this book. However, those interested in religion and questioning said relgion will probably read it anyway. I would suggest you get a durable copy because you will want to throw it against the wall a few times.  PS: The best part of the whole book for me was towards the end in the scenes between Saladin and his father. If the whole book had been written like that, it would've been a pleasure 
 Keneally writes reasonably well -- not exciting, but serviceable prose. Possibly if you are a committed Catholic and interested in the difference between today's Catholic beliefs and those of fifty years ago, this novel might keep you awake. Otherwise, this novel is exhausting in its exploration of an inexperienced priest's coming-of-age, and the plot is slow-paced--I couldn't make it to the promised murder. Besides, the victim was so uninteresting, I couldn't bring myself to care who might have killed her 
 This movie was a sleeper not in the sense that it was a pleasnt surprise but rather it in fact put me to sleep. I have 3 suggestions  1 Avoid 2 Avoid 3 Pay close attention to suggestions 1& 
 I'm a fan of LaBute's. I loved "In the Company of Men," "Your Friends and Neighbors," and thought "Fat Pig" was pretty darn good. But this latest play seems a retread--and a dull one at that. This interracial love triangle with its unreliable narrator is too clever by half.   I'm not the kind of reader who thinks we must "like" the characters but don't we have to find them interesting, at least? How about a rewrite, Neil. Did a little deeper and stop relying on the "surprise" ending to make it all work. You're becoming the M. Night Shymalan of plays, without the cool special effects 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 Recomendations for setting up a new kitchen good.  The rest is poo 
 Given the build up for this book, I found it very disappointing. It completely ignores the fact that most American companies have failed in China -- precisely following the strategies the author advocated!  If you know very little about China, and have eaten at a Chinese restaurant a couple of times, this book should provide an easy introduction.  Otherwise, pass on it!  I would much rather recommend "New Asian Emperors:  The Overseas Chinese, their Strategies and Competitive Advantages" by George T. Haley et al. for a more complex understanding of business culture in the region 
 Signs that you are about to make a bad purchase.  1 star is the highest rating. I of course didn't read anything. I saw the show on Cartoon Network and immediately ran to Best Buy to purchase every DVD available in the series.  Funny thing is, there was a gap in the display where volume 4 would've been.  I shuffled through the box covers and found a 4th different cover.  Finding no other volumes I took to register took the dvds home, only to find out I had purchased volume 1,2,3,and 5???? watched 1-3 immediatley.  Can't break continuity, must proceed to another store to buy volume  4. Get to store and hmm...Volume 4 Recollections???? Okay maybe they have 1 recap episode, it happens.  Get home look at back of box.  This is the same description on volume 2???  And my soul was consumed as I broke the seal rendering the disc completely unreturnable and discovered the awful truth that THIS WAS A 4 EPISODE RECAP OF THE PREVIOUS 14 EPISODES.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH AAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  OWW OWWW  AAAAAARRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  Release the hounds of hell on the ones responsible for this abomination.  The show is great. If you want to be cheap just buy this disc instead of the first three, though you will lose the soul of the story.  You have been forwarned 
 Bev Harris, Black Box Voting: Ballot Tampering in the Twenty-First Century (Plan Nine Publishing, 2003)  The first thing that needs said about Black Box Voting is that Bev Harris has some things to say that people certainly need to hear. And since the release of this book, things certainly haven't gotten better; electronic voting machines of the type Harris talks about in this book continue to proliferate, and politicians continue to use the system to their own ends. (Anyone shocked by the recent Rolling Stone article about the theft of the 2004 election simply wasn't paying attention; those of us in Ohio were well aware of Ken Blackwell's underhanded tactics throughout 2004.) There's a lot that the average American can learn from this book. However, it has one massive flaw that will keep it from ever being effective: its presentation of those facts.  Technical books, as a rule, should not be written by non-technical people. Harris makes some mistakes that are especially confusing given that she does seem to know, sometimes, what she's talking about; for example, she explicitly defines the term open-source as it relates to software, and the definition is correct, but every other time she uses it in the manuscript, it's misused (open-source software, for those of you who don't know, is software whose source code is generally available, and is usually built and maintained by a community of developers, most, if not all, of whom are unpaid; Harris mostly uses the term to refer to Diebold software that was left on a server accidentally, was never meant to be available to the public, and has never been built or maintained by anyone but Diebold employees and Diebold-maintained consultants). She also mistakenly uses the terms PCMCIA card and memory card interchangeably despite noting in at least one place that a PCMCIA card can also be a modem. I've never seen a modem with its own memory before.  Aside from that, there's the issue of Harris' prose style. Nonfiction writing, be it boring or readable, always maintains at least some minimum standard of professionalism. Harris is quick to throw professionalism to the wind too often here, and as a result comes off sporadically as the schoolyard bully chanting nah-nah-nee-foo-foo at teachers while across the street from the school.   Both of these shortcomings hamstring what would otherwise be a very important, valuable contribution to the world of the political expose. I hope there is eventually a second edition, one that has been attacked by an overzealous editor. That book, if it is ever brought to light, could well change the face of American politics. As it is, it's far too easy to write it off as the ravings of a crank. * 
 Ultimately, the flaw in Lessig's books is his belief that the revolution of personal computing and the internet are the products of intellectuals like himself.  Undermining the freedom and property rights of the programmers and companies who really invented these marvels is a profound threat to one of America's most vital and creative industries 
 Almost unbelievably bad, except I saw the remake of 'Shaft,' which should have been a forewarning.  This is like a comic book for filmgoers.  No, not a graphic novel adapted to the screen.  More like a comic book for kids, that you'd be embarassed to own at any age.  Doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack, a travesty to the nth degree.

 Images of old furniture in tacky layouts with bad curtains pretty much sums it up. And what the heck is with all the cats?! I thought I bought a book on interior design, not cats. Do not waste your time, do not waste your money. Mine will be for sale soon if you need one, you can just buy mine for a buck or two and save your cash for something better. If you really liked the 70's and 80's, you might like this book 
 If you have a mild to moderate gluten intolerance, you can MAYBE follow this book's advice and be safe. If you have full on Celiac Disease, you will find yourself sick in a single digestive cycle!  Jax's information is lacking, out of date, and incorrect. I obsessively research foods, medicines, ingredients, and restraunts so as to be able to join my friends and family in their dinners, and my research shows Jax to be woefully incorrect. I'm encouraging my local booksellers to not carry this any more, and I encourage the discerning readers amoung you to take great care. If you want the feel good stories, read the feel good stores. Don't take the feel bad advice 
 I purchased this book after it was recommended to a friend of mine. While reading it I felt as if I had found the cure for my PMS and heavy/painful periods.  I ran out and got some Natural Progesterone Cream that was recommended in the book, and started using it. Well all I can say is to proceed with caution. After using it for just a short time, I began to have a re-occurance of my depression symptoms.  I have since stopped using the cream and am slowly returning to my normal self.  When I did a net search on the side effects of too much progesterone I found many people with my same experience.  This book is very one sided, and he does not talk much about the negative aspect of using the cream. Please consult with a physician before starting this stuff on your own, or at least be aware of the possible side effects so that you can stop the cream as soon as you see them.  This book has helped many people, I guess. But I'm not one of them 
 I bought this book based on backcover info. What a disappointment. It's not just that it is poorly written and unimaginative. Unless you are into sleazily written sex and gore, you won't find much to hold your interest. There is nothing new here. Just tired, sorry, second rate prose, thinly drawn characters in a porno-lite storyline. Save your money 
  Having just turned 25 and naturally, needing a book to tell me what the hell to do about it, I picked this up. For me, Quarterlife Crisis coasts more on its merits of inherently interesting and familiar subject matter than the contents of the book itself. For all 198 pages it has this anecdotal, unstructured, almost gossipy feel to it where the authors make one point (usually a pretty obvious one), then spend the next 20 pages circumventing the subject instead of really expanding on it or providing a solution. There are pockets of insight here and there, but most of the comfort and usefulness of reading this book ended where it started: knowing that my concerns affected others.  Having been written by women, I have a feeling it will appeal more to female readers. We guys need a stronger dose of logic and insight to be satisfied 
 Only a fool or a competitor would describe Dr. Frank Sulloway's painstaking, meticulous, obsessive-compulsive, decades of careful research in the way that Ms. Harris does.  Perhaps if Ms. Harris had not been asked to leave Harvard and had actually obtained an advanced degree, she might have had the training to understand the difference between what she wants to be true and what is true.  Ms. Harris's license to try to damage the career of a scholar who has spent his whole life in careful contemplation and exhausting research, is despicable and destroys the credibility of her entire enterprise and her book.  Dr. Sulloway, who she viciously attacks, was the first person to retrace Darwin's voyage of the Beagle -- something he did as an undergraduate.  He has received innumerable prestigious awards for his brilliant work, including a MacArthur Genius Award, after receiving his undergraduate and graduate degrees at Harvard with great acclaim and honors, including being named a Harvard Fellow.  Dr. Sulloway is well-known among his colleagues for his total dedication to the accuracy of his work, being almost obsessed with doing the best and most honest work of which he is capable. And, boy is he capable.  Review the body of his work and then make up your own mind.  Ms.Harris well knows that NSF dismissed her friend's claims as ignorant of the scientific process, stating that difference of opinion and interpretation are not evil-doing (as Ms. Harris would have you believe), but rather the very basis of the scientific enterprise.  Without debate about how the world works, there is no science.  Unfortunately, Ms. Harris is not a scientist by training, but rather a self-proclaimed expert, lacking the completion of the education that might have saved her from her ignorance. One can only imagine Ms. Harris is a jealous competitor or a fool, after reading her book 
 If you have a third edition, you should keep using it. I should have kept the $ in my pockey. :(  The newly added Class-D chapter is rather short and trivial. It is just an introduction to Class-D concept. This can be found easily elsewhere. No research, experimental and test results! Disappointed! Has the author listened to current high performance Class-D solutions (like ICEpower, Hypex)?   The other new chapter, DC servo, does contains test/new results. You will learn some useful techniques.   The author should correct some problems (printing, inconsistency between text and figure) that exist in third or earlier editions. However, he didn't. Why?  Lastly, it is still highly recommeded for new readers 
 Alright, first of all, I have read dozens of books on nutrition and weight, etc., many of which were inspiring and very helpful. I highly doubt that many women in 2006 lack general nutrition knowledge, but if they do, it can be found easily online or in the library. Dr. Northrup's advice was ludicrous. 30 grams of carbs per day? I was encouraged when she began by citing Geneen Roth, but things deteriorated from there until I wanted to throw the book out the window. If anyone is looking for a mind-body approach to food, please, PLEASE do not read Dr. Northrup's chapter on "nutrition." Instead, I would recommend Fed Up by Dr. Wendy Oliver-Pyatt, Eating Mindfully by Dr. Susan Albers, any book by Geneen Roth, or even How Much Does Your Soul weigh, by Dr. Dorie McCubbrey. These books adress eating mindfully, allowing yourself to enjoy the foods you love while paying attention to your body's responses. Dr. Northrup's "nutrition" chapter is just another externally driven, trendy, but ultimately ineffective attempt to control weight and promote health (She calls herself a "sugar addict" and if you want information about that, read something like sugar busters (until you figure out that ALL diets will never work long-term). Anyway, I think she's a nut, and I wish that consumers were more perceptive and less desperate and likely to grasp at straws like Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom. 
 We rec'd the Splash dvd and were quite a way into viewing it when it just went digital garbage -- all our other dvd's seem to work alright and we have a laser disk cleaner and try to run it through regularly -- i already threw away the container -- we will run the cleaner thru again and see if it clears up the problem - this is the first time we've bought a dvd that had a problem - we've always been very satisfied with the amazon service -- and products as well.  thanks for asking  pgammon 
 I'm a long time fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries, and have read all the others. Unfortunately, "Hard Truth" does not live up to the quality of Ms. Barr's earlier works. It feels very contrived. It also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups. This book just does not meet the expectations I've come to expect from the series. 
 I was shocked by the level of neediness and desire to blame others expressed by Christiane Northrup in this jumble of a book. At a time when I needed medical advice to decipher the overwhelming physical changes happening to my body; I turned to Christian Northrup as a wise healer who has had the privilege of medical training and a mature woman with the actual experience of menopause. A wonderful combination if Northrup had chosen to focus on menopause. Instead she is all over the map, taking swipes at everyone who has disappointed her in her life. If I wanted to hear my gal pals whine about the mothers, husbands, and daughters I could have shared a meal with any group of women struggling through the ups and downs of life. Instead, I sought the help of a respected physician and got quite a shock, as she rehashes all the real and imagined slights of her life. If you are a middle aged woman who has "stuffed your feelings" all your life, and need help speaking up for your youself; this book may be a big help to you in finding your voice. But if you are a woman who has stood up for herself while you matured, this book will shock you with its pettiness. I am quite New Age and believe in all the woo-woo stuff mentioned in this book; but when I turn to a physician for medical advice on a medical issue; that's what I expect. I can only hope that Northrup will re-read this book as some point in her life and decide to take it out of publication. I was embarrassed for her and returned it. I just don't buy it in more ways then one. 
 The Backstreet Boys are one of the most dated groups of the 1990s.  Lots of pop culture trends from the 90s are incredibly dated in 2006: Full House; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles; hair metal; grunge music; the Macarena dance craze...but out of every trend that ever occured in that decade, nothing, and I mean NOTHING even comes close to being anywhere near as dated as boy bands are.  I recently heard the Backstreet Boys song "Everybody Backstreet's Back" and WHOA!!!  It was like stepping into a time warp!  Every one of these cheesy, manufactured, synthesized sound effects brought me deeper and deeper into the past, until I arrived way back in 1996!  This was an era when genuine musical instruments were virtualy non existant, and computerized synthesizers and drum machines ruled the pop music word.  Sure these corny sound effects were trendy and hip in 1996, but by 21st Century standards they just seem embarrasingly dated.  I can only reccommend this CD for one thing----making it feel like you're a decade back in the past.  I can't think of any other group from the 90s that sounds more dated than these guys.  "Show me the meaning of being dated Is this the decade I need to be stuck in Tell me why I can't be there where you are There's something dated in my heart 
 I loved this when it came out, but I also loved lots of things then that weren't good for me. Not that this is harmful in any way... it's just that it is really, really awful.  Lemmy is the only one in the band that could play with any facility or sense of melody, and even he wasn't exactly at his best then. The drummer is an unsteady, two-lick metronome, and Dave Brock continuously uses a wah pedal on his guitar solos to try to cover up for the fact that he sounds like he's playing with his toes. Overlay it all with undifferentiated sonic sludge, add a flute/reed player who seems to have never learned half the notes on either instrument, and sprinkle with "cosmic" lyrics that weren't so much goofy as stupid - that was Hawkwind.   Don't buy the hype. Hawkwind was always terrible, if terribly sincere. They were a joke then, and if you pay what they're asking for this idiocy, the joke's on you. Want space rock? Buy Gong, or even Planet Gong, not this mud 
 I bought these for my 83 year old mom, she loves jewelry and helped me pick these out. We thought it would be a good deal for the price. She was happy with the look of the stones when they arrived, but as others have noted, these stones are mounted at the end of a rather deep mount (almost 1/4 inch) which makes them rather top heavy. Unless you have very thick and meaty ear lobes, these earrings are going to droop downwards, not sit pretty on your ear as you would expect. Needless to say, my moms ear lobes are very thin, as soon as she put them in her ears, they drooped downward at a 45 degree angle. She was very displeased with these and we sent them back for a refund 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  I've read several selections from Oprah's Book Club and have thoroughly enjoyed the vast majority of them, that's why it confuses me as to why this book should be chosen.  The level of writing borders between two extremes: overdone and shocking, and downright dull.  I generally do not mind subject matter that is lewd and shocking as long as it is coupled with strong, engaging writing, which this book lacks. With very few exceptions I found myself unable to connect with the main characters or the storyline.  I do encourage readers who may be new to the Oprah's book club to keep reading, not all of the selections are this bad 
 I gave this to my 3 year old today and she turned it off herself by the middle of the second cartoon. She was disturbed by the first cartoon that had Donald Duck trying to beat up a baby seal, I have to say it made me a little uncomfortable because we are trying to teach her that hitting is wrong.  But the second cartoon, where the bugs in Mickey's garden grow and try to eat Mickey and Pluto is where my daughter started to cry and ran over to the TV and turned it off.  It might just be my child, because we are usually very careful and watch her videos before she does so she isn't exposed to any overly violent content. But I broke our rule with this one because...hey, it's Mickey Mouse.  Personally, my husband and I had a blast watching it by ourselves. It brought back some great memories. We wish it would have been longer!  But my advice is for the parents to watch it for themselves first before showing to to their young ones. They are the best judge of how much violence is appropriate for their own kids 
 Somebody put something in my drink, or was it this snooze-fest of a film. This guy directs like a dead-beat trying to avoid creditors. What a disgrace to Ram Dass's legacy. Please avoid this film like the plague 
 The thrilling mystery story that we have come to expect from Anne Perry takes a new twist in this book. Perhaps inspired by true events in 1898 Vienna, where three persons died of plague, this is not so much a story of crime but of survival. Unfortunately other qualitites that we have also come to expect from this author, like sound research and verisimilitude, are absent here. There are glaring gaps in logic, occasional sloppy proofing, and, at least as I understand the nature of plague, serious factual mistakes. This is too bad, since the story could have been a fitting installment in the quest of the protagonists for social improvement in mid-19th century London. As it is, the book gave me the impression that perhaps Anne Perry has currently too many irons in the fire and no longer spends enough time on the kind of careful work that characterized her earlier novels 
 I like my blues to be blue.  I want hard times, heartache.   I'm surprised how often Muddy sings happy songs - one's titled "So Glad I'm Living", another one "I Feel So Good."   And then there are all the sexual braggadocio songs, like "My Love Strikes Like Lightning."   But my favorite songs are the dark ones - songs like "Still a Fool," or "You Shook Me,"  a letter to a fantastic lover who's ruining his marriage and lover - and "Black Night, which, fitting its title, is just all around dark.   Muddy Waters had a great band behind him/with him - I read on Wikipedia that they were known as the Headhunters, because they would go to a club where someone else was playing, ask to sit in, then "cut the heads off" the locals with their musicianship.  You hear a tight band, a group of guys that knows how to play together, on songs like "I Feel So Good" and "Bird Nest on the Ground."   But the musician who really stands out is Little Walter, on the harmonica.  That guy can howl, and make you feel it.  He's especially hot on "Sugar Sweet."  
 *Plot/ending analyzed*  After reading so many positive reviews of this film, I went through an extensive search in an attempt to find this rare film, well, suffice it to say, it was a complete waste of time. This boring rarity, should have never seen the light of day, it is a terrible film which attempts to classify itself as a "horror" or "zombie film". It takes one hour for us to even see any zombies in the film and when we do, they are so slow and boring, that we don't even care. The zombies are of the typical variety, very dim-witted and slow and yet at other times they use their own blood to invent other zombies, pick a door open with a key , throw a headstone at a policeman, etc, etc.   The lead actor is played by a moronic hippie who only whines instead of actually killing any of the zombies, if he were as tough with action as he was with words, then this mess would have ended a lot quicker but no one believes that there are any zombies. It's a premise that could have been very interesting if the director could have created a viable story that didn't bore us to death. The washed up, drunk-o actor Arthur Kennedy (from "Lawrence of Arabia" fame- he was the journalist who remarks on Lawrence's annihilation of a Turkish rearguard by saying his memorable line: "Here, let me take your god damned picture!") plays a cop who makes no sense and he goes as far as shooting the lead actor! Call that absurd, it was actually quite a stupid scene.   The ending was typical, and the whole film had no plot what-so-ever, I would suggest to people that they avoid this mess. There's a bit of extras on the DVD, namely the has-been director recalling the "glory days" of the film, and this is even boring.  
 Just a heads up to anyone who enjoys reading Jennifer's books - I've read her Retreat book, The Woman's Comfort Book, and I purchased this one, along with another book titled "The Comfort Queen's Guide to Life: Create All That You Need with Just What You", also by Jennifer, only to find that it's a renamed version of THIS book - "Comfort Secrets for Busy Women: Finding Your Way When your Life Is Overflowing"... it's IDENTICAL.. I find this annoying and misleading. There was NEVER any indication here at Amazon, or in the descriptions for both of these books that they were one and the same. They were published in different years, but I honestly think Jennifer was out to get more bang for her buck on this one.. In addition, as much as love her writing and her suggestions, her character CQ (Comfort Queen) got to be a bit annoying as I read through one of these books. Incidentally, I didn't finish the book. And now I will most likely see if a friend is interested in one of these editions, or I will sell them at the used book store.. Jennifer, this really disappoints me.. Here I thought I was getting 2 different books by a favorite author, only to find they are one and the same book, with different titles.. I will check things out more carefully before I buy another of her books.. to say the least. 
 Sorry but I haven't received yet the book. Could you verify my problem Thanks  Andrea Parmigian 
 I read this book with great interest because research on counsiousness has still a long way to go. After reading books like Dennet, Counciousness Explained and Phantom Limb of Ramachadran I think this book is a little bit of an old fashioned repeat. Even when you keep in mind that above mentioned books are from the same date of publishing. I would recommend this book for younger with litte knowlidge on this subject 
 I have this filter only for about 3 months and it is already leaking on the seams. I crazy glued it and it works while I'm waiting for a new system from Aquafana. Although the water tastes great, it takes about 30 minutes to filter the reservoir. I would not recommeded for anyone 
 This book promotes the theory that certain foods are considered to be "acid forming" or "alkaline forming" in the human body, and that to maintain the desirable alkaline state, you must choose your foods carefully.    Ms Lark's recommendations differ from most acid/alkaline balancing diets, however.  Ms Lark seems to think that acidic foods are "acid forming" (i.e. bad), while in fact many acidic foods are actually "alkaline forming" (i.e. good), meaning they create a desirable alkaline state.    Ms lark suggests taking lemon juice or cider vinegar to correct excessive alkalinity.  According to most charts on acid/alkaline forming foods, lemon juice and cider vinegar, although themselves acidic, are actually alkaline forming in the body.  Thus, Ms. Lark's recommendations leave me believing that she is confused about the very system she is promoting 
 This classic text of the environmental movememt has influenced groups as diverse as The Nature Conservancy, Greenpeace, and Earth First!  Devall and Sessions explore the emotional and spiritual underpinnings of hamanity's  ties to the earth in this deeply philosophical work.  They link a plethora  of sources in their exploration of Deep Ecology, including numerous  religions, the words of such notables as David Brower, Aldo Leopold, and  Edward Abbey, and the perspectives of many cultures.  Despite all of this,  though, I found it somewhat lacking.  Not present is the graceful beauty of  Aldo Leopold, nor the raw passion of John Muir.  Perhaps this book might  grow dog-eared with use in the library of a Philosophy Professor or a  career activist, but I suspect that most people, like me, will find this  book a bit dull.  Call me simpleminded, but I was more deeply moved by  Leopold's heartfelt musings on the chickadee in "A Sand County  Almanac" than by Devall and Sessions' philosophical ruminations 
 I was never a fan of Steve Martini, and, unfortunately or not, I will not be one after having listened to this audio adaptation.  Now, sometimes bad audio versions of book can be due to the ineptness of the reader.  But Joe Mantegnas reading was full of energy and nuance, what there was available.  I believe the problem lies within the source material.  Martini has committed the cardinal sin of courtroom thrillers--hes made them boring 
 This is by far, the worst product you could ever purchase for your very expensive MP3 player.  I had purchased this item after trying out one of the silcone skins that ripped apart after about 3 months of use.  I use my MP3 player when I go running and so I need an armband product that can withstand the elements and my running.    After using this product only 3 times, it began to fall apart as follows:  1.  The protective screen cover is nothing but a flimsly piece of plastic that is glued to the case.  It basically falls apart when you try and squeeze your vision M into the case.  2.  There are these oddly placed velcro dots on the armband that are used to secure it after you wrap it around your arm.  The huge design flaw is that the dots needs to line up on top of one another in order to be secure.  So, if you arm is an odd sign you end up having to make it tighter in order to align the dots.  If you're in the market for a tourniquet, then you should buy this product.  3.  If you sweat at least a drop while you exercise or run (if you don't then you're not really exercising), the velcro dots lose their stick-um.  I discovered that the fuzzy part of the velcro was glued onto the armband.  As it heats up from your body temperature rising, it literally melts and causes the dots to fall off.  It was because of this that my MP3 player almost flew off my arm and onto the cement.    So, if you are looking to shatter your MP3 player, then buy this nifty product.  I think that my son (age 4) could've designed a better arm band holder in his pre-school class.  
 The author clearly has a problem with men.  Most of the book reads like a collection of the author's opinions and rants.  The arguments are circular and redundant.  I stopped a little over halfway through the book because I was weary from reading the same statements over and over.  
 Poor plot, unnecessary ramblings. Potentially interesting drug stories described by a man with a rich vocabulary and nothing else. It didn't keep me interested and I felt like I was dragging my feet everytime I turned a page. I found myself looking for perhaps something deeper and more profound in the book. Instead, I found more stories about mescaline and stupid drug-inpired ramblings 
 This books was way too overhyped.  Upon purchasing it I was greatly dissappointed.  It does give an introductory crash course in some guitar theory, but a lot of its information is half assed.  The way that scales are presented is incomplete with only partial scales and very poor explanations of how the different forms within a scale link together that I would actually consider as being wrong.  A lot of the examples and techniques explained are stupid. Who cares how to play "Louie Louie" in a bunch of different ways, but I suppose that might get you started at finding chords in more than one place on the fretboard.  Nevertheless, this book is boring and incomplete. Buy something else 
 I ordered this thinking it was music from Nickelback and to my dismay found it was only history of the band.  No where in the description of the cd did it say it was only words and no music until I received the cd and it read so on the back.  I sent it back for a credit.  Did not want to add this to my "music" collection.  If I want to know a biography about a band I will read a book or magazine.  
 Gaultry is a young, beautiful, spirited huntress, who has been raised by her great-aunt, a hedge-witch, on the border of Tielmaran.  One day, the outer world cruelly ends her idyllic life, as a squadron of soldiers seeks to abduct her, and she finds herself a key figure in a prophecy that will bless or curse the entire realm.  Ms. Reimann creates, for the most part, a well-imagined world with some fresh touches.  However, the kindest thing I can say about her telling of the story is that, this being her first novel, she shows glimmers of potential.  To identify the major problems: First, the story begins, for the sake of excitement, as Gaultry and the prophecy are about to collide; consequently, the plot is over-burdened with flashbacks and info-dumps about the history of Tielmaran--information that could have been much more gracefully integrated via an earlier starting point.  Second, the magic 'system' involves drawing power from the realm's gods (yet spells are called spells, not prayers), and its workings are never defined well enough to bear the crushing burden of the book's climax, which also spins out of control from Ms. Reimann's inexperienced quill.  (An unfortunate example from p. 374: "There was a weird short-circuited merry-go-round through all the bodies in the circle, an unpleasantly long dance, before the Glamour-spirits were properly settled."  Note that neither circuits nor merry-go-rounds are otherwise known to exist in Tielmaran.)  Finally, several plot-threads are left dangling, presumably for the second and third installments.  Overall, this is worthy of a (cheap) used purchase or a library loan for undemanding fans of escapist fantasy.  (Books like Green Rider by Kristen Britain and The Sword by Deborah Chester came to mind as I read this one.)  However, I would certainly recommend above all of those, if one can tolerate more vivid descriptions of violence and sexual content, A Game of Thrones by George Martin; The Briar King by Greg Keyes; Assassin's Apprentice by Robin Hobb; Rules of Ascension by David Coe; or anything by Guy Gavriel Kay (especially A Song for Arbonne and Tigana).  Two stars 
 Kant is a genius; I give him that.  Still, his primary problem is that he presupposes in all his philosophy that there can be nothing beyond the natural and material world.  His aesthetics suffer as he tries to find a completely "objective" way of interpreting and appreciating the arts.  Not only does this not work in theory, but every human knows empirically that music, sunsets, and Monet are simply not capable of being interpreted completely void of feeling or pleasure 
 What ever you do, don't buy this even if the price drops down to two pennies.  If there was a ZERO to rate this movie I give  it one.  This is a fine sample of false advertisement.  They put the cover of Donnie Yen in a most muscular pose, making the consumer think they're going to see an spectacular Shaolin temple fight.  This movie doesn't even show Kung Fu or any type of martial arts.  This is outrageous!  I was going to ask for a refund but sending the movie back would cost more then  what it's worth.  The story is a rediculous cop story with no Shaolin fighting what so ever.  As a matter fact this is one of Donnie Yen's very first movies,  He looks like a nerd!  real skinny wearing glasses! When was this movie shot? in the early eighties?  Don't expect to see the Donnie Yen in the false advertisement cover of this Movie.  Or the Donnie Yen from "Iron Monkey" or "Fist of Fury" - This movie,"Fist of Fury" is a remake of the late Bruce Lee "Chinese Conection" by Donnie Yen, this movie is the one to own! Get "Fist of Fury" by Donnie Yen.  He is in the best shape of his life.  The action is nonstop from begining to end.  No wire work here, except for some fast forward on some scenes to make him look speedier then Bruce.  Shaolin  vs Devil's Omen, if they offered it free I wouldn't take it! The space on my shelf is worth more. So Halloween movie hunters, BEWARE!  
 A nice book for young readers. Writing style is simple.  No surprises at the end, actually "corny."  I would recommend it for a teenager 
 This is billed as a thriller but there are hardly any thrills.  It would have benefitted from some judicious cutting to make it a little leaner.  The shaky camera work detracts from some decent scenery.  The politics of the film contain no subtlety or shades of gray; I can almost see a couple of college sophomores hitting the bong and sitting down to hash out the script:  Bong-hitting liberal student who has no clue about the real world #1:  ...and then she discovers the evil corporation has been testing... BHLSWHNCATRW #2: (Interrupts)  "Evil Corporation"?  Why are you being redundant?  The only plus for my wife and I was the acting, which was great.  Fiennes was especially good, underplaying his character in the early parts of the film, resulting in a character with depth and nuance.  I only wish the rest of the film was worthy of the performances contained within it 
 I found the little I read of this book predjudice, trashy, and offensive. No dignified female should read this book. It is called a feminist book, but what I have read of it actully disgraces females. Don't waste your time  or money on this book 
 Well, it's not bad.  Like others mentioned, there are a few tracks that are like Bent's previous stuff and they're great but not as fantastic as some of their earlier, amazing singles.  If you love the other 3 "released" cd's like I do, then this one will be the weakest of them.  The first cd had some cheesy songs w/ cheesy "guy" singing but it kinda worked for me and had great beats and slide guitars & stuff in the music to make up for it.  And they were just plain fun tracks inbetween absolutely amazing ones.  Half this cd, which is under 50 mins., is pretty darn good and the other half is kinda crap.  Where Ariels and the other cd's have me coming back for more listens, I find myself not really caring about this cd as much.  I still have faith in them though- they'll come back with a better cd. -- I hope. 
 Overly flowery and melodramatic language predominate in this novel about a dysfunctional family in South Carolina, yet the subject itself, physical and emotional abuse within the family, is poorly explored.  The characters are one-dimensional and inconsistent.  The plot is not very well developed with a number of gaping holes the reader is expected to believe will be understood later, a later that doesn't somehow come, while some preposterous situations are given many pages of romanticized nonsense to fill in the gaps.  I can't imagine where all the good reviews come from because I found this to be a boring and pointless read.  The dreadful ending just caps it all off.  A real waste of time 
 Thomas Sowell continues his simpleminded interpretations. His so-called refutations have not changed. He is a clown. He learned obviously at an early age how to make money by proclaiming he is not Black.And he is right! He is not! 
 They have no label on the top (hard tell which side is up). These are the worst DVDRs i have ever seen and used. The Speed is much slower than other brand DVDR such as Ridata.( although they are both 4X). 3 of 4 DVDRs got errors during burning. But Other brand DVDRs are 100% OK.  I am going to return these package to Amazon.  
 Perhaps I'm not a true junglist, but I do not find anything really innovative or amazing about Touching Down. In reflection to Size & Reprazent's first release, New Forms, which at the time destroyed and rebuilt the whole meaning of DnB, I would say Touching Down is your average DnB album. Club favorites maybe, however Size's latest solo work leaves a lot to be desired on the creative side of things 
 the offspring..a band who draws inspiration from some of the best music around(the damned, TSOL, agent orange, adolescents, and DI), have great record label that is responsible for new records/re-issues from TSOL, The Damned, and other great legendary punk artists, and a band who used to be really great punk revival have truly disappointed me with records like this.  i fell in love with the offspring when i bought smash..after that, i proceeded to collect ignition and ixnay.and still, i loved them..but i was iffy on this..i mean i knew of songs like pretty fly and why dont you get a job and how bad they were, but songs like kids arent alright made me a buyer...i must say, i was rather impressed with this and decided that i underrated it...that was 3 years ago.  now, i think this album is just okay..i mean its good enough to be able to warrant a stay on my windows media player on my laptop, but as for keeping the disc, it isnt.  i say get this..get it cheap..rip it to your comp and then sell off. it gets old fast 
 I purchased Dr. Street's book out of curiousity of what the author would write to defend the evangelical method of altar calls and the ever so popular sinner's prayer.  Sadly, the book lacks any serious theological treatment of salvation and completely ignores the sovereignty of God in salvation.  The book seeks to be a guide both to evangelists and pastors to how to deliever an "effective" invitation (emphasis on numbers being the key word for effective.)  Dr. Street should have rightly named this book, "The Effective Manipulation Methods" and then traced the poor theology of Charles Finney right down to Billy Graham.  While Dr. Street does try to answer his critics (such as Martin Llyod-Jones) he never truly gives any answers but simply lists Llyod-Jones' nine reasons not to give an altar call and never gives any biblical reason we should do so.  Dr. Street works from a Baptist theology that ignores election and the work of the Holy Spirit (John 6:44; Acts 14:48) and places the emphasis on man (both pastors and hearers).  He cites not one biblical example of an actual altar call or genuine invitation but uses various Scriptures out of context to try to make his point.  He also gives justification to the sinner's prayer method although he never deals with any Scriptures concerning this matter (since there are none I would expect him to do so).    Overall, unless you are an Arminian in your evangelistic approach, then I would not encourage you to purchase this book.  It offers nothing in the means of theological content.  You would be better to read Iain Murray's book THE INVITATION SYSTEM or John MacArthur's ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL, THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JESUS, or HARD TO BELIEVE.  
 I got this book not too long ago based on some of the reviews here.  Like everyone else I want to get to the bottom of the terrorist attacks on 9/11.  I thought maybe this book would have the answer.  Well going through it the book does make a lot of sense.  I can understand the attraction of the oil money and the involvement of politicians and other powerful figures.   But it kind of falls down when you look at the truth behind it.  Some of the people in the book have taken the authors to court over what it says.  And as far as I can tell the result was that the authors were wrong.  Now I know it would be kind of hard to show that someone or other paid for the Twin Towers attacks and so on but you would think there would be enough to get it to hold up in court.  But I am wrong about that!  So this book is kind of the twin to Fahrenheit 911.  A lot of interesting stuff but you don't know if it is true or not.  I tried looking at Brisard's company site and it seems to be shut down.  I saw a web page that said one of the court decisions against him also included shutting down the company.  Now what I find really sad about this is that Brisard was helping the families of the 911 victims sue the terrorists.  The US cannot even catch Ben Laden so it made sense to me that you could sue the Saudis and so on to get some justice.  But I for one have to wonder if the court actions against Brisard are going to make it just a little harder for the families to get their fair day in court.  All in all the book is worth reading as it is pretty interesting even today but you just have to wonder how much is really true 
 There's not an ounce of meat in this book.  This book features a steady stream of the author's self-praise and excessive "name-dropping".  The "conclusions" are certainly not original.  The thesis of the book is never really developed and the text is directionless and slow. 
 suggested by Amazon after selecting the correct size - cheaper so purchased - had to return it since it didn't fit.  
 For the price you cant beat this product, IF the problem I'm experiencing can be solved.  I bought two of these brushes, one for my home bathroom and one for my work-out bag. Love the price and timer feature...  But it seems that once I've used up the power in the brush, it wont recharge properly. I'm experiencing this problem with both brushes no matter how long I leave it in the charger. If there is a simple fix for this then I'd say 5 stars. If not, then 2 Stars is well earned, seeing as how I've been on their support line waiting (as I type this) for over an hour 
 Must we indulge yet another collection of tripe in the guise of self-help? Didn't we get this sort of nonsense out of our systems a long time ago?   If you are the type who hangs around in the self-help section of Borders looking for something you haven't yet read, hoping the nice-looking man ordering the latte isn't as bad as your ex-husband, well, sure, pick this up. You can read it a few hours later after you've snuck that man past your sleeping children's doors and out to his car, and feel good about yourself and how wonderful a person you are for reading something like this.  For the rest of us that live with a real sense of morality, well, we know books like this are just excuses - a mechanism by which the anointed democrat leftists sanctify themselves. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure why I wrote this review. If it offended you, you're beyond help. If it rang true, you already know you don't want to get anywhere near this book 
 On page after page of this book, Western Imperialism shines through. It's over, Mr. Bell. The Empire is no more! I could not bring myself to finish this book. I was that offended by the apparent xenophobia and the preposterous plot 
 Borg is new and he is trendy...as Dr. Gardner alludes to in another review here, his interpretation of the Bible etc. almost totally disregards some of the core fundamentals of the Christian faith. It is yet another example of a flash in the pan perversion of Christianity...to claim that Jesus is not God flies against a most central belief...perhaps worth knowing about, but beware...  It continually amazes me how we are all so subject to becoming blind to the deeper truths of the Bible...for anyone interested in a relatively thorough critique of Borg, go to www.equip.org and do a search for Borg. You will find a review of his work which I highly recommend that you read before you buy any of Borgs books.    I bought three of his books via Amazon on the advice of a good friend...anyone interested in getting three of his works real cheap?  By the way, I wish that Amazon would provide a rating of "0' for things that are totally worthless...I struggle to give this book even one star 
 I watched about fifeteen minutes before I got enough.  It was so un-Biblical it was insulting.  Besides that, it's a bore 
 ...before putting this horrid book out of my mind once and for all.  I had originally spotted the book on a list of some guy's "best science fiction" on the internet. So I thought Crash was going to be a sci-fi novel. How is it science fiction? It was written in 1973 and seems to take place in 1973, and even includes Elizabeth Taylor. There is no normal element of science fiction such as new technology or fanciful science. Just some perverts lobbing semen around car wrecks. Fiction yes, but science fiction? I don't get it.  The book truly fails on all levels. It's not art, it's not prose, it's not even provocative themes... it's just plain junk. The writing itself is amateurish. As other reviewers have noted, he uses the same words and phrases over and over again. How this book ever achieved a small degree of fame is beyond me. Perhaps it came out at a time when it was "uncool" to criticize sexual content because it would mean you're "unhip" so a couple of critics or authors pretended they liked the work as an exercise in proving they are experimental.  Is JG Ballard still alive? I almost suspect some of the positive reviews on this site must have been written by him.  Some have explained the book as a "commentary on technology" as it impacts our lives. Poppycock. What's the commentary, car wrecks are bad?  Don't be fooled into thinking that people's negative reactions to this book mean that it is "redeemingly shocking" in some way and normal readers just can't "handle it."  It really is crap 
 In Hollywood films, kids are mean. They tell their siblings to drop-dead, roll their eyes at dumb-old-dad, barf all over the floor and run away, and always seem to have a snarky come-back for every situation. They are cynical, jaded, suspicious, and  totally lacking in innocence; they represent the worst aspects of adulthood.  In my opinion, films like this are like extended sit-coms - although most sit-coms are better written. My family was quite stunned by how nasty everyone was; there wasn't a kind moment anywhere except in the last 5 minutes, when syrupy-violins prompt us to recall how much they really "love eachother". If you want to see a film where kids act and talk like real kids, try to get your hands on a British film called "Melody", made in the early 1970's. It'll knock your socks off. 
 I received this popper as a gift, and while it looks nice, it only pops of 30 percent of the kernels the rest just sit in the bottom of the machine. I have tried numerous times letting the device warm up for several minutes and also tried different types of popcorn. Nothing worked. If I had the receipt it would already have been returned. Since I don't, it is going in the garbage. Also for some reasons hot unpopped kernels will fly out of the machine. Stay away from this machine 
 This is NOT a travel guide! I didn't find this book very informative but rather annoyed by the author's political comments. The entire book is politically loaded, with comments against Chinese government on almost every page of the book. Yes, I know that Tibet is a politically sensitive region and a good travel book shouldn't avoid the topic.  However, the authors goes too far to turn this travel book into a personal political statement. In addition, as a Chinese reader, I found many details described in the book highly selective and biased. The author was trying to demonized Chinese - not only the Chinese government but also the average Chinese people! I bet you'll never dare to go to Tibet after reading this "travel guide" because the place was described like a communist hell! 
 I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed by a "celebrity event."  I used to say, "Heck, I'd watch William Shatner read the phone book," and now I'm sure that would have been a better use of time (his AND mine.)  Full five stars to Leonard Nimoy for not participating in this crude, cruel, and contemptible exercise.  There were a couple of very funny moments, as when one of the pack of "comedians" did a spoof on having to have a speech coach ...  for years  ...   and years ...  to correct ,,, his tendency  ... to speak as Shatner did and still probably does in Boston Legal.  My advice:  go watch old Star Trek, old TJ Hooker, new Boston Legal -- anything but this nasty bit of trash. Can only hope he got paid well for participating. 
 I found a copy of this book at a used book store. I was able to buy it for $3.00. After hearing all the hype, I read it and here are my feelings.  Contrary to the the press promoting the Sandler System, it really is nothing new. Reversing is really just a ripoff of Tom Hopkins "porcupine" technique. A technique Hopkins learned from his mentor, the late, great J. Douglas Edwards who was teaching this 50 years ago!  Strip lining is just another name for "the takeaway" popularized I believe by ELMER LETTERMAN back around 40-50 years ago.  This book is full of manipulation techniques which the prospect will catch on to very quickly. Finally, the one and only company that I knew and was associated with for a short time t hat used "The Sandler System" had horrible results and probably the highest turnover of any sales company that I have ever  been associated with.  The biggest proponent in that company said that "Sandler is the future of selling. I don't need these other trainers." Later I found that his highest weekly check was for $480 for the week (or is that weak??) And he was one of the top reps in that company.   Other things about The Sandler System; Role and Identity. I agree with this but this too is nothing knew. Mazwell Maltz was teaching this over 40 years ago. Brian Tracy hammers this in his trainings as well and has been for at least 25 years. Other personal development trainers do this as well.   Chapter 7: Can Asking Questions Be The Answer is probably the best chapter in the book and again is nothing new. Tom Hopkins and Brian Tracy both hammer this in their trainings. J. Douglas Edwards hammered it over 50 years ago. The master of this was the late Ben Feldman. Fred Herman was also a proponent of asking questions and even sold Mike Douglas an ash tray on The Mike Douglas show in front of a national audience.   I think that this book makes for a decent read, if you can find it at a used book store and not pay too much. My main complaint is that the proponents of this program make it out to be the be all and end all of selling and say it is "NEW" And like "Spin Selling", it represents only part of the selling process, not all of it. And The Presidents Club is just a culmination of the best of the best of sales and motivation trainers, past and present. I recommend the live seminars and trainings, somewhat, but the tapes that are  being sold on the internet are inflated by at least 500%.   And as I stated in my headline, if this program is so great, then why is this book out of print? Hmmmmmm????  There are better sales books and trainers out there.      
 Horrible - the first time I slid my nano into the case it put several scratches on the front; defeats the purpose for even buying it. I would recommend getting an Agent 18 case. 
  I thought that I would love this book because I am interested in JFK.  	 What I found was a lousy book that spent much of it detailing Kennedy's political career and leaves out or does not go into much detail about significant events that happened to him while in Political Office. Also much of the info can be found in numerous other books about JFK or the Kennedy Family with little new information.  I was also disappointed about his discussion about the assassination. After all this time and all the information out there the author still thinks that Oswald killed JFK.  If you are interested in JFK, this might not be the book for you 
 This is simply a disjointed journal of a series of short hikes with portions deteriorating to a lame account of car camping. This ranks as one of the worst books ever published. Don't waste your time 
 It's great that people are starting to look at this topic, but this book reeks of a quick-hit, let's-publish-a-book-after-a-seminar job. The title itself says it all: the Great Leap Forward was a Maoist economic project in the late 50s that left up to 30 million people dead. How can one use this term, which refers to one of the great human tragedies of the 20th century, as a cute title for a book? The GLF wasn't cute. It has nothing to do with architecture or urban planning. Using it in this cavalier way belies a complete ignorance of the past 50 years of Chinese history. Sorry if this seems like nitpicking, but I can't take a book seriously that doesn't take its topic seriously 
 i couldn't help but notice all the dismay displayed in the reviews below about 'an angle' ripping off conor oberst (bright eyes). i'd just like to point out that conor originally ripped off a lesser known, less poster boy type, called DAVID DONDERO. he is an extraordinary & original talent who conor was (and probably still is) a big fan of. without conor's indie boy looks & style, david holds less potential for mass marketing, which is why he hasn't had conor's success.  you should check him out, and  remember he was doing his thing way before conor bounced on to the scene & was given credit for his originality & genius 
 This book is primarily, in my view, a male bashing book, with some admittedly interesting side comments about the clitoris. As a male human I am intrigued by the clitoris & would love to learn more about it. However the author of this book sems to, in my view, hate men & maleness so much, that she wants to keep men from reading her book & enjoying it via inappropriate overgeneralizations & male bashing. Can human females in western culture only enjoy their sexuality at the expense of all human men? I hope not 
 This book was not in the same league of Frazier's first effort.  I found myself not caring about the characters and basically wanting the book to end.  The lack of a plot would be fine if you could get caught up in the character or lost in the beauty of the language but the writing is so overblown and tedious the fact that nothing much is happening stands out.  I really wanted to like this book and I was trying hard to like it as I read it but the fact of the matter is, this is a bad book 
 I can't believe what a useless waste of space this "vacuum cleaner" is. I've had it less than a year. On the 2nd use, the first belt broke. It goes through belts like my 3 year old goes through clothes. The hose won't consistently stay clamped to the handle, falling into your knees as you try to push the thing. I can't get through a single job without it clogging and respreading the dirt everywhere as I try to unclog it. Its a 3-4 step process if it clogs further inside the filter sending me into a full-blown asthma attack (and my asthma is pretty mild). Its going to the curb on the next trash pick-up because now the clamp that holds it locked upright is now broken and I don't even know how that managed to happen. I guess at about $90 you get what you pay for. Those Dyson's better be worth the $[...] because I'm getting one tomorrow 
 The Crossing is set in New Mexico and Mexico in the late 1930s, during the last days of the Wild West before the onslaught of the motor car ends the frontier once and for all.  	The story is centred on two adolescent, monsyllabilic farmer's sons in New Mexico. When a wolf comes up from Mexico the farmer and his two sons decide to set traps and catch the wolf. McCarthy takes us into the mind of the wolf and an interesting, but sadly short, period of the book ends when the older son, alone, catches the wolf. Here he decides, rather than kill it, to return it to Mexico from where it came. When he reaches Mexico he is surprised to find the Mexicans don't see his generosity in quite the same light. After they commandeer the wolf and set it to fighting dogs Billy shoots it, and drifts through Mexico before returning home where he finds his parents murdered by horse thieves. An obvious plot at this stage would be for them to seek revenge but no. Instead they become thieves themselves and we find ourselves heading back to Mexico, with an unclear goal except to find their horses, a big country in which to find half a dozen horses, and our two protagonists becoming less and less likeable by the page. It is a pity that although McCarthy manages to take us into the mind of the wolf he never once reveals what the two boys are thinking, nor why. What motivates Billy and Boyd? For the entire book we never find out.  	 They meet a girl in an encounter that will be confusing to anyone who does not speak fluent Spanish. They also meet several Mexicans, some with their parent's horses, and they reacquire some of the horses in equally confusing scenes. Later Boyd, the younger brother, runs off with the girl; Billy returns to the USA, tries and fails to join the army (we are now in the 1940s) and so works on various ranches before returning to Mexico, for the third time, to find his brother.  	In `The Crossing' there are in fact three `crossings' into Mexico, which is projected as a lawless country full of generally unpleasant people, much like the USA. In fact, through the book there are few endearing, likeable characters that the reader can actually root for; the wolf and one or two horses are the possible exceptions. Much of the dialogue is in Spanish and difficult to follow. McCarthy may be pleased with himself for speaking Spanish but many readers of English literature do not and with so much dialogue in Spanish, and untranslated, it makes the story difficult to follow. 	This is further aggravated by a lack of proper punctuation. Mr McCarthy should remember that punctuation is something that has evolved with the English language and is there to make the language more comprehensible. To eliminate this not only distracts readers from what you are saying, but stops readers from enjoying the writing. Reading a sentence of 80 words without so much as a comma is very hard work. Lawyers often omit punctuation when writing a legal document to protect them legally. At times, `The Crossing' was much like reading a legal document, you need to read each sentence twice to understand exactly what McCarthy is saying.  Yet McCarthy still gives a compelling story described in vivid locations. Behind the faade of Spanish dialogue, unpunctuated English and dull characters there is a powerful storyteller at work here. It is a pity he chooses two charisma free lads having a loosely connected series of mini-adventures to express himself 
 This book was assigned in a graduate level international relations class.  While the aim of the book is laudable - to give practical solutions to foreign policy problems - the execution leaves much to be desired.  The editors make each contributing author shoehorn their essays into a rather clumsy outline.  There are countless "no **** Sherlock" moments when reading this book.  Overall, it is not insightful and an utter waste of time. 
 I can overlook poor plotting if the characters are three dimensional or I am made to care about them in some way; I can overlook poorly drawn characters if the plot is really well done.  But what I cannot abide is if a book does neither of these things well at all.  And where were the editors on this one?  There were so many run-on sentences I wanted to scream.  I cannot believe that this woman's books are so popular.  I read a lot of books--and this was the worst example of cheap writing I have ever seen.  Don't waste your money!  If I'd been able to leave a rating of less than one star, I would have 
 Once I saw the numerous reviews coating the inside and outside of this book telling me how much I was going to like it, I was already dubious.  Perhaps I like to be contrary, and that may be why I was irritated by this book.  I understand that this is his way of dealing with the passing of his parents and the growing up he was "forced" to do, but his style of writing came off as abrasive, narcissistic, and smug.  This is a memoirs of sorts, so it's hard for me to criticize his need to put this out, but if I was supposed to gain anything from it, I didn't.   I didn't find his wordplay sparkling, I don't find him droll or charming, and I felt like he was trying too hard for me to do so.  Plus he yammered on so much it was hard to understand the message(s) he was trying to convey to the reader, if any.    
 I can see the excitement, people get out of a gorefest but this is too much.  All taboos have been broken there is nothing left.  Johnny Cash should come back and torment the makers of this film for misusing one of Cash's songs. He would never have approved of this film. Letting a newborn baby be come a zombie is beyond bad taste. Johnny's horsemen should trample the makers of this film into grimy puddles of gore 
 Maureen O'Flynn is a perfectly good singer, but whoever thought this "marriage" of opera and pop was a good idea is the same guy that thinks John Tesh is a great composer.  People have simply stopped listening seriously to music, and it is a real shame.  This recording is for the scrap heap.  The accompaniment is cheesier than a big wedge of provolone.  There isn't a single live musician in the studio with this young lady.  The people who think this is good music are the same ones that aren't bothered by the prospect of a canned sound track in a Broadway show or the "pop stylings" of Charlotte Church.  Go out and find some REAL MUSIC, people!  It's there if you look.  As the great American composer Charles Ives wrote: "Open your ears!&quot 
 Using this book and CD-ROM depends upon being able to download the customized settings, so that the reader's PhotoShop, for example, behaves the same way as the author's PhotoShop. However, my system repeatedly hung up on that section of the download from the CD-ROM. Furthermore, this author doesn't start at a "dummies" level by defining the terms that he uses throughout the lessons, so I had trouble following along. Overall, this wasn't much help for me in my quest to learn PhotoShop from a baseline of complete ignorance 
 Although not nearly as heinous as Richard Avedon's "In the American West", Stephen Shore's "Uncommon Places" earns an honored place in the annals of overrated art. Its sole interest is its time-capsule appeal.  Imagine if you will, taking a camera across America and shooting ugly buildings, roads, humble homes, and desolate scenery with nary a concern of cohesiveness or narrative. Make no attempt to include a theme, other than perhaps a New Yorker's condescension much like the lyrics in the Talking Heads song "The Big Country." You then have this book.   Perhaps 15-20 of these photgraphs hold some genuine magic. The rest are totally ridiculous. Much better is Eggleston's "Los Alamos."   Even the title is grating 
 Stalin despite the flattering summary above was not a great Marxist thinker. Stalin not only missed the basic ideology of Marxism but is also a very poor writer, who's works at best are boring, inacurate and documents of lies. If you want to read a great Marxist writer I would suggest Lenin or Trotsky. Put these works where they belong, in the fire along with Mein Kampf and anything in favour of George Bush 
 1. It didn't teach me anything I hadn't already read in other books or learned on my own.  2. Stressed the importance of medication and ignored the plight of those (like me) who have tried pretty much every med on the market and experienced no relief from symptoms.  3. I was personally offended by the brief discussion of antidepressant side effects which, when mentioning sexual dysfunction, focused solely on MALE sexual dysfunction and completely ignored the fact that most females on antidepressants cease to experience orgasms. Apparently I'm a filthy whore who shouldn't be concerned with my sexual enjoyment 
 i really liked the first one and even went to my mom's house to pick up the second one (this) at 10:30 at night right after i had finished it because i was so pumped to read on. from the get go i could not get into this book and i had to force myself to get to page 120. not much has happened to make me want to finish it. very boring. not really into roz and mitch characters, i don't think they are very well developed, they seem kind of blah. and the story is kind of blah. blah, blah, blah, and just words for the blah, blah, blah going on and on.  
 It didn't even last 24 hours before it split at the seams in several different spots.  Don't waste your money 
 This book purports to examine the TV series Buffy and Angel with respect to the characters relationships as "families."  I thought that sounded like a great idea, so I read this book.  Unfortunately, the essays in this work are quite muddled.  The author begins each essay by stating what he will be focusing on for the duration of the essay, but then he inevitably meanders away from the topic.  Maybe he should consider creating an outline before he starts writing and sticking to it!  Another problem I had with the essays in this book is the fact that the information about the shows that is presented within them is often incorrect.  I found that incredibly distracting and annoying.  I am giving this book the two stars for the idea --- it gets no stars for the execution of the idea 
 This bit of capitolism bashing is not a bad novel, but if "1984" is worth five stars (and we all know it is) then this amusing, if somewhat forgetable, narrative can not be given half its status.  Anyone who gave this book three or more stars should certainly re-evalute their opinion with the above paragraph in mind. Though, perhaps I have under-rated the book based on lofty expectations provoked by his latter work.  Anyone who may have given this book five stars:  Do you honestly think this first novel is the equal of a titan of literature like "1984"?  It simply doesn't deserve the same status. 
 Will not run on my computer... love the content however I keep my music on my hard drive and was looking forward to working out with this album on my MP3.  I will be demanding a refund!  DO NOT BUY if you have a MP3 supported car stereo, if you plan on playing at your computer.. IT WILL NOT WORK DUE TO ILL CONCEIVED PIRACY PROTECTION!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Guess I'm in the minority about this, but this PLAY (NOT a MOVIE) left me thinking that I wasted my money.  I enjoyed Madea, she is a great character.  I never seem to care about the rest of the people or their problems. For me the only thing funny about it was when Madea took the stage, the rest of it was simply boring 
 When trying to download information to the Ipod, I keep getting error messages reading Ipod is corrupt and it asks me to restore the Ipod.  Sometimes the software will recognize the Ipod and other times it won't.  I have installed and reinstalled the software several times, but it does not seem to fix the problem.  
 My first Philippa Gregory book was "The Queen's Fool"  which I throughly enjoyed.  I could not waited to have time to sit and read!  So as I was towards the end of "The Queen's Fool" I began to see what other books were available by this author.  I bought "The Virgin's Lover" since to seemed to follow "The Queen's Fool".  Within the first 36 pages, I was completely frustrated at the layout of the novel.  TOO MUCH BOUNCING ABOUT WITH THE TIME FRAME.  And the time frames within the book do not match those in "The Queen's Fool".  For instance, in "The Queen's Fool"  Queen Mary dies in Winter 1558 but in "The Virgin's Lover" The Queen dies in Autumn 1558.  Another example is Lord Robert.  In "The Queen's Fool" Lord Robert lives at St. James Palace (Autumn 1558) and presses Queen Mary to name an heir (Winter 1558).  However, in "The Virgin's Lover" Lord Robert is low man in court with no where to go but to his wife's StepMother's.                                                                   I think part of the problem with this type of time framing is the use Seasons.  Winter 1558....is this November December or January February?  Because further in the book the use of Winter 1558-59 is used. The back and forth at the beginning of the book set me up to confusion a few later chapters into the book.  I spent more time concentrating on keeping the time frame correct then actually enjoying the book which must be quite evident by now with me taking the time to write this review 
 new york city used to be cool, yeah.  if i'd gotten this album when it came out i might be saying the same thing about sonic youth!!  then i might not have looked into murray st. and sonic nurse.  i, um, showed up a little late so instead of toyning me off to the band it just sort of collects dust on the shelf.  oh well 
 I like Ogilvy's premise that we should stop striving toward a distant Goal and be more artful about the small details of living. Unfortunately, though, most of the book goes off the deep end into unreadable  philosophical abstractions ("Narcissism Degree Zero,"  "Semiotics and Sublimation"). Most readable are the stories about  real lives -- the author's, Howard Hughes's, Lila's, Spike's. If you're  interested in this topic, your time is better spent reading Julia Cameron's  THE ARTIST'S WAY or Thomas More's THE SOUL OF SEX 
 I just finished reading this last night, and I couldn't wait for it to end.  By this I mean I'm ready for my next read.  G.G.'s deliberate way of misnaming the characters and providing little if any detail of their  surroundings left me unattached to anyone in the book.  Too bad 
 I ordered two of these in King very disappointed very poor quality item cotton is very hard seams coming apart every where loose threading returned asap The abigail quilt I purchased from amazon was excellent. 
 I am by no means a computer idiot, I audit computer systems security for a living. I have had to contact customer support (webchat) at least 3-4 times during the first 30 days of installing the software. The install was on a brand new system (Windows XP Pro), with all of the Microsoft patches and service packs and little to nothing else installed.   First Pest Patrol would crash numerous times a day until technical support walked me through a complex workaround to prevent an Active Protection error window appearing over 100 times every 10 minutes (which you had to click to clear each one). Second, the firewall would tell me I was not authorized to visit certain webpages until technical support walked me through a complex process of deleting certain files created by the firewall and resetting the firewall after a process involving safe mode. Third, Pest Patrol never would run a thorough scan. I'd receive two separate errors that either said a fatal error occurred with the Pest Patrol GUI, or that system resources was not available. I contacted the customer support and they told me that yes, sometimes Pest Patrol doesn't work at all unless you use MSCONFIG to disable all startup services (systems.ini, etc) reboot, run Pest Patrol, then use MSCONFIG to enable the startup services. It was a canned reply during a live web session, which means that the operators were probably used to giving since it likely occurs to many people.  I haven't tried out the third solution yet because I wanted to remind myself to write an Amazon review.  If you are looking for simplicity, or don't know much about computers, look elsewhere. Otherwise you will be in for one major headache trying to implement several technically involved workarounds. I'll give it two stars, since it didn't cause my dog to choke, explode my house, or cause irreparable damage to clothing (which is my one-star).  
 When I first bought it for myself and skimmed the first few pages, I was very excited about the book and thought that it would be a worthwhile read.   As I kept reading, though, it became increasingly apparent that this guy was just trying to sell copies of his book, and didn't have much worthwhile information to say.  He constantly repeats that he is showing you how to "get rich" without providing any substantive advice.  He repeats lists that have little or no value, including things like "Work Hard" over and over again.    From the outside in it seems great, but after going through it you will have learned very little from the book. All of the worthwhile information in the book could be sufficiently summarized in two paragraphs. I find it hard to believe that most of the other reviewers actually read the entire book.  Do yourself a favor and read the better books out there, like Clason's the "Richest Man In Babylon. 
 Take basic baby Wicca. Add dragon images. Stir it all together like paint or a bad mocha. End of book.  Dungeons & Dragons literally has a better draconic cosmology. Any skilled practitioner of an established occult system could cast better spells with a D&D book and their pre-existing discipline.  Avoid this book, unless you simply wish to add to your established collection of "all books that include dragons". The second star is because it does have some cute pictures, and details that could be added to a fantasy roleplaying game 
 The fan works, however, when I first start up the computer the fan is a little noisy.  I'm concerned about how long the fan will function 
 If you are looking for useful information to cooking questions you've always wondered about, look elsewhere.  Harold McGee's "On Food & Cooking" and Shirley Corriher's "Cookwise" are both full of useful and interesting stuff.  Wolke tries to be cute, and some may like his sophomoric style, but I couldn't get past the first chapter.  Now who do I know who is dumb enough to like this drivel 
 I dropped out of this one by about page 200.  I have read and thoroughly enjoyed Neverwhere and Stardust so I was eager to read this book.  Unlike the earlier works, American Gods failed to engage me. I love to lose myself in a good book, to feel like I'm part of the story; but when your main character is unaffected and apathetic to all that's going on around him,as Shadow is, it tends to make the reader feel the same way.  I'm sure if I hung in there it would have picked up a bit, but I don't like having to work so hard to turn pages. Life is just too short and there are a lot of good books out there 
 I didn't understand why so many people liked this book many years ago when I read it, and I don't understand it any better today.  A lot of people said they thought it showed a good perspective of the corporate climate of the eighties, but that was only a tiny part of the novel.  Stick to Liar's Poker or Bombardiers for a better look.  Most of this novel is taken up by a ridiculous crime story.  There is not a single sympathetic character, so it is like spending however many hours in a room full of highly unpleasant people.  Not only are they un-likeable, they are also unrealistic and they make unbelieveable decisions.  The young, energetic stock trader who is all charm and confidence in one scene is suddenly socially awkward and unpopular in another scene.  The smart, tough lawyer sends his client off to a romantic tryst wearing a wire, even though any idiot would know the chances of his taking off his shirt would be very high.  Other characters are just caricatures: the overzealous civil-rights activist; the arrogant cop; etc.  I seem to be in the minority, but I thought this book was dismal.  Tom Wolfe should stick to non-fiction, which he does well 
 Although I am a big fan of The New Yorker, I'm sorry to say this book did not make me laugh. I found it too obscure and I felt stupid I was not familiar with all the proper nouns. The one story here that is an exception is Larry Doyle's "Life Without Leanne," a wonderfully-crafted and indeed funny short short. I was hoping for some basic humor in this volume about everyday life, which follows other recent collections The New Yorker has put out in recent years ("Wonderful Town," "Nothing But You," etc.), and am sadly disappointed 
 The fact that you are even looking for a book on style is proof that you are far too sophisticated for this book.  It is filled with the dullest, most over-used "style" tips in fashion history - make your "classic" pieces neutral in color?  change your look by changing your accessories?  Mon Dieu! This is not advice on French style... this is recycled notes from 'fashion 101' pieced together from ancient advice and common sense.  To add insult to injury, the pages are mostly filled with photographs of boring clothing "combinations" that were probably already dated before the book even hit the publisher's office.   
 Spongebob IS  making an obscene gesture.  Personally, I don't think it is an appropriate toy for children.  Anyone that thinks Spongebob is merely "pointing" a finger shouldn't be so naive as to how toys are marketed and the moral decline of our society!! 
 Even though I would agree that "Erin Brockovich" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in "Pretty Woman."  I am second to no one in enjoying a good "David and Goliath" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the "true" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones.  However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich's story, in the same way that the "Xena" character is the main attraction in "Xena: Warrior Princess" (though it should be noted that Xena's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character).  Erin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in "Pretty Woman" (prior to Richard Gere's character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree).  The movie's beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel.   Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney's (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk.   Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller's medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric.  Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG&E had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium.  This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG&E (by and through the representation of Erin's boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs.  Roberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired "work clothes" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests.  Albert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and  weary attorney who is Erin's boss.  The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters.  Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin's boyfriend-by-convenience.  The "convenience" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin's benefit exclusively; she  unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case.  Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar "bonus" check  (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a "thanks" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers.   The plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant.  Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source.  Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich.  Is the movie entertaining-absolutely.   Inspiring- not even slightly. 
 I've had this thing for two weeks.  Coming from the Blackberry 8700c, this phone is a big disappointment.  Work issued this and took away the Blackberry and I'm stuck with it.  All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.   The more I use the thing the less I like it.  Here's my list, good and bad.  * Battery life - attrocious.  Use the extended battery, throw away the standard one.  Trust me.  Grade: D.  * Navigation - cumbersome.  The keys are too small, the 5-way nav with buttons get pressed accidentally.  Workable if you don't have huge hands.  Grade: B  * Windows Mobile - I hate it.  Why do applications not quit when you end them?  Instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the task manager.  The menu is pre-loaded with goodies to buy from Cingular, how convenient.  Grade: C+ if you bother to learn the shortcut keys.  * Java is broken, Google email doesn't work.  Maps DOES work with the new version, thankfully.  Grade: C.  * No standard headphone jack.  HELLO??  This is suppose to be an MP3 player, right?  Somebody explain to me why this is OK.  Grade: F.  * Phone quality - Grade A.  Yes, they did something right.  The phone works great, reception is great, speakerphone is great.  Bluetooth is great.   * Outlook & email - This is workable, but difficult.  You can write an email, you can edit your schedule and tasks, but it's not easy.  If Blackberry gets and "A" (and it does), Blackjack gets a C.  It doesn't synch notes, so if you're an Outlook Notes person you're just left out, sorry.  Why??  * Hardware quality - Very good, B+.  The thing really feels solidly built.  The screen is vibrant and attractive.  The camera seems to work fine, although I may use it twice per year.  In short, if you really want to get work done on your phone get a Blackberry.  If you want a phone that does a lot of things poorly but looks nice, this could be the one for you. 
 I must say I enjoyed the book, but the ending was so sudden, with so many things left hanging, that I was disappointed.  I wish one more chapter had been written to clear up- how did Manderly catch fire, what did they do when they got to the burning house, and how did they pick up their lives. All we had at the ending was ashes. Also, the narrator, who never gives her name, was sometimes very odd- hiding behind doors in her own home, sneaking food, hiding behind chairs. The book is worth reading, but I wish that, instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea, Du Maurier had written a better ending. 
 I bought this book expecting to have some practice questions and some tutorials on the subject matter that I will inevitably have to face during the actual ACT.  The only thing that it really gave me was just the type of information that was going to be on the test, but no workable problems or tutorial information on subjects that I have either never taken or am rusty at for lack of practice.    This book, in my opinion, was a waste of my money and did not fulfill the objective that I had previously expected it to 
 This is not a complete book, and that was not clear.  It is missing Books 4 and 6 and the appendices (about half of the original 1920 text) 
 I don't know why I am so bored of this book.  The guideline is very subjective.  I would say it can't be applied in real life -at least for the Ph.D. that I know.  One chapter was dedicated to "Diplomatic with committee members".  It might be true for the author's case.  Also, it might applicable for many cases.  But what?  One dedicated chapter for diplomatic?  You're kidding me, right?  I can't imagine what happen if every one follows this guideline and spend their time for diplomatic playing, instead of researching.  Myth and fact are not the case either.  Myth is not myth and fact isn't true.  Please don't wait your time on this book.  "Tomorrow's professor" or "Get what you came for" are much much better 
 A Moose from California compared Audra's "Bill" with one done by Jane Monheit. I took his advise and listened to both. Audra sounds like a church choir singer making an attempt at jazz. The Moose from California has a tin ear when it comes to quality and soul.This is a sad recording as far as jazz goes. It should be in the cabaret bin. Absolutely!! 
  Kwok is on fire in this movie with maybe his best physical performance ever. He looks like a pop star but his acting is actually very good. Unfortunately, his performance is completely wasted in a movie this bad. I won't explain the story, it is cops vs. drug dealers. There is a beautiful fighting female, good car chases, big name stars, and good fights. How did this movie go wrong? Well, Stanley Tong is a decent director, but he is a stuntman, screen fighter, and martial arts choreographer at heart. He tries to make this an American movie but he disregards everything that gives feeling to movies. I cracked a smile more than a few times but this is the most mindless modern day film I have seen in a long time. Usually, I am able to get past all of this since I am a sucker for good fight scenes, and this movie does have a few. Highlights to watch for are Ken Lo vs. Marc Dacoscos and Dacoscos vs. everyone in the final fight. The thing that ruins this movie is that the real final fight never finishes, but instead it moves on to a totally ridiculous fight to finish off the movie. 'Cradle to the Grave' has a better end fight! Stanley Tong must have been out of his mind because in the finale, Coolio ends up as the main opponent. Not Ken Lo who is the leg fighter that faces Jackie Chan at the end of 'Drunken Master 2', and not Marc Dacoscos who is one of the very best modern day martial arts actors, but Coolio.   I honestly thought this was a good cheesy movie, but the final fight sequence is just horrible. Stanley Tong comes up with a great idea having the actors fighting on a huge piece of glass hundreds of feet in the air and they have to keep their balance while they fight. It is just too bad Coolio had to ruin it. 2.5/5   DVD from Dimension Home Video has good sound and picture quality. No special features except the outtakes in the credits which was a much more satisfying end to the movie. 
 While I generally share Joe Consason's political sensibilities, and I am a fan of his column on (at?) Salon.com, I found this book to be a disappointment. Too often Mr. Conason seems utterly scandalized by minor transgressions on the part of Republicans/conservative pundits, or posits innuendo as fact. To be fair, at several points he does intelligently treat some genuinely egregious instances of mendacity, hypocrisy, and/or venality on the part of the American far-right over the last few years. Here his commentary is illuminating, and his conclusions are sound. Also, throughout the book, one never gets the sense that Mr. Conason is motivated by meanness or vindictiveness in any of his contentions. Yet ultimately the book can be characterized by (dare I say) what are at times partisan and dubious assertions.   (For a truly sober, superbly researched, and utterly convincing look at the ascendancy of the far-right, and what has been a well-financed (and highly successful) campaign of distortion, read Eric Alterman's superp "What Liberal Media." 
 I bought it for my son to use with the Original Pixter also. And,I found what it was compatible with, after I realized that it didn't work with the original Pixter. The box I have says down in the bottom right corner (if the back of the box is facing you) of the back of the box in tiny print "compatible with Pixter Plus and Pixter 2.0".  You would think they would put that on the front 
 At the end of this film Gene Hackman's character, strung out thanks to his surveillance heavy lifestyle, finally snaps and pulls apart his house in search of a mythical bug. This scene concludes an examination of the psychological toll that surveillance takes not only on the listen-ee but also the listener. Hackman plays Harry Caul, a surveillance expert who is at the top of his field. He gets assigned a mysterious conversation that he has to piece together throughout the film. More interesting to me was to see all the little ways that his job affected his life. He staunchly defends privacy, even though it is his job to invade it. He refuses to open up to people because he is paranoid that anything he says will be used against him. I know that today it is very fashionable to criticize Bush and his wire tapping program but this film only piles on. The chilling affect we watch take place in the world of Harry Caul is a microcosm for what is happening in our world today. Simply because you are aware of Bush's spying ways causes you to engage in self-censorship every time you send an email or talk on a cell phone. Harry deals with the reality of his situation by descending into madness, and while that may not be healthy I'm not going to be the one to say that he is handling it the wrong way.  While there are lessons here that deal with living in Bush's America, this still isn't a very good film. This is a much smaller scale than Coppola usually deals with and it doesn't seem to be a very good fit for him. The script was original and unpredictable. However, it was also slow and filled with nonsense. I watched the film twice and still don't have a firm grasp on what happened at the end. Also, the scene in which we visit Harry's twisted dream was a total miss for me. The purpose was to show just had mad he had gone. To me it looked like Coppola losing control of his script and inserting a scene which only served to take the viewers out of the film. Hackman gives a good performance which was the norm for him pre-"Unforgiven."  A dashing Harrison Ford is trotted out to remind us of just how old he has gotten. Still, this film falls flat.  Most of the film involves Harry trying to figure out the entire conversation. The tools he is using look downright quaint compared to what we know Big Brother is using today. I liked the way this film reminded me of "Rear Window." As in that film we watch as a lonely man has his imagination run away from him. It is a theme that affects us in our daily lives. Every story we hear has holes and lies in it. We have to fill those holes and sort out the BS to come to a perceived reality. But what if we're wrong? Nobody likes being called paranoid and nobody likes to be asleep at the wheel. If for no other reasons watch this film to explore these ideas. Then think about whether your communication behavior is paranoid or ignorant, and whether your Ok with your cell phone coming with a built in bug. **1/2  
 ... I don't recommend this book. I enjoyed it all the way to the last page. But after receiving several paper cuts trying to find the additional pages that should be there, I felt like I was "R", the main character, trying to determine if someone had pulled a hoax on me. That said, if there is a part 2 (I haven't found anything indicating there will be), I'll buy it. Mr. Lehrer raised a lot of interesting situations -- I'd like an end to complement the beginning and middle 
 Like a few others, I don't understand why this novel is getting so many positive reviews.  Perhaps I was spoiled by "Memoirs of a Geisha" and "The Good Earth", but I found the writing lacking and the dialogue boring.  Great plot line on paper, but I don't think the author did it justice!  Couldn't wait to just get through it and be done with it 
 It's great that little girls who are being potty trained are learning that they have a 'pee pee' and all, but what the heck is a 'pee pee' anyway? I always thought that 'pee pee' comes out of a 'wee wee' and not the other way around.    I was originally intrigued that there were both 'boy' and 'girl' books...is their anatomy so different that they need different books? Apparently not, as the 'once upon a potty-girl' book also says that girls have 'pee pee's'...So I guess the only difference is the color of the flowers...not sure why you need separate books. It's nice though that they have a spanish version of this volume too so our espanol speaking friends can teach their children the value of gender differences too...blue for boys, pink and purple for girls. Maybe the chamber pot style toilets in the book actually exist in a spanish speaking country somewhere...maybe... 
 I bought this from Motherhood and hated it!!! It is too narrow and so puts a lot of pressure on your hips and pelvic bones, which any pregnant lady knows- our bones are already moving and don't need more help!! The mother ez belt was fabulous though!! I wore it for the last 4 months!!!  Forget about this one though!!! 
 I'm sure the info is okay, and the auther seems like a really nice and experienced person..  BUT, the writing style makes it difficult for me to follow..  Some sections of the book literally have no paragraphs- just pages filled with margin to margin text!  Other sections have a paragraph every other sentence!!  I'm not some kinda grammer buff or anything, but I do get frustrated when the formatting of text is so bad that the text is difficult to follow or read!  I mean, we pay good money for books- they should be done right.  Additionally, the focus of what is being talked about jumps around too much- he'll be talking about doing some gun mod or other, then throw in an little side story that's not 100% relavent, and then he won't tie it back into what he was talking about- he'll just move on to a new, unrelated topic!  It's like stream of thought poetry in some parts, and is so hard to get through that I've stopped trying to read this book for a while- maybe I'll come back to it.    I want to like this book- it seems like the author has a lot he can teach, but I just can't stick to reading it because of the style.  I didn't want to post this review because I hate to smash someone's work.  But, I bought this book based on the other, glowing reviews- and I think people considering purchasing this book should know the whole picture.  
 David Bowie always walked a thin line between commercially acceptable and just plain commercial.  This is the first time he fell off and became just plain commercial.  A disco-esque record, it's remembered more fondly than it was received by Bowie fans at the time.  It has some good moments, but overall the production is just too slick and there's a dearth of imagination on it - China Girl is an old Iggy Pop song, Cat People is just a newer version of a previous single and Criminal World is a cover of a song by Metro, meaning there's a grand total of five new songs on it.  China Girl proves a perfect foil for Bowie's melodramatic vocals, Cat People is still great even when smothered in too much production and Modern Love proves that you're (nearly) always gonna get at least one classic on a Bowie album.  Ironically, while it made him a global megastar, this record also marked the start of Bowie's alarmingly swift fall from grace.  If he'd stuck to the highly original work he'd churned out before this, he'd probably have had his moment in the sun anyway... and nobody could have accused him of selling out.  Now, what's that they say about hindsight 
 I had to read this book for english class. It isn't all that great, it's too melodramatic at some point and too classic. The only good one is the character of Colonel Wain which is an interesting one because of it complexity 
 This is just a REALLY bad book.  First I blame James Patterson, but I really REALLY blame his editor.  What editor worth his salt would allow this mess to be published?    The villains are so grotesque as to be almost cartoon villains.  Just - over the top. The plot line is unbelievable.  Aside from Alex Cross and the two villains, nobody in this book gets more than a few pages before they disappear forever.  Alex Cross spends more time eating meals than using the resources of the FBI to foil the villains.  This is supposed to be one of those "the villains have given us a deadline before they blow up the world" type thriller but - there's no sense of urgency, and the law-enforcement agencies on the case are poorly sketched, and inept (but not deliberately written that way).  I could go on and on but it's not worth the words.  This book is REALLY a waste of time.  I can't believe anybody published it 
 Not one recipe for flying fish in the whole book!  What a disappointment 
 I think this book is very repetitive and is a very poor attempt at showing why losing all of these languages is important.  They are comparing losing these languages to animals and plants going extinct.  They try and draw all of these worthless comparissions that do not make any sense.  This book is not even worth being picked up 
 This book is interesting and worth reading because its subject is interesting. For too long, the suburbs have been treated largely as an object of satire or contempt.   Baxandall and Ewen do a good job of contesting this stale perspective, but the book's focus on Long Island  - and Levittown in particular, seems unnecessarily narrow, even parochial.   They appear to be totally unaware of the similar Levitt developments - also named Levittown - in Pennyslvania and New Jersey.  Surely, these might have provided the basis for some useful comparisons.  Likewise, the authors appear oblivious to the landmark NJ Supreme Court "Mount Laurel" decisions of the 1970s and 1980s, (chronicled in David Kirp's much better  book "Our Town"') which have had national implications for housing policy and which offers a direct challenge to Baxandall and Ewen's claim that developers have shown no interest in low income housing.  The authors don't even make very good use of the apparently extensive interviews they conducted with Levittown residents of the 1940s-1960s era.  They fail to convey any real sense of the rhythms and rituals of suburban life in this period.  In short, this is not a bad book; just a very disappointing one 
 About 6 years ago I saw a 20/20 feature about this generation's greatest author Thomas Pynchon, and how incredibly acclaimed and mysterious he is.  So I figured I would check out his work.  I had begun reading fairly intensely and wanted to see what all the buzz was about.  I picked Vineland because it looked intriguing, and hey, anything that features lesbian ninjas can't be bad right??  Well, unfortunately the 20/20 segment was far more intriguing than this book.  I honestly don't understand what all the buzz is about.  Maybe it's because I didn't live through the 60's, or didn't grow up in Humbolt county.  But I certainly don't "get" Pynchon at all.  The man has an incredible imagination, but the problem is that the stories he concocts lack almost everything that I treasure in literature.  The characters are quirky, but I don't care about them.  The circumstances are ridiculous, but rarely to the point beyond a half-amused chuckle.  The "plot" wanders all over the place but ultimately leads nowhere.  If there's a point or theme that the author is trying to convey, it's hidden far beneath the depth which I would care to dig.  Looking back, I can't remember the characters, or the resolution.  I just remember it being a very disjointed story.  It's sad to me that someone with Pynchon's obvious mental and literary prowess, can't use them to write something that is moving, or teaches you something.  Something that sticks with you for life.  My recomendation to people who are considering reading Pynchon: if you like Tom Robbins, go ahead and try Pynchon.  For those who want something a bit more substantive, read John Irving.    Note: It IS possible for some of us to enjoy Stephen King, as well as, the acclaimed "literary" scribes like Saramago, McEwen, Umberto Eco etc.  It just takes a little less pretension, and an open mind.    ...and for the record, the lesbian ninjas were a big disapointment.        
 Johnson lumps in "the gay lifestyle" with "alcoholism, drug addiction, sexual perversion, and any number of terrible problems that can afflict a family" (Pg 172). If you find this appalling, then avoid the book because there's a lot more of this.  If that doesn't bother you, then you might find some inspiration here. Clearly many have. If you prefer anecdotes/stories to bullet point advice on how to pick yourself up, this is the book for you.  But to be on the safe side, if you're looking for a role model in dealing with homosexuality in your family, do look beyond this author. While many believe that homosexuality can be "cured" with prayer, it is more widely held (by the medical community amongst others) that this is not a condition that can be cured any more than blue eyes or black hair. Be sure your approach doesn't do lasting damage to your child and your family.  
 This is one of the worst movies ever! It seems to just have been an excuse for the actress and her director husband to show off her naked body 
 I don't know who else bought this but I can't imagine what would have happened had we waited to actually get INTO the bed before we turned the thing on...IT FRIED.  Then they tried to charge me the postage and handling when I returned the item.  They did get that quickly straightened out but it was a very frightening purchase.  Always test a product before you risk it on your self or others 
 Putting aside the entire subject of the atrocity, this movie is absolutely horrendous just for the infamous cat scene.  I strongly disagree with any attempts to justify such unnecessary cruelty as art and I think that one scene waters down his the entire message of the film.  After watching that scene, the rest of the movie is simply about the shock of seeing an innocent animal being slaughtered for entertainment.    I am missing point?  Probably.  But when someone spews out garbage like this one, I hardly can be blamed.  In the interest of art, I would be more entertained in seeing the director being thrown to a pack of hungry rats.  That would truly be educational 
 The cover grabed me powerfully,  The back cover really drew me in, but the lack of sound docrine turned me off.     he quoted Matthew 19:18-19 and alluded to the fact that Jesus is promoting moral relatavism when he edits the ten comandments.  if you read Matthew 19:16-26 you will see that Jesus was saying that If anyone is perfectly rightious on his own without God then he need not follow God's religious precepts or teachings.  In other words he will get into heaven on his own merit.  But scince that man couldn't give away all of his belongings he harbored greed within his heart and therefore needed the perfect sacrafice of Jesus Christ to clense him of his sin in order for him to enter the kingdom of God.  Never neglect the Spiritual gift of discernment!    Beware of pressure from above, and pressure from below.  The Globalist agenda turns belivers against each other so that the kingdom of Satan is advanced.  It takes all sides to all of the issues in order that no matter what they win.  They use their power to minimize the number of ideologies on the "market" so that they can gather everyone in to a camp of the same ideology.  They Give leaders to the camps and then they let them have it out.  no matter what now they have won, and stand to profit.  For it is their leaders who make the changes they want.  The law of power is that the more power you have, the more you have to protect and gain more.  Governments just tell us what to do a great deal.  They are not the source of power.  The money is.  The wealthiest families of the world do not give up all for the poor,  but instead have gained constantly for Centuries!!!  as the poor have died  this is not a battle of poor vers rich.  The battle has already been won, by our lord and savior Jesus Christ.  Weither Slave or freeman, I am free in Christ 
 I love Myrtle Beach and all of the South and was very excited to read a Southern author.  What a huge disappointment!  I'm curious how this is a National Bestseller as advertised 
 As noted already by another reviewer, if you do read this book, please read "King Leopold's Ghost" by Hochschild.  The latter is a wonderfully written account of a nightmare society that was built with Stanley's willing cooperation (Stanleyville was named after him).  Moreover Hochschild's account is the result of years of research in libraries to reconstruct a history that King Leopold, Stanley's backer, sought hard to obliterate.  When you read headlines today about atrocities in the Congo today, be aware that Stanley is very directly responsible for what has happened.  To give you an insight into the man, his contemporaries report that he enjoyed shooting Africans for sport.  Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" is based on his own first-hand experiences in the Congolese slave society that Stanley helped to build.  Too many good people sacrificed lives and careers to bring this to light, for people to now ignore the truth 
 If you're new to the postmodernism question, then this book isn't for you. Better to start someplace else. And if you been looking at postmodernism for a while now, you've probably already read other, more extensive works by the authors of this volume, so you don't need to read this book either. So basically, there's no good reason to read this book.  And if you were going to read it, you would have a hard time because of the way its laid out design-wise. Being postmodern and all, Zondervan tried to design the inside of this book as "with-it" as they could. Unfortunately, while I enjoy postmodern book covers, when that same style is applied to the insides of a book it can make for some very tedious reading. Much of the text is printed as a light shade of gray using an italic font, which, as any graphic designer reading this review will tell you, is a big no-no. It just makes for hard reading.  Oh, and future editions of this work should edit out Fredica Mathewes-Green's attemps at humorous commentary throughout Horton's piece.  Cheers 
 A very strange film about a seemingly (physcially) normal adult male who has the mentality of a baby - he's looked after by his mother and two sisters who treat him as a baby.  Then a social worker takes an interest in the case. She has certain 'designs' on him, but not like one of his sisters who casually gets in his cot one evening for a bit of a quickie - obviously he's all adult physically - but this scene is not very explicit and rather quick. 
 Let me cut right to the chase, there is only really one semi-noteworthy song on this album and it's "Four Leaf Clover". I realize Winger's early works were quite pubescent and lacking substance lyrically, but the music itself did not lack substance. When Winger matured lyrically with "Pull", the band seemed to feel that the music also needed to make a shift. I think the best of both worlds would've been to maintain the great melodies and hooks inherent in Winger's early material with the lyrical substance of the bands latter works.  While I don't think "Pull" was bad musically necessarily, I think it lacked some of the really catchy hooks and melodies inherent in Winger's earlier work to some degree, however there was still a melodic thread that ran through many of the songs. If I were to rate Winger's early works as a five, I'd rate "Pull" as a 3 1/2.  With "IV", gone are most of the melodic elements that made me a Winger fan in the first place. Instead, they've been replaced with grungy / bluesy / somewhat more progressive rock elements. The levels of melodic interest seem (for me) more and more brief with each passing album, in my opinion.  The acoustic intro of "Right Up Ahead" gave me hope that the album was off to a good start, however once the song kicked in I thought, "WHAT are they doing?" It's supposed to sound hard and dark but it really sounds forced and contrived, in my opinion. However, I do like the first part of the chorus to the song.  "Blue Suede Shoes" had a promising beginning, but the chorus drags on and failed to offer the great melodic payoff I was expecting. I'm a fan of Kip Wingers solo work and feel the verses of the song would've fit well on a future solo album.  I didn't like "M16" from the get-go. It has a progressive/hard feel to it that didn't do a thing for me. Filler.  "Your Great Escape" is up-tempo party rock, in my opinion. The chorus has a slight melodic element to it but it definitely doesn't save the song for me. Filler.  Then we get to another, what I consider, contrived darker song called "Disappear". There's a brief melodic reprieve when the pre-chorus comes in but the chorus really doesn't do anything for me. This strikes me as one of those songs that's supposed to draw in modern rock fans, but in my opinion this song wouldn't serve such a purpose.  I do think "On A Day Like Today" would've made a great addition to a Kip Winger solo album. It's somewhat haunting and has a good feel early on. I think the chorus could've been a bit stronger, what with the haunting first half. This isn't filler but I don't think it's strong enough melodically to fit on a Winger album either.  I don't know what the band was doing with "Living Just To Die". It seems they were going for a somewhat semi-dark, dirty rock feel but I don't care for it. It strikes me as another contrivance. It's not a style I care for at all. Filler.  I found more of the same in the track "Short Flight To Mexico" -- dirty rock that tries to be serious. It doesn't work for me. The beginning wants to sound new and dark to some degree but it just comes across as misdirected, in my opinion. Filler.  Another downtuned modern rock effort can be heard in "Generica". I wish someone would tell Kip Winger the downtuned modern rock thing doesn't work at all for him. It comes across as sounding superficial and uninspired. It might work for Saliva or 3 Days Grace but it just doesn't cut it at all for Winger, in my opinion. This is one of those songs that does offer a melodic digression about halfway through the song which lasts for, I'd say, a good minute and a half. I think it's good (albeit somewhat repetitive) although Kip Winger doesn't really take it anywhere. Overall, I'd have to rank this song as somewhat of a filler.  "Can't Take It Back" isn't what I'd expect from the Winger of old but it isn't necessarily filler per se, in my opinion. This song strikes me as a downtuned semi-rock ballad with harder elements thrown in to make it darker than it would be otherwise. Not what I'd prefer but it's listenable, in my opinion. If "Four Leaf Clover" was a steak, this song would probably be the potatoes.  There's just so much that doesn't move me about this effort. If Kip Winger wants to move the band in a more modern rock direction, that's fine, but please make it modern "melodic" rock, not downtuned grunge / dirty rock that tries to be hard and dark 
 Wowwee! This is a real stinker of a Bond film. Everyone, and I mean everyone is phoning it in. From a bemused Sean Connery, who walks through each scene as if he were a robot to lame characters and flaccid floozies like Plenty O'Toole and the hair-change artist Tiffany Case, there is little to like in this film except for the campy humor.   Even the scenery is cheap. No great special tricks from Q, and dull shots of Las Vegas desert make you want to die of boredom. They even made Amsterdam look boring.   By the time Bond is whacked on the squash by a funeral urn, you wish someone would leap out of the screen and do you a similar favor. A long sleep is recommended before, during and after this film.  Yawn!!!!! 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 I originally picked up this book because it seemed like it had gotten some decent reviews.  I can't stay that I enjoyed the novel very much, mostly because it was slow moving, the characters were all over the place, and the ending was weak.  Don't waste your time reading this novel, pick up something better like The Kite Runner, which has a lot more substance 
 Now that fine arts photography seems to be permanently entrenched in a rut, it seems as though the only way for photographers to get noticed is to become celebrity photographers. It is quite an easy formula: To become a celebrity photographer, one must immerse themselves in the mindless world of celebrities, and, thus through hyperbole and self-insertion into this world of celebrity, one becomes a celebrity him- or her- self. David LaChapelle is no exception to this sappy, self-serving, trend which began the moment Annie Leibovitz ran out of ideas.     It is no coincidence that LaChapelle is so often compared to Herb Ritts. Both of them produce technically strong work that, alas, has no soul. Both their work screams the triumph of style (and such schlocky, narcissistic and ultimately vapid style at that) over substance.    Ultimately, LaChapelle is an empty suit, now that the game in fine arts photography is not about achieving a unique vision -- wrought by years of mastering the craft of photography -- but in being seen as clever and trendy. The whole post-modern fraud -- in which LaChapelle is a routineer fellow traveller, posing as some sort of master of photography -- is predicated on the aesthetic equivalent of a hispter's sneer.    Strangely, though, LaChapelle's work is neither clever, nor hip. If you want clever, check out Weegee. For real hip photos daddy-o, peruse Phil Stern's pix of the Rat Pack. If you need to ride Madonna's coattails to notoriety, then hip is way over your head.    In Hotel LaChapelle, we are left bereft of inspiration and style. Certainly, the overly self-aware artiste gives a passable imitation of same, rather much as saccharine compares to honey. Strip this book of the glitz and the glam and we are left with a young photographer who has quite a store of technical know-how without the foggiest idea as to how he can put it to honest use.    To those comparing the ostentatious affectations of this posuer who fancies himself a photographer to Man Ray or Andy Warhol, pulllllleeeaase! Albeit, Warhol was oftentimes just as pretentious; however, Warhol did have some pretty striking ideas, and some of his graphic (re)creations were brimming over with the stark sensibilities of Roy Lichtenstein or Paul Rand. As for Man Ray, LaChapelle is way out of his league. Man Ray belongs up there with Magritte, Dali and Luis Bunuel; LaChapelle fits in a little better with other trendoids such as the photography staff of Us Magazine.    I find LaChapelle's work more akin to another hanger-oner of the celebrity scene, Yoko Ono. That's my story and I am sticking to it 
 Yeah, that is extreme, but my goodness.  Based on the original spy kids, the kid in me was excited about another movie with 3D glasses~~ Whooooo!  Well, let me tell you, I have seen some bad movies, but this was worse than anything I have ever seen.  There was just nothing there.  I won't go into the "plot" because others have already done it.  I think that if you are 11 years old and excited about watching a 3D film you may like this, but anyone older will be wondering "what is this crap that I am watching?"  In order to give it a fair review, I watched the whole thing and it was just terrible.  Sylvester Stallone must really be hard up for roles because I can't believe that he starred in such crap.    Bottom line, I think the creators placed too much of their focus on making a 3D movie.  Clearly, the plot and lines were an afterthought.  Clearly.  I have to give this movie an F-.  I will never watch it again and if I felt it would sell for more than a few pennies on Ebay, I would get rid of it.  I'll be putting this DVD in my DVD graveyard 
 The author is an African-American militant and he's more worried on pamphletizing his political views than on narrating Prez's life. His views of the Jazz world are extremely naive and he tends to idealize everything related to African-Americans. One's got to be balanced.. 
 Delightfully short in length, "The Good Body" takes a mere hour to peruse and completely read...which is a blessing.  The repetitious cliches used to re-assure women that whatever the body form or shape, the body is good.  There is nothing new to enlighten or educate the reader, and nothing one hasn't read or heard beforehand.  Regardless of how compelling an argument in favor of an unaltered natural appearance the author puts forth, the bottom line is that in our global community looks and body shape DO still make a difference in a woman's life choices and success.  This feminist rhetoric is no different than that which has been preached since the onslaught of "Feel good about yourself" books in the 1960's, 70's and 80's.   
 When I reviewed Franken's "Why Not Me?" I explained that I had read it because I loved "Rush Limbaugh is a Big..." but "Why Not Me?" had fallen short of my high expectations.  THIS book was even MORE disappointing.  The subject matter is worn and the material is not that creative, and sadly, just not that funny.  Honestly, I WANTED to laugh- I LIKE Al Franken, but this book just feels forced, the kind of thing that's churned out just to meet a publisher's deadline and get Franken's face back to the front of book racks (Pre- "Lies..." of course).  It's worth reading if you are stuck on an airplane, or an elevator, or something.  Otherwise, pick something else by Franken.  ANYTHING else by Franken 
 I opened this product and started reading the manual the same day I received this product. I had trouble operating the operating valve and getting it to work correctly. To Fagor's credit, when I called technical service, they called me back the next day. However, the tech curtly said I didn't know how to operate the product and didn't read the manual. After I hung up, I re-read the manual and still couldn't find the help I needed. Annoyed, I spent 15 minutes trying to call them back, only to be put in an eternal loop trying to get through their system to reach tech support again. I wasn't able to get ahold of them, or leave a message, after 15 minutes. I returned the product. I wouldn't buy anything from Fagor. If you're going to buy a pressure cooker, buy it from someone else with better tech support. I've bought many kitchen products via Amazon, and never encountered the uselessness that equates tech support at Fagor 
 I loved the book and the film of THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP when they first came out.  Then I read THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE.  I thought it was horrible.  When they made a movie, I went to the theatre in the off-chance that they managed to make a good movie from a lame book (it's possible).  No.  THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSIRE is also pretty horrible.  The characters are quirky for the sake of quirky.  I never believed them.  They work so hard to be cute and unconventional that they're completely smug and obnoxious, draining all sympathy for them.  Stylistically, it's just confusing.  When Rob Lowe zips over to bed his foul-mouthed sister Jodie Foster, I had to wonder what the filmmakers were shooting for.  Slapstick incest?    I didn't read John Irving for years because, after this, I thought he'd shot his wad with GARP and was just writing the same story over and over 
 I can't believe how watered down and lifeless this album sounds! SOUL ASYLUM released an absolute winner with "Hang Time", a perfect blend of pop, punk and metal. With "And the Horse They Rode in On", I am truly baffled as to what happened. First off, even if you actually like the music here in, the cover is GOD AWFUL!!! And that title! What was going on Dave Pirner's mind?!?! Now, before you lovers of this album hang me, this release has its moments. "Spinning" starts off great and it's a great follow up song to the "Hang Time" album. But from there, the songs are a mixture of hit and miss with no real stand out tracks. And the production makes SOUL ASYLUM sound as bland as your favorite JELL-O flavor. For an ex-hardcore band this is really a low point. The songs sound as if something's about to happen, but in the end we are left wondering what happened. The irony of it all is that SOUL ASYLUM's so called "sell out" album (you know what album!)has more balls than this release!!! Sad but true, but what's even sadder is that Dave Pirner is actually a good songwriter and I'll have to wonder what made his mind so dry as to put this mediocre album out 
 Well, if anything this was a decently written story, with good dialect and character detail. However, this story felt like it was going around in circles without any indication of ever ending. Grafton seems to have an idea of where she wants to go with this story but never really gets there.    The story starts off with PI Kinsey Milhone in her office at night when she hears a knock on her door. She opens it to find Janice Kepler, mother of Lorna Kepler standing before her with the tale of her daughter's mysterious death. Not only this, but she also explains to Kinsey about how no one ever solved the murder because Lorna's body was left to decompose for ten months in her isolated cabin house. They talk for a while about the strange circumstances surrounding her daughter's death until Janice tells Kinsey about a pornographic video that was sent to her house after Lorna's death. This tape leads Kinsey on a wild goose chase of suspects in the red light district and gets her nowhere when it comes to turning over the real murderer.   	Millhone dives even further and searches through the world of Lorna's day job where she uncovers a mysterious lead about an expensive, elaborate project which is angering several people a considerable amount. Kinsey also checks up on Lorna's family members, and with the exception of Janice, all seem to have a motive to murder her Lorna.  	 Not being a fan of these types of novels, I decided to at least give it a chance but this story got me nowhere. By the middle of the novel I wanted to give up and skip to the end of the story, but when I got to the end I had to go back to the middle to figure out how everything ended. I stopped caring about the whole murder after so much more emphasis was placed on so much side stories and it seemed like Grafton did too. The ending left me with a strange feeling and I didn't know if the book had actually ended. All in all, it was just not the right kind of book for me but if you're a murder mystery fan, try any other of Grafton's alphabet themed novels besides this one 
 1 1/2 - 2 stars only. If you want an awesome Hard Rock/Metal CD's that are not OVERKILL like RACER X stick with Van Halen, Dokken, Ratt, Motley Crue, Ozzy, Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Guns 'n' Roses and Whitesnake. I just thought Racer-X would be better. Paul Gilbert is an awesome Axman (Guitar Player), but thats about all the band offers. "Into the Night" is the best song on this collection. If you like Five star Hard Rock go with the bands listed above. This band is just so Metal OVERKILL it's almost funny, it's okay I guess but it's flat after listening to Dokken, Ozzy, and the Crue for so long 
 The information in the book are basic, not deeply developed. Maybe it is good for beginners, not for experienced personnel 
 I understand what Barbara Walker is trying to do, but it really didn't turn out very well.  In an attempt to make classic sexist fairy tales more pro-woman, she simply turned them into flat, boring stories that follow a formula.  Basically, all the women are heroes and all the men are rapists. This book could have been a lot better if it was written more skillfully. 
 Cesar Milan, the so-called 'dog whisperer', bases his training methods on a dog behavior model that is so out of date as to be archaic - from the dinosaur age. He teaches that dogs base all their behavior on their pack status, and that you need to use painful 'corrections' to convince them that you are Alpha. This idea hasn't the slightest shred of evidence going for it.   Yes, dogs do have dominance roles, but that hasn't the slightest thing to do with problem behaviors. Dogs do 'bad' doggy behaviors because they work. Dog guards his food bowl? Dog wants to keep food and knows that growling keeps you away. Dog pulls on the leash? Dog wants to get somewhere faster and knows that pulling speeds things up. The dog doesn't care whether or not you're alpha; he only cares that what he's doing works to get him what he wants.   Technically, Cesar's methods work. But they use force, fear, and pain to teach the dog, when you can teach the same things faster with the proper positive motivation and non-forceful techniques. I have three hyper, active, highly driven Border Collies, and they're all very obedient and mannerly. They don't haul me around the leash, nor do they leap at guests, nor do they ignore me when I tell them something. And I don't need to be 'Alpha' to get them that way; neither does anyone else.   I strongly suggest that you don't buy this item. Good books to start with are Karen Pryor's 'Getting Started: Clicker Training for Dogs', Melissa Alexander's 'Click for Joy!' (also with a great problem solving section), and Jean Donaldson's 'The Culture Clash'. You can easily have a happy, obedient, well behaved dog without causing him fear and pain 
 I did not even received the DVD and how amI going to review the movie. Please tell me how to...... 
 Bland does not adequately connect the medieval and the modern, leaving a gap between the two periods. Further, he is clearly more adept at analyzing the medieval period as his discussion of the modern lacks the same level of critical penetration. In sum, I found Bland's book to be bland 
 Fiona my son has had this book for a little over a year now.  He currently is 27 months and HE KNOWS that the smoke stack, exhaust stack is NOT a funnel.  He may know that because we farm and he knows almost every part of a tractor, but for future printed illustrations, you may want to think about changing that word.  A funnel is used for adding oil and liquids etc...  I'm sorry this may be petty, but I have wanted to bring it to your attention for quite some time.  Otherwise a very good, cute book that is Great for sensory issues 
 sorry to say but not well illustrated and not easy to follow look elsewhere for help in this area...I wish I could recommend options but other then Old House Journal(a monthly magazine) I could not recommend a good trim refrence. I will note a couple of my own tricks though.  First remember that the most complicated trims are usually built in stages or layers.  Second remember that good trim starts with good framing and straight bases (the object you are trying to frame ie: window door opening ect). Last but not least if your painting don't go nuts for the perfect joint.  Caulking can save your day..that does not mean to be sloppy, measure twice, cut once, remember to factor the width of the blade waste; but then use a premium grade (GE Silicone II Extreme) caulk to join butt and corner pieces.  Good luck .. 
 Is this the best the right has to offer when it comes to humor?   No wonder the best comedians are always liberals 
 Bad news all the way around. Card does not work, could not get response from seller 
 The content of the DVD "National Geographic - Is It Real? Da Vinci's Code" appears to be very badly researched. Assumptions made by National Geographic are presented to the viewer as facts. Conclusions drawn are in general not supported with plausible evidence. The views projected are bias and I wouldn't be surprised if the Catholic Church was the main sponsor of this movie. All in all a highly disappointing DVD 
 If you look in the dictionary under "turbid," you'll find a photograph of the cover of this book (to intentionally misquote Rodney Dangerfield).  I have an M.A. in philosophy and a long-standing interest in this subject, but if you can learn even one thing from this book, then you're a far more perceptive reader than I.  Recommended only for masochists 
 One of the most fascinating aspects of salt is that it is hygroscopic.  That is due to its chemical nature, it is slightly cooler than "room temperature".  Consequently, water will form on the surface of salt from the atmosphere if it is even moderately humid (hence the reason why most of us put rice in our salt shakers - to absorb the water salt collects).  You do not have to be a brain surgeon to understand the process.  Imagine my surprise when I found in the very first chapter, Kurlansky waxing on whimsically about how he tried to "cook" all of the water out of his pet salt crystal so that water would not come out of it and dissolve the surface.  I figure that he knows that salt is made up of NaCl (although I now have my doubts) and there is not much room for water in its crystal structure (almost zero water in it).  Here is a guy that has written an entire book on the subject salt.  I presumed when I purchased the book that he would be somewhat of an authority on the subject.  To say the least, I have to question his abilities to write a book on salt based on the fact that he does not have the foggiest idea about one of the most interesting properties of his subject.  Wow.  This is a case of a good writer attempting to write on a subject he forgot to read about.  By the way, a casual search of salt properties on the internet would have given him the correct information.  
 Cute shoes, but extremely uncomfortable.  I am not sure that I will get much wear out of these shoes.  I know my size but I starting to think they sent me the wrong pair.  I am so frustrated with Amazon where shoes are concerned. This is the 3rd pair of shoes I have bought that does not give me a good fit.  I suggest that you buy a 1/2 size larger than you normally wear but you will then probably run the risk of the shoe later becoming too big, it's a catch 22 
 This book was horrible. I bought it for the practice tests, and not only did they repeat the same questions in the same tests on occasion, there were many cases where words were mispelled, or key parts of the problems (such as graphs) were left out completely. This book was of shoddy construction and should be avoided as a tool to study for the economics exams 
 I do not like Parker's style at all.  I can't really say anything else.  It is all in the way you format a song, and I just don't like parker 
 Drab storytelling at its worst, but to compare this to Capote's In Cold Blood is to insult a truly great writer. Those who are so impressed with this amateurish work should go back and read no more than the first chapter of In Cold Blood and then reconsider your flattering comments.  The outstanding reviews of this mediocre work indicate that, aside from the classics, there remains a paucity of worthy literary fiction. 
 Drexler seems to forget that anecdotal evidence cannot be used to justify the type of claims she's making in this book, which is riddled with biased sample and hasty generalization fallacies. Drexler makes sweeping statements about the efficacy of single mother parenting without even attempting to clearly define her definition, let alone establish a double blind study or make any other attempt whatsoever to compensate for her bias. Instead, she relies on anecdotal evidence supplied by individuals who were clearly selected based on whether or not their stories support her conclusions 
 I gave the money to the cashier and its like she handed me a piece of crap !!!! I only bought this CD for my IDOL collection !!! I haven't listened to it since I bought it last year !!!  This cd is just horrible !!! Ruben doesn't need to be singing songs like " WHAT IS SEXY " anyways...thats just comical!!! HE IS THE WORST IDOL YET...AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THAT BECAUSE THEN WE HAVE...FANTASIA? AN IDOL!!! They are both so horrible !!! Ruben Studdard is so bad...and that is the reason he is fallen into the category of " hasbeen "...maybe he can be on VH1's " Surreal Life ". Ha Ha!! 
 Just a rehash of the manual.  Practical Poser is a MUCH better book that really takes you through the intricacies of Poser 6.  Poser 6 Revealed basically teaches you the same the the tutorial manual does 
 THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THIS PUBLISHERS EDITION NOT ABOUT THE BOOKS CONTENT ITSELF.  If you want to know about the content--- be aware that this book is copyright free and in the public domain and you can actually read the entire text free, online, if you are curious about the content of the book and what it is about. I am a person who prefers a real, bound book in the hand to reading on the computer screen or printing off a book onto computer paper.  I learned about this book as it is popular with homeschoolers using the Charlotte Mason method.  This book weaves science content into a story format (narrative format).  About this edition of the book--buyer beware!  I am very annoyed. I saw that Amazon sells three different publishers' versions of reprints of this very old book, before I purchased the book from Amazon.  Of course I am mad at myself for making a mistake, but I am also not happy with the way Amazon markets this Kessinger Publishing's version of this book.  I have had issues in the past with facsimile reprints of antique books sometimes being very hard to read. I took time to research this. I wanted whichever publisher's version has a readable font that is clearly printed.  The way Amazon presently has this item (book reprinted by Kessinger Publishing) set up on their webpage, I thought I was looking inside this book. Imagine my surprise when the book arrived and the printing itself is horrible! I can't stand to read this! Upon double checking this now, I see I made a simple mistake--if you don't want to make the same mistake that I made please read on...  It appears that this Kessinger Publishing version is a facsimile reproduction of the original. The old font type is hard to read. But the more problematic thing is that the ink is blobby and uneven. Specifically, I mean that some parts of the letters are missing (there is white space) while others are blobbed so that the letters don't look as they should, they are black blobs in some parts. I would prefer a book whose text is clearly visible. A modern font is also usually easier on the eyes.  I am very annoyed as this is not even the cheapest price edition of this book which is currently in print! Come to find out there are cheaper versions with nicer and easier to read font!  I am upset with Amazon additionally as the way they have this set up to "look inside this book" brings you to the edition published by the publisher "Yesterday's Classics" which has what looks to be a great font, a nice, clear, modern font and a good printing job. (Also today I received a different book purchased from Amazon by the publisher "Yesterday's Classics" and it is a wonderful printing job and a a nice binding to boot.  I will be returning this book to Amazon. Too bad I have to pay the shipping to return it to them! 
 This book was pretty boring. The last 4 pages was about the only really suspenseful part of the book. I loved the idea of the plot, but I dont like the feeling of having to force myself to keep reading. I like when I cant turn the pages fast enough. 
 I have to agree with some other reviewers. I've seen the original series and I still have all of the episodes of the Showtime version recorded. When I saw this on the shelf as "The Complete Series", I naturally assumed that the discussion of a direct-to-DVD conclusion had finally gotten some results. Instead, it turns out that this should be called "The Incomplete Series". Of course, you have no way of knowing this if you buy it in a store.  There's no indication on the outer packaging of what episodes are included. No indication that it ends prematurely and no mention that the series was cancelled before the conclusion of the storyline.   This show was a single continuous storyline with numerous highly connected sub-plots. Pretty much all of them are left hanging. Unless you want to join a large community of frustrated fans who are unlikely to ever receive any sort of closure, I'd avoid buying the set. (no, there's absolutely no hint of what the conclusion was going to be in any of the commentary or extras, either :/ ) However, if you catch wind of a real conclusion (made-for-TV, direct-to-disc movie or even a simple paper copy of Manny Coto's story notes), rush out and buy this set and enjoy it first.  Yes, it's an outstanding dramatic Sci-fi series with top-notch writing, acting, direction and production. However, the more that you enjoy it, the more upset you'll be at being left hanging. 
 Anyone who has read Reilly's books in the past know he's not a terribly strong writer. However, in the past, he has made up for the poor literary skills with compelling stories. Not so this time. The writing is so bloody awful, even for Reilly, that I can't bear to read anymore. Like mentioned earlier, italics are over used, and he's gone way overboard on onomatopoeia.   Reilly's other books are readable, especially when you need a page turner to distract you from, say, a long plane-ride. This is not one of those books, simply because it's written so poorly. 
 Having never read a Koontz novel before I was looking forward to my first one. So I picked this up. Boy, what a disappointment. For 469 pages all I kept asking myself is what is going on? Why is this happening and what's the point of the entire book? In short, I felt the entire book was a big mess. Koontz co-wrote this book with someone else and it reads like it. It seems that these two guys were locked in separate rooms and wrote two different stories and never bothered to talk to one another while they were writing.  Characters pop up and storylines are laid out that lead to nowhere. One character, who happens to be autistic, can only walk while he completes imaginary crossword puzzles in his mind. Sounds interesting but his story has no plot or ending whatsoever. I have no idea how this characted is connected to the other characters in this book.  For almost the first 50% of this book deals with pieces of what I was hoping would be a much larger, more coherent puzzle. I was waiting for something to happen but it never did. If Frankenstein is still alive than only a few people were murdered and it seems no one actually cared except two cops. Hardly what I would call earth shaking considering who the killer(s) could be.   I think I'll pass on any further Koontz novels for now. I was never a big fiction fan but friends of mine talked me into testing the waters with Koontz, Patterson, Brown, etc. I think I'll go back to by non-fiction books for awhile and save this tripe for the beach 
 The few that I liked use either very thick or very thin yarns. The capelets (shortie capes) definitely don't interest me. The photos are nice. Maybe something will inspire me, but I doubt if I'll be making anything from this book. So far it's the worst poncho book I've bought. 
 The first red flag - "About the author" at the top of this page. Beware of the authors advertised by the major media outlets.  Among other nonsense, this book promotes a failed AA 12-step approach and other myths such as marijuana being a gateway drug. Do yourself a favor and do some serious research instead of wasting your time here. Pathetic and laughable 
 The perfect example of critics falling in love with excessive writing. Supposedly, the sentences Whitehead constructs are beautiful works of art, but I was always taught to keep things concise and precise so the reader could follow the story. Not so here. Whitehead tries to impress with his ability to use a thesaurus. I could forgive it if the characters or story itself were compelling, which they aren't. Whitehead is talented with good intentions, it's too bad critics don't try to steer him in the right direction 
 As far as I know a high IQ has never prevented anyone to rot under ground after death. Call it the great (and eternal) nothingness curve. So, just be a good person and be of some help to the people around you! World needs love not pedantic morons. Of that sort we have more than enough, dont you think 
 Some artists slowly insinuate themselves into your psyche, requiring repeated listenings while their songs to percolate around in your brain.  Not so Amanda Marshall.  Her songs and her vocals, abetted by big label production, come out swingin' for the fence.  Her voice has the flexibility to go from soulful shouting to soulful warbling.  Her lyrics are just as forthright.  For my taste, it's all a bit too strident, too 'out front'.  I prefer the artists that hold something back, that don't tell you everything, the ones that leave some mystery that compels you to play the songs again.  Marshall has more immediate appeal, but one that wears thin sooner 
 As for many of these kind of unknown groups, the music in the album is useless. In the meaning that this music has no use. It is not relaxing. It is not for contemplation. It is not spiritual. It is nothing but electronic esperiments that many vendors try to deliver under the name of "ambient". But ambient music is music. THis is crap. Well differently from TWO A.D. where probably the producers realized that crap is crap and no more crap was good to be sold, because people isn't stupid. TWO A.D. is light years away from this crap. Don't waste your money. Listen the the samples by yourself to grab what I mean. Sergi 
 Sissel has a wonderful voice (listen to Shenandoah), she is very pretty (just look at the album cover), but this album has no heart - it's carefully produced world-pop "lite."  What a treat it would be to hear Sissel take a few risks, using her voice to tell us about her heart, her soul, her pain and her joy 
 I didn't understand the reasoning behind Bianca's opera career (or lack of) either.  An opera singer was considered trashy simply because she stood on a stage?  How ludicrous.  Yet, Vergil claimed often that he didn't care about others' gossip, so why did he say he couldn't marry Bianca if she kept her career, but would travel with her as her lover?  Even more ludicrous. I just didn't like this guy, but Bianca was lovely.  
 I wanted to like this book.  I love historical fiction and mysteries.  But finally, after just a few chapters, I had to stop. The Puritan-era English dialogue Martin writes is just junk--he actually just uses non-conjugated "be" over and over to indicate Early Modern English, and that's just laziness.  Speakers of English did not suddenly begin saying "I am" instead of "I be" only in the last few hundred years.  It's not even necessary to indicate period language, but if you're going to do it, why not make it at least slightly accurate.  When a wealthy noblewoman said "I be impressed," I'd had enough. I threw the book in the trash.  Not only do I refuse to read it, I don't want anyone else to do so, either 
 This book was required for the DE classes at UTexas for a first/second year student, encountering DE's for the first time.  The book is very comprehensive in teaching all aspects of DE's.  However, the book is very dry and difficult to get through.  The worst thing is that is impossible to get through this book without some supplemental material.  For examples, the book uses proofs instead of examples that can be applied to the homework several times.  In addition the examples on countless occassions are like it can be shown through some simple calculations(which they won't show you)(it skips steps) that you can get to some other formula and you're like how did they do that?  In addition the notation/symbols they use are not defined all the time, and this leads to extra confusion when trying to learn something new.  Overall the examples are vague 
 Unfortunately, the far-left has a tendency to support the underdog in all cases. This book is no different. Carter automatically supports the Palestinian 'victims,' but he does not realistically consider the roots and the realities of the situation 
 Read the Unbox terms of use CAREFULLY before choosing this route over a regular DVD purchase.  It is not your usual set of "blah blah" legal jargon.  For example, 3c: "Removal of Software. If you uninstall or otherwise remove the Software, your ability to view all Digital Content you have downloaded to the Authorized Device will immediately and automatically terminate and we reserve the right to delete all Digital Content from that Authorized Device without notice to you."  If you ever remove the Unbox software, Amazon may revoke your ability to view the Firefly episodes you paid for and may even delete them from your machine!  Amazon, I've ordered literally thousands of dollars of stuff through you and always had a great experience; why did you let Unbox create these anti-customer terms of use?? 
 Ulrich leads up to believe that the likes named here are the holy grail of best practice. The list of names reads like the book of deadbeats and the academically challenged, Agilent thrashed its self to a fraction of its former glory by the people he named and we are supposed to kneel in worship. Its leaders were clueless buffoons.  The other three reviewers must be Ulrichs relatives, or on the payroll. If you take on board this rubbish, do your current employer a favour and find work in another field of endeavour. 
 Don't bother buying this edition unless you are absolutely desperate. It has abysmal, distracting typos or formatting problems on every page. You might as well print out the etext available online, go to Kinkos, and have it bound. [... 
 This book might be best described as SOA for managers.  Most of the book covers high level concepts.  In some parts everything is presented as an abstraction, leaving the reader to wonder what the connection with the real world is.  Even as a book focused on a high level overview this book doesn't work.  This should have been a 300 page book.  Who has time to put up with an extra 400 pages?  If your interest is in actually implementing something, you'll need to go far beyond this book.  I've given it 2 stars instead of 1 because I did learn a few things from it. 
 I have been a die-hard Tony Iommi supporter for decades.  When Ozzy left, I supported Iommi.  When Dio left, I supported Iommi.  I followed Sabbath, and still listen to my Sabbath cd's.  But the three Iommi cd's that I have purchased, including this one, FUSED, have all disappointed me.  In this case, it's more about Glenn Hughes, whose voice I find annoying on this effort.  I would love to have seen Iommi team up with someone like David Lee Roth, or when Rob Halford was still roaming solo.  Tony needs a GREAT vocalist, and he comes out strong.  Tony is a great performer, love his riffs, but they are drowned out by the annoying Glenn Hughes on this album.  Heck, even someone like Joe Lynn Turner would have been an improvement on Glenn Hughes.  Isn't Vince Neil looking for a job these days?  Ug, so yeah, this album is ONLY for the die hard Tony Iommi and/or Glenn Hughes fan.  Otherwise, by an older Sabbath album 
 The Encyclopedia of Trading Strategies is well written and is a good book if you are looking for something very technical and mechanical.  I was disappointed with the book.  I thought it would offer chart set ups or set ups per technical indicators.  Instead, it offered codes, etc for setting up mechanical systems. 
 I do not like the way the book is written (frankly). Maybe it's just me, but I like things explained better. I understand everything he is saying and he does give you a step by step list of how to do things, but he DOES NOT tell you the purpose of each of the features of .Mac, which to me is essential. It's almost as if he thinks we already understand what to do with each of the components of membership. He gives absolutely NO examples of what you'd use these things for and all he really would have had to do would've been include a couple paragraphs about it. As I read it's hard for me to follow along because he excludes essential information relevant to .Mac and the use thereof. 
 This "novel" would be better suited for the stage.  It reads like a play, often.  It's not realistic as the author goes overboard in depicting "high drama" within a family.  They suffer a tragedy that would certainly affect a family but to the extent the author has them changing is not realistic at all.  There are far too many scenes of shouting, histrionics.  The father goes from being Ward Cleaver to a verbally abusive monster.  If I had to see the mother one more time with her calling "Robin!" I was going to scream.  The author needs to understand that high drama and a climax will be inferred by the reader after seeing the conflict.  This author forces the climax onto us in every scene.  He's desperate for this end result of angst, high drama and shock.  It's overkill.  I don't believe that a 14 year old would become this promiscuous.  Sure it happens but this was the Leave it to Beaver family at first.  It just doesn't make sense that because of ONE incident, all members of the family devolve into sordid disasters.  In short, the author needs to be focused more on telling a story, allowing the reader to infer.  Instead, he thrusts high drama and climax onto us at every turn.  It's ironic, actually, as he's trying to make us feel drama but he did it so much that I just felt tedium.  Very, very contrived and forced novel.  Not believable.  I do not recommend 
 I bought the Cutter on Ebay for Scrapbooking. BASED UPON CRAYOLA'S ADVERTISING about how it "Cuts where sissors can't reach" (WHICH IS BULL) - thought it would be good for cutting shapes and alphabets -- and felt $[...] was better than spending anywhere from $[...]to $[...] on Die Cut machines and dies. Boy was I wrong!!   You have to hold the button down continuously to keep it powered---which makes your hand ache after about a minute (This thing will give anyone Carpal Tunnel Syndrome!!) (I am sure they designed as a safety feature for kids perhaps, but I can't see how if it is hard for a healthy adult to use -- how a little child's hand can endure this!)   Additionally, no matter what angle you hold it - it is very hard to get the teeny blade to perforate or cut anything properly. Even when moved at a super-snail pace, no cuts are clean. They look as if you tore them out of the paper. I tried over and over, using the directions and then trying many different angles, speeds, varying pressure, to no avail. This thing is a piece of JUNK!! A total waste of my money and time. It sits in my drawer gathering dust. I am tempted to send it directly to Crayola headquarters and I would like to see them make a 3-D picture of an intricately cut flower and bird using this piece of junk.  Yeah right. Don't waste your money 
 Perhaps the author should have written a history of the Northwest, and northern railroads. I found very little of the persona of James J. Hill in this. It is a very historical narritive, not very biographic 
 Ed Greenwood has lost whatever he might have had. The man is responsible for killing my interest in Forgotten Realms RPGs. He has turned magic into somethat that can be bought for a few pennies out of a vending machine. Everyone in the realms seems to have some uber powerful magical item to make free use of. The history of the place has been way over developed and the creatures that are running amok across the countryside, its amazing that there is anyone left alive, but then if someone does die no big deal, just raise them so death does not matter either. Also there are way to many gods, as pointed out in some other book its amazing there is not a god for dinnerware. Also I fully agree with previous article about the man being obsessed with naked women oddly attracted to fat bushy old men, I noticed that in Spellfire and he repeats it in every one he has written, is there one of the Seven Sisters that Elminster hasn't scored with? 
 I tried this bra on in-store.  The bra had a fancy pamphlet attached that explained how technologically advanced the bra is, so I thought it would work really well.  Wrong.  I tried on 6 different cup/band size combinations just to make sure it wasn't a cut issue.  For each bra, I jumped up and down a few times to see what kind of support I was getting. Then I jumped wearing my normal underwire bra.  I had exactly the same support in my everyday bra.  It's possible that this bra works well for smaller cups (I am a 32D), but if they can't support larger busts, maybe they shouldn't try to sell in those sizes (especially at those prices!) 
 I bought this book out of my interest in foreign policy. I was very surprised by the stupidity of the title. Well, once you read it it just becomes more stupid. Its amazing that it was published and that this lady ever got a contract and a PHD. This probably shows how useless and pointless current historical debates are. Don't buy it! 
 I intend to burn this book once the semester is over; it is utterly worthless.  My professor was coerced to use the book and assigns homework from the book, but the exams look nothing at all like the homework or material from the book.  My complaints: Insuffucient examples to teach a concept.  There is an inextricably, monotonous presence of teaching.  The examples are nowhere near adequate to be able to do the problems in the back of the chapter.  Superficially, the content looks great, but when you try to learn it from the book, the frustration builds until you cry.  The wording of chapter exercises and end of chapter problems is vague and problemmatic.  It is difficult to understand what is being taught, if anything is being taught at all.  I would like to use this as a reference when I graduate, but realistically, if it's as useful as cow dung now, then why would I keep it?  So, get it all over with now, the crying, the late nights pulling hair out, seeking antidepressants for the incessant crying and depression due to frustration.  Be realistic in the beginning.  Unless you have an excellent professor, you will probably not make a good grade based on homework and/or exams from this book.  Better yet, don't buy the book - you might get a better grade on the exams if you are exposed to the unnecessary stress.  [This is just an opinion - don't sue me.  If, by some strange reason, you're a math major, then you might have a partial background to cope with the book's inadequacies and take a different view. 
 I thought that this book would tell me about safe places, particularly beaches, where dogs are permitted to run off leash.  Instead, it tells, in overblown prose and for some reason always referring to the dog as  "she," where one may walk one's dog ON a leash.  I don't need a  book for this information. There are some beaches in Florida where dogs are  allowed to run.  I know this because I eventually found some of them  myself.  This book was not a help 
 This book has beatiful photographs - that's about it.  The directions are poor and you cannot see the entire finished  jewelry piece.  This should have been a coffee table book. 
 I couldn't wait to get this book. I really like this groupf of bulbs and I wanted to learn more about growing them and the varieties I could grow and the work being done with them. Well I was in for a surprise. this book does little of that. What it does do is give the reader the history of the plant and its introduction into horticulture. The work that went into it is staggeringbut nothing for the gardener. Infact after reading it I don't think the authors even grow the plants it is treated as more of an object than a plant. this was made worse by no color photos just illustrations. now don't get me wrong they were nice illustrations. but would it have killed you to include some photos.  I can onot reccomend this to any gardener unless you are really into botanic history. 
 Far too religious for me.  I do not think this book presents a healthy way to respond to grief 
 Color shown as natural is far from accurate. I am unhappy with color and may return these 
 This was a hot mess, it was so boring I couldn't even finish the book, I passed it on to my cusion, and she said the same thing, I just gave the book away. My hopes were all high from Flyy Gryl, but thats the only good book that Omar written. I was so upset by this that I actually wanted to write Omar Tyree myself and ask him what the hell was going on. I mean when you write a bad book chances are that no one is going to want to read the next book. I hate reading a bad book because I feel it is just a waist of my time, and I could've done somthing better. Omar, you owe my 4 hours of a good book 
 What rubbish.  Ridiculous situations, and poor writing doom this boring, stupid film.  Probably, the worst film that starred either Lee Marvin or Gene Hackman.  A real hack job that was meant to snare unsuspecting theater goers who liked the stars 
 Not sure why this has got such a high rating as it is a complete waste of time. While 'Saw' had a unique story, this remains in the brain for all of 5 minutes after it is turned off and revels in sadism and ridiculous logic for what seems like an ice age. Firstly Jigsaw should not have been revealed and an attempt to make him more 'human' with a flashback to his former life is just ridiculous. Plus why does he torture people as punishment for leading amoral lives? isn't his just as amoral? The other characters in the film are witless, particularly the man assigned to 'play a game' which is based on showing mercy (or not) to the various people involved in the car crash which killed his daughter, this moron takes far far too long to make what should be split second decisions - watch the scene with the guy in the twister device and you'll see what I mean. We also get the background of Jigsaws accomplice, add to that a convoluted plot 'twist' and you have 90 or so minutes from your life you will never get back. Now *thats* torture 
 The color illustrations in this book are quite attractive and show that there was a lot of time, effort and skill expended in their creation.  However, the text was written on a far more elementary level than I expected .  It would be more helpful for the beginner than for an accomplished photographer seeking new methods and/or techniques to sharpen their interpretative skills 
 This book is an outline with a bunch of forms.  It would have been useful for the forms on cd, except the cd was unusable.  The cd is in an envelope glued which is glued in to the back cover.  Unfortunately too much glue was used and it soaked through the envelope to the CD.  I didn't try the cd until I needed forms, I ended up paying for a different set of forms online and I am stuck with the book because it's been too long to return it!  Don't make my mistake, you can get better forms online and a more useful book is "The Nanny Book: The Smart Parent's Guide to Hiring, Firing, and Every Sticky Situation in Between 
 I used to love Outburn magazine. I first discovered it when I came across the mag at a local mainstream bookstore chain. The first thing I saw on the cover was VNV Nation. I bought that issue and soon after that I ordered a subscription. What I loved about Outburn at the time was that the magazine covered artists and bands that aren't covered in the mainstream music magazines, namely those in the goth, EBM, synthpop, and industrial scene. Unfortunately within the next year and a half, the magazine started covering less of those types of bands and more death metal bands and hardcore punk bands, two genres I don't give a rat's behind about. I don't know WTF happened at the magazine but they stopped covering anything goth related and started covering more music I would much rather have my ears ripped off by pliers than listen to. Just like Alternative Press, Outburn started out as a cool mag but now they have become a joke and more about following than setting trends 
 I spoke with the author of this textbook (he was actually one of my professors at Berkeley for a different class) and apparently this textbook has a whole lot of incorrect information and math in it.  Go buy the newest version by the same author - it's much better 
 My two year old really doesn't like this book.  I got it since all the other books we have by the same author are really cute.  This one is just a grumpy book.  I'm sure there is a lesson, yes, but I will find another way to teach my son that bullying isn't right 
 I have really enjoyed most of the Jury series, especially the interactions between Jury and Plant.  This book, however, fails to deliver in my opinion.  She starts off with a wonderful premise and could have really built upon it....but she didn't.  The book starts to become annoying because she gets lost in "educating" the reader on quantum physics.  I kept nodding off and wondering if I'd ever be able to finish this book.   I skimmed through so much of the last few chapters and still found that you're left hanging at the end.  It's not even the fact that Harry walks away in the end, it's more that Grimes fails to give anything in the story proper closure.    I don't really know what she was aiming at with this one, but it really missed the mark for me.  I agree with the other reviewer who said she seems to be tired of writing Jury.  Even Melrose Plant has lost some luster in this book and he usually shines through in most of them.    I noticed the next title in this series is "Dust" ... I fear that may be a literal description of this series at present.  It's dry as dust to me.  
 I wouldn't go so far as to call it brilliant. Zorba is a refreshing and likeable character, but at times i felt that he was a bit too preachy, his dialogue a bit overly pedantic. The story to me felt a bit too long and choppy, with not much of a plot. But there are a few interesting and beautiful moments that reminds us to enjoy life to the fullest. Like I said, not a brilliant book, but pretty good nonetheless. 
 Boilerplate rhetoric about how the US is the global policeman and no longer a republic but an empire.  We've heard it all before...yawn...  And I even agree 
 Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877 is heavily biased against the South. Yankees have been writing and rewriting southern history since 1865, with disastrous consequences for the truth.  From 1973-1982, he served as a Professor in the Department of History at City College and Graduate Center at City University of New York.  Foner earned his B.A., summa cum laude, from Columbia University in 1963, a second B.A. from Oriel College, Oxford, as a Kellett Fellow in 1965, and his Ph.D. in 1969, under the tutelage of Richard Hofstadter at Columbia.  Jack Foner was blacklisted in colleges and universities in the United States for nearly 30 years after declining to discuss his political preferences with a government committee.  One with such biased views of the South cannot write an objective history of Reconstruction 
 I watched ten minutes of Beanie Seagal trying to act and turned my DVD player off to read a book.  I had to.  I felt like I was getting dumber by the minute for watching that short segment of the movie. It looked so common I didn't even need to see the rest to tell you the end. I'm willing to bet some people got shot, somebody got away with the crime, the police arrested Beanie, and somebody's mother was yelling at somebody. I don't even care if I'm right or wrong because regardless, I'm not gonna finish watching this movie 
 If you are a fan of John, buy the book. of course he was one of the best builders ever on this planet. The book is nice written, but he don't tell you his secrets in this book. Yes it is full of What to do, NOT how to do It, little or no specifications to bring your project to a satisfying end.   Most annoying is the fact,  if it get's difficult his last sentence on the subject is.... get your (whatever part) to Lingenfelter  and we do it for you. That's not the reason for most people to buy this book.  br. Arnoud 
 i have to say i was pretty disappointed by this film.  afterseeing indochine, queen margot, and le libertin, this vincent perezfilm was a sleeper!  not only is the dialogue stilted and undeveloped, but the different accents kinda threw me off.  (vincent perez speaks decent spanish--but his english is tinged with a french accent while the rest of the family speaks english with a spanish accent!) the actors make a valiant attempt at salvaging the movie, but the result is a cheesy, overblown, wannabe epic.  (it's almost painful to watch mary and francisco interact.) while the scenery is gorgeous, there are other films with far better stories, character development, and dialogue.  try belle epoque (with ariadna gil and penelope cruz) or le bossu (with vincent perez) for a better representation of these actors' talents 
 This is not the Richard Ford of The Sportswriter, much less Independence Day; the intervening two decades must have taken a terrible toll on this author.  I found two chapters with dialogue sufficient to engage my interest.  The balance of this novel is filled with so much meaningless, monotonously descriptive narrative that I began to suspect I was reading a New Jersey travel brochure.  I want a refund.  I deserve a refund.    
 Bruegmann makes himself sound like a daring contrarian by saying that sprawl dates back at least to Roman times and is needed to get people out of dense, industrial cities.  Actually, he is just playing with words by using "sprawl" to mean "suburb."  The term "suburban sprawl" was invented during the 1950s to describe post-war American suburbs, which were different from earlier suburbs in obvious ways.  Sprawl was much lower density than earlier suburbs.  Sprawl made it impossible for people to walk, because it was designed with a discontinuous street system (large arterial streets and local streets are either indirect or cul-de-sacs).  Sprawl was designed purely for the benefit of automobiles and ignored the pedestrian; no one wants to walk around a strip mall.   If Bruegmann contrasted sprawl with the streetcar suburbs that were popular in American cities before World War I, it would be obvious that the streetcar suburbs provide all the benefits of sprawl without many of the costs.   Streetcar suburbs let people get out of congested industrial cities to greener neighborhoods where they can own their own homes.  They let people at every economic live in the way that the elite used to live.  They are at least as livable as sprawl.   But streetcar suburbs use less than half as much land as sprawl suburbs.  They have continuous street systems that allow people to walk.  They are designed for pedestrians as well as for cars, with shopping on walkable Main Streets instead of in strip malls.    For the last twenty years, the New Urbanists have been building new suburbs that are like the old streetcar suburbs, claiming that they are more livable and less damaging to the environment than sprawl.  This is one of the most important developments in urban design in recent times, and Bruegmann ignores it assuming that suburb means the same thing as sprawl.   Bruegmann also makes the false claim that people move to sprawl suburbs as a matter of free choice.    In reality, the federal government has given most transportation funding to freeways over the last fifty years, so most Americans do not have the choice of living in walkable, transit-oriented neighborhoods.   In reality, also, most localities in the United States have zoning laws that require you to build sprawl.  New Urbanists who have been trying to build modern versions of streetcar suburbs find that the zoning laws get in their way, that they have to go through endless hoops to build a suburb that is not sprawl.  They have called for "zoning choice" to give developers the option of building sprawl or building streetcar suburbs -- and Wisconsin has enacted such a law.   Let's allow people real democratic choice -- including more transportation choice and the choice of living in suburbs that are not sprawl.  
 This book should never have been re-released.  It is that bad.  Save your time, money, and vision.  None of the characters are believable or likeable.  Meredith's story might have worked if she made her vengeful return to Billings after 10 or 15 years instead of 6.  I have been in the boardroom of a national corporation and 22 year old mothers do not have the depth and experience to head a domestic division even with an MBA.  Not to mention her unfamiliarity with society and lack of professional allies in this rags to riches story.    Cy is totally appalling.  Why would anyone trust him in business or in bed?   And yet our heroine falls for him over and over again.  How stupid.  How could he live with his mother for 30 some years and never ask about his grandmother or his relatives?  How could everyone in town have forgotten who she was if she grew up there?  And what about the mysterious Mr. Smith?  Although called a bodyguard, he acted only as a babysitter.  He could have been interesting.  Wasn't he worth a story line?  He did not even rate a first name.  Unbelievable.  This book was too, painfully long with characters I never cared about.  It was torture to read.  Even the sex was bad.  For people whose attraction was based on mutual passion it just came across as horny sex.  Put this one back in mothballs.  And Diana, do not be afraid to write about a mature woman.  Love and sexual satisfaction can still be a discovery for women over 35 
 The movie tracks Mr. Lazarescu on his last night as he travels in and out of emergency rooms in search of assistance.  The film is realistic, with rare moments of humor and also occasional poignant moments, but ultimately is tedious and almost painfully long.  Yes, you catch a glimpse into a medical system where no one is really responsible for, nor really cares about, Mr. Lazarescu's life.  The situation differs so much from the view we're weaned on, where doctors race to solve problems, that it is valuable to learn about.  The editorial comment that one can visualize how "suffocatingly slow time must seem" for Mr. Lazarescu is absolutely correct, but only because time feels that "suffocatingly slow" for the viewer as well: I saw this movie in theatre and wished I could have gotten up from my seat (in the middle of the aisle) and walked out 
 this cd was a total disappointment  laura pausini falls into the category of "screamer": she strains her voice. it is not pleasant to hear her sing. I would save the money and spend it on something els 
 This was the first Ludlum book I have read.  I bought several and now am thinking I've wasted my money.  He took a realistic story and destroyed it with an unbelievable plot.  All the bad guys, who have so much power that they can have anyone in the world killed within 24 hours of the victim hearing about the Secret Plot to control the World cannot even protect their top masterminds from being kidnapped by a New York lawyer, his consultant ex-wife, and a couple of low-level military officers.  Then, each bad guy willingly spills everything about the Secret Plot merely upon learning that one of his colleagues has insulted him?  Give me a break.  Don't even get me started on how unrealistic the relationship is b/w the main character and his ex-wife.  Give the book as a gift to your 12 year old nieces and nephews, but don't waste your time or money on this if you are over 12 years old 
 This is perhaps the most disappointing King book I have ever read (and considering that I have read "Desperation" and "Insomnia" that is saying a lot).  The storyline was okay until the author lost me by inserting himself into the story.  I have no problem with characters from other stories popping up but for the author to become a character was over the top.  The only thing I found interesting about King as a character was the diaries that appear as the last chapter of the book.  I thought this was a blatant attempt to market his other books by having them referenced throughout the book.  I would guess that anybody that reaches Song of Susannah has read is a faithful reader of King and does not need to be reminded of all his previous works (which as of late have been bad with the exception of "The Green Mile:  Hey, Steve, if I wanted to read an infomercial I'll read my junk mail.  I cannot wait to read the last Dark Tower book so I can be put out of my misery 
 This is a good looking book but disappointed us, somehow there wasn't a lot of useful information in it compared to other guide books! We sold it when we got back 
 I hated this book as much as any book I've ever finished.  It's poorly written, incredibly boring and largely devoid of what any modern reader would recognize as characterization.  Apparently this book has some sort of historical significance to American literature. That's all well and good, but it's still lousy reading 
 I recently purchased this item and figure that this remix compilation is no longer in style. 2004 I still like Blondie, but I was disappointed during checkin' out this cd. I can mark only 2 songs that decent: trk 4. Atomic (Diddy's 12" mix) (back to many years I had that remix) and the only one song that kicks ass, is the last one:  Fade Away And Radiate (108 BPM mix). This cd can be recommended only for Blondie fanatics. I'd rather buy the "best of" with the original versions 
 Will somebody please tell me what the appeal is? Yes, I know it's a classic. But it's a really, really boring classic. The prequel to Charlotte Bronte's, Jane Eyre, is the story of Bertha Mason's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why Bertha went nuts. It's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they didn't like little French girls in Jamaica. Racism, sexism, and classism drove Bertha `round the bend. There. I've saved you the trouble of reading it. Now re-read Jane Eyre instead 
 dont buy this gadget. it is bad choice and the quality of the signal is affull. alot static in the 4 frecuency 
 Elizabeth Peters is one of my top 5 favorite authors ever.  However, this book is really bad.  I couldn't even finish it, and I really hate to stop in the middle of a book.  If you haven't read this yet, don't; read _The Crocodile on the Sandbank_ instead.  If you've already read this, please don't judge Ms Peters by this work.  I urge you to give her another shot, because _The Camelot Caper_ is well below the quality of her other books. 
 This is a thoughtful book with lots of useful information on intuition.  The problem is that the print is so tiny, and I, being over 50 y.o., get eye strain trying to read it without a magnifying lens.  There are also  many typos, misspellings, misplaced commas, incomplete sentences, wrong  grammar, etc., that it reads more like an unedited first draft than a  finished product.  The material is worthwhile but I wish it could be  presented in a less physically painful format.  Clearly, the publisher did  not "already know what to do" with this text.  If it were more  readable, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars 
 Hey, I love the West Coast, as well as California (hope to live there one day). I believe that they can come with the most creative hip hop in the game, and try to support anything that they do. But you do not know how mad I am at this album! When I heard The Dogg Pound was comming with a new album, I couldn't wait to cop it, because comming from some veterans from the west coast (my favorites I might add), I had HIGH expectations from this. This was a very dissapointing album. I guess the flaws are right in my face.   I really don't want to accept the fact that the West Coast fell off, and I keep beliving that they're going to get back on their feet, but this keeps sending me a few steps backwards. Basically the spotlight reviewer "Constant" made the perfect statement about this album. This trio's rhymes skills have been kinda bad lately like on the song "Sittin On 23's". It's like each member tries to rhyme, and they do okay at some points, but fail most of the time. Songs like "Hard On A Hoe" & "Fake***hoes" are just horrible. The album name "Cali Iz Active" you'd think that they would bring as many west coast artists on this album, but they didn't. Lady Of Rage, RBX, Nate Dogg, and Ice Cube appear on this, but the fact that David Banner, P. Diddy, Pall Wall are on this damages the albums image. Also as many reviewers have stated, they're rhyme style hasn't really changed since 1992. Now thats a huge problem.  There are some good tracks on this here, and when I say "good", I mean they barely pass as listenable. I believe the self titled track "Cali Iz Active" was a good one as well as how they brought all the artists from the west in for the video shoot, as I hoped that it would be like that on the album. Although many of the beats are not west coast like, they are still a little nodding like "Keep It Gangsta" although Lady Of Rage outshines Kurupt and Daz. "It's All Hood" is one of those "good" songs on here (as I meantioned what I meant by "good").  Overall, this is not a good album. To me this is a HUGE dissapointment. I denied my self and kept believing that this is a good album, but as I heard it over and over again, it got worse and worse. If anyone remembers when the West was on top of the rap game, knows that this is not the way you bring it back. New listeners, who are unfamiliar of it's domination might like this album. I can't accept this at all.

 The Night Owl Optics monocular had a major flaw as soon as I started using it. The system uses high voltage derived from 2-AA bateries. Occationally the unit would create a large snap(arcing noise) and emit a bright flash of light from the eyepiece. If one is using the instrument, the light actually hurts the eye. I have returned the monocular to Night Owl for repairs. I do not know the result of the repairs as it is still in transit. They told me to ship it at my expense. Another strange requirement of the instrument is that the batteries are recommended to be removed if not used for 24 hours. Other than the above, the monocular has performed well. epilogue-Night Owl Optics did repair the unit and returned it. 
 This book merits a 1, maybe a 2, certainly not a 3 out of 10.  I acquired two guides for do-it-yourself plumbing of my new home construction.  Not one time did I reference the Home Depot "Plumbing 1-2-3."  Luckily, I also had a copy of Black & Decker's "The Complete Guide to Home Plumbing" and referrenced it like a TV Preacher leans on his Bible.  Unfortunately, Home Depot has a ready outlet - it's equally disorderly stores - to hock this poorly organized, code deficient reference book.  For all but a few of the simplest jobs, this book is useless.  If I were a betting man, I'd wager that Home Depot rather tried to immitate better books on Home Plumbing, but, as with all hacks, instead they butchered a forgery into print.  If you're stuck with a copy of this book, as I am, use it for Home Heating 1-2-3 this winter.  Tough luck Home Depot, not only are your stores outfitted with an army of poorly motivated workers, it appears you also stockade a cadre of lousy writers.  Sincerely, Steve Perreir 
 This is certainly the worst of it. At least Lil Jon has good beats and stuff. This has none of that, and it is just annoying. Support better artists 
 I purchased this after reading rave reviews as well as the recommendation by my company and was very disappointed. Even though I have a BA in Business, I'm always looking for new ideas and ways to learn.  However, I was disappointed at how much Charan oversimplified some basic terms and didn't even give a thorough defintion of "velocity" -- one of his key points.  I read in just a few hours and am giving to goodwill -- one of the few books I won't put in my home library 
 While there are many books that provide us with beautiful and harsh truths about our culture, this novel is not one of them. A chaotically written story that bounces around the life of the central character, combined with weak character development and far too many adjectives in every sentence, make this the worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read. The book is wholly depressing and utterly incomprehensible and Ana Castillo is the lazy man's Sandra Cisneros 
 Changing the canister (which you have to do once for every large room) is a messy undertaking.  Even if you're careful, dust and dirt slide out with the canister - dropping a mess onto the floor you just had to roll the Hoover WindTunnel over several times to get "clean."  What a waste of money 
 Barbara Branden is a former protege of Ayn Rand.  She is also (as the book amply demonstrates) a pretentious mediocrity who appears to be able to offer the world nothing substantive, save a vitriolic, snotty "tell-all" style blast against her former mentor and supposed "friend".        Barbara should have known that a book like this would be exactly the sort of thing Anti-Rand/Anti-Objectivism/Anti-Libertarian types would love -- a "juicy tell-all" purporting to demonstrate that one of the greatest public champions of socio-economic freedom was really just a shrewish, slutty nutcase.       Branden takes exquisite, almost tragically obvious care to paint herself as the wholly-innocent victim of the machinations of Nathaniel Branden (her husband at the time), and the supposedly megalomaniacal villian, Rand.  Her "sympathetic" portrayal of Rand's husband Frank O'Connor manages to show, instead, a pathetic, drunken schmuck, completely browbeaten and psychologically over-powered by his domineering shrew of a wife.      As with NB's retelling of events in "Judgment day", the Brandens portay themselves as the archtypal "innocent, impressionable teenagers destroyed by the vile, capitalistic evil-ness of Ayn Rand".  The truth is doubtless somewhat less flattering in their regard.       It's very ironic this book is taken at all seriously -- given that at least half of it is almost word-for-word reprint of a biographical sketch of Rand that Ms. Branden had published in the hard-to-find book "Who is Ayn Rand?" in 1968, shortly before the break.    No details of Rand's philosophy are given -- not even in summary form -- with the exception of several long-winded and preachy passages misquoting Rand's ideas, and then denouncing them as "dangerous".       To top it all off, after spending 200-plus pages painting Rand as a deceitful, power-mad poseur, Branden  devotes the end of the book to detailing the tremendous impact Rand's advocacy of socio-political freedom and "rational self-interest" have had on the culture at large.       All in all, this book is an obnoxious attempt by a former "friend" to urinate on a dead woman's grave.     I gave it 1 star, but it deserves far less. 
 Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews below before I bought this DVD.  It's a travesty of the DVD medium.  Perhaps Fox Lorber took the story of the movie too seriously:  they've produced a disk with the picture and sound quality of a bootlegged copy.  Don't waste your money on it 
 Beautiful book, enticing photos and the recipes, when they work, are excellent. This is not a book for beginning bakers, though. It requires some experience with home baking and patience because some of the quantities given are not exact and need a bit of adjusting and the essembly procedures need improvisation as well. Because many of the recipes are so involved, it takes some dexterity to reach the desired look and taste of the pastries. But when it works it is superb. I enjoyed the challenges, but buyers should beware. 
 Like some of the other reviewers have stated, the book suffers from poor editing and is definitely not user-friendly if you are new to FileMaker 8 - as a reasonably experienced FM6 user I struggled with get some of the examples working when going through it. The author also keeps assuming that you are using Filemaker Advanced when you are setting up the databases which can add to the confusion.  To hard for new users, too basic for advanced users and just plain confusing for those in the middle 
 This book is certainly one of the worst books I ever purchased. The information about the subject is completely irrelevant and   of cource misleading.The author Alan Dundes clearly states that  Vampyrism has nothing to do with Vlad Tepes!!! I literally had to tear this book apart when I got to know the real essence of it.If you're a fan of superstitions and scary stupid rumurs go for it,but if you are searching for truth don't even think about buying this book.I should have known it by even looking at the cover 
 The other reviewers will tell you about the book.  I've read most of Preston and Child's works, including the other two books in this trilogy, and they are a good read.  What gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism.  I guess it's a necessity to get published today, but you'd think that at least SOME male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published.  I guess most people will sell their souls for money.  Just about all the men in P and L's books are either wimps, effiminate, weak, bumbling, stupid (or liars or murderers), cry-babies, scared of their own shadows, and thoroughly unlikable (even Pendergast has his moments).  The women, of course, are, without exception, tough, brilliant, shrewd, fearless, always right, on the rise to the top, always outsmarting the men, able to knock out a 7 foot, 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck (forgive the slight hyperbole), totally unfeminine, and just as unlikeable as the men.  The stories are very good; it's unfortunate Preston and Child couldn't have come up with better, more realisticly human, less insulting characters.  This slop may play in New York and California, but in Texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women.  So this is just a warning.  If you're a MAN--and those of you who are know what I mean--you'll get sick of the characters in these books.  
 I read only half this book - that's where it should've logically ended.  It started off great, I loved the style but as I kept going on and on, the hilarity of two crack addicts and a cop who's fallen in love with his prime suspect in a quirky town in America lost it's flavor.  True, I should've finished it, but, well, don't take my word for it 
 I'm giving this movie two stars becuase McConaughey looks really good with his shirt off (one star) and it has Pacino and Russo (the other star).  After twenty five minutes, I decided I was wasting valuable time of my life watching this forgettable and worthless story. The end 
 Instead of writing a review I am citing an error that I observed in  reading the book.   On page 141, Mr. Davis states that Bob Marley had a  daughter named Kimane. He had a son named Kymani, who is now a singer and  recording artist 
 This is a very bad book. It is poorly written, the characters are caricatures in misery, and it is almost impossible to develop any empathy for them except for the older daughter, who suffers in silence after the devastating, and, to her, mysterious, death of her mother. Her father fails in both his calling to ministry and his responsiblities to protect his daughter. He is so distant that he believes what teachers tells him about his child's behavior, which is a perfectly legitimate childhood grief response, rather than the bad behavior that others choose to label her with indifference to her deep pain and confusion. He fails in his responsibilities to his parishoners by not realizing that he himself is mired in grief and needs a break. I couldn't finish this. It is drivel 
 I am a huge fan of the Series Of Unfortunate Events & found this book only slightly entertaining.  It in no way added anything to the series in any way.  If you have read the books & the Unauthorized biography then you have all the info you need to not waste your money on this book.  If you have not read the Unathorized Biography I would recomend spending you money on that first!  
 I grew up listening to her "In Concert" album, and bought the Pearl album based on reviews saying this was a more mature style for her music.  I like her old style better, this sounds like she was trying to make a more pop sound for her music (although the singing wasn't much different).  It not only didn't sound like what you expect from Janice Joplin, it sounded like a muzak imitation of her 
 Thinking that an expensive iron would last longer, I went ahead a spent the 80 some dollars back then. However, it stopped working after 16 months 
 I have read all of Kiyosaki's books and there are several that are outstanding.  I like Trump's earlier books better.  However, this book was just terrible if you have read anything by either of the two.  It is really a disappointment for the the two of them to collaborate on this one.  It appears they took excerpts from their other books and used cliches all over the place.  It was poorly written, offered little new advice or foresight, and was a major disappointment.  They spent too much time just talking about how they decided to write the book...Save your money for retirement and buy an earlier book of either of the two 
 I couldn't read the whole thing in order to know for sure. It was dry. I didn't get the imagery - I know it's supposed to be a classic, and I really wanted to read the book, I did - but it was long and boring and I just don't get why it's so "classicly popular". Sorry, but it's how I feel. Now, that being said, I read a condensed version of it, and I discovered the story was a little bit interesting - but that's as far as I can go, even with the condensed version - it was only "a little bit" interesting 
 People were talking about this movie as if it were the next Silence Of The Lambs.  There are several reasons why this is not so.  1. The Dumbest Cop In The World:  This character never calls for backup, and is too slow to think of the most obvious clues.  At the end, he even throws down his gun to have a fist fight.  He'd never survive on the Sopranos. 2. It's sooooooo 1998.  This movie assumes you know nothing about the internet.   3. It tries to be cool by combining BDSM, body modification, and rituals, but in the end it just makes all these things look bad. 4. It's inconsistent.  The Dee Snider character "retires" all his piercings for a few years, and then suddenly they're all back in the next scene.   5. It's unrealistic.  Where the heck did Snider get that second dungeon from in just a day? 6. I won't even get into the gaping plot holes.  The acting, pretty bad.  The dumbest cop in the world character has just one mood:  Grumpy.  Amy Smart is totally wasted in this movie.  Snider's pretty good though.  Actually he's really good.  Really, bottom line:  You have only two reasons to buy this movie. 1. You are easily entertained and you have no problem with plot holes so big you can drive a Twisted Sister tour bus through them with room to spare. 2. You're a Snider fan and you must own this.  If you belong to one of those two groups, go for it.  For Sister fans, they'll enjoy how the movie roughly follows the plot of the song Captain Howdy/Street Justice.    You've been warned!  
 I was disappointed with "Missing Men." I was expecting to find bits of insight, perhaps a pearl of wisdom here and there, something to connect with and relate to, being an artist, having been a single mother, having loved intensely, surely these were things that connections are made of....and yet I am left with the sensation of this being a fairly dry and remote recital of Johnson's family & relationship history.  I felt she was more of an impersonal narrator rather than intimately and emotionally involved with her story.  I finished the book wondering why Johnson had written it, what was her point, what did she want to convey to me with her memoirs?  What did I gain by reading it?  Nothing, I'm afraid.  I compare this with "Too Close to the Falls" by Catherine Gildiner... both set in New York, both describing their childhoods (well, I guess that's a prerequiste of a memoir, isn't it)... Johnson's book left me dutifully turning the pages to finish it, to get it over with... just the opposite of Gildiner's book, I hated to see it end.  Why did one bore me and another interest me?  I have no answer for that, perhaps it's entirely due to my psyche and has nothing to do with the authors.  But this is not something I'm adding to my recommended reading list 
 I have this raider helmet and I'd have to say the same thing as the last review.  I needed a helmet and went for a cheap one.  It felt like it.  If you aren't going to use it that much, then you can probably get away with it.  But I would go for an HJC or a shoei helmet.  I just purchased an HJC helmet and it feels so much better.  You get what you pay for 
 I gave this book a reading not too long ago. Nothing about this book is "controversial". It's the same manipulation of information that neo-nazis and the kkk use to put shame to folks of other races. Books like these have always existed, and their purpose is to make money from readers who think the message is "ground-breaking" or revealing of some deep knowledge that has always been hidden from the public. If you plan on picking up this book, be sure to pick up a confederate flag and a few skrewdriver albums to go with it, this book is equally brainless 
 Completey and utterly unfunny performances by Oldman and Roth. Stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not, having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen. We get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play. Watching the first fifteen minutes of "heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads," is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen. Having hopes it might pick up, that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever. A classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see. 
 Don't waste your money or time.  Definitely not worth it.  You can be standing right next to Hayley and it doesn't seem to find her.  My daughter tried it a couple of times and said she wants to return it 
 "Raw?"  "Energetic"?  "In your face"? I honstly can't understand how anybody could think the stuff on ISM is any of those things. Energy level is close to that of "The Trinity Sessions", but this band doesn't have the self-discipline - or the vocal & instrumental skills, for that matter - of the Cowboy Junkies, so they go on & on & on & on & on ... meandering dweebishly forever.   Capsule description - high-pitched personality-free vocals that are not IMHO improved by the very free application of reverberberberb, against a background of lethargic mush. Coming soon to garage sales all over the country 
 Reading this book was a total waste of time. I met the author recently. She asked if we thought any of the book was irrelevant...personally I thought the whole book was irrelevant 
 If you're in search of a magazine for women that actually has worthwhile content then move on. There is nothing of substance in Cosmopolitan. Open the latest issue and you will find "sex tips that will drive your man crazy!!!" and "snag that cutie!!" galore. It's pathetic. And sophomoric.  The sad thing is young women purchase magazines like this and want to emulate the fake lifestyles within that revolve around a) Looking for your "one true love" and by default B) How to achieve multiple orgasms with random sexual partners/boyfriends whilst on said search! And let's not forget inane question and answer spreads. Those are a hoot with such inquires as "my crack gets really itchy. What should I do?"  No, this magazine is not my bible.  This is another publication that deserves to be thrown into a furnace 
 I was incredibly surprised at how negative this book was about dissertation completion.  The last thing someone needs when starting out the process of writing a dissertation is reading about how many people never complete their work.  A how-to book should be encouraging not discouraging.  There are plenty of other books available that explain the process while leaving this authors cynicism at the door 
 A generation before there was a Left Behind, there was The Late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey and C. C. Carlson. This is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of America. A phemomenal best seller, it was a watershed event in the growing Christian publishing industry. For many Christians, their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future. A generation later, many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of Holy Scripture, sensationalistic attempts to correspond Biblical prophecies to current events, and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated.  So why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism? Well, while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events, it still resounds for much of the Church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by Lindsey and other "prophecy pundits." While it is certainly true that Tim LaHaye has replaced Lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism, it cannot be denied that Left Behind was made possible by this book.  Part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form. For LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, it was the pulp novel. Back in 1970, Lindsay and C. C. Carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic expose. Like most books of this type (e.g., The Bermuda Triangle, Chariots of the Gods?, The Philadelphia Experiment, The Population Bomb), it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts. Like most of these books, it was a peculiar period piece of American life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams. Like most of these books, it is laughable in retrospect.  If the book were out of circulation and I were reviewing this for historical purposes, I would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp. The original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong. After all, it was the 1970's when wild conspiracy theories, distrust of any traditional authority, and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage. When viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age, a UFO invasion, a famine around the corner, and California falling into the Pacific Ocean, the authors' claims of the coming Armageddon look downright trendy.  However, in the intervening years, the revisions of this book just kept piling up. Make a bad prediction? No problem, edit the book with the old gaffes removed, add a few trendier predictions, and release it as a new book. Lindsey, now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years, still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis (Carleton's contribution is more stylistic) despite his failed scenarios. Lindsey's original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s (he even wrote a book The 1980's: Countdown to Armageddon trumpeting this belief). Well that didn't pan out, so he then jumped on the Y2K bandwagon (another of his books was Planet Earth 2000 A.D.: Will Mankind Survive?). Oops, wrong again. First communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is Islam (a more recent book is The Everlasting Hatred: The Roots of Jihad). When one bogeyman falls, he is quick to insert a new one in its place.  Between the failed predictions, the hilarious misreadings of the original languages, the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology, and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the Biblical prophecies "right before our eyes", it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things. This trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs - notably the Left Behind series of novels.  If you can find a copy of the original version from 1970, it can be interesting in much the same way as a Brady Bunch episode - not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time. Just as many Catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the Baltimore Catechism, fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie A Thief in the Night.  However, for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy, it is best to pass. For all its success as a cultural marker, its usefulness in properly understanding Biblical prophecy is basically nil. For this, its original purpose, The Late Great Planet Earth is completely worthless.  
 This book was nothing but common sense that had almost nothing to do with a "second time" bride.  It talks about who pays, how to select a band, registering for gifts, and things like having a buffet or sit-down dinner.  It didn't give pros or cons or advice on anything, really.  Basically, it said to do whatever you want, just read the contract before signing on the dotted line.  It also stated that if you want to wear white, do it, and don't let anyone tell you can't.  This book was a waste of my time and very disappointing 
 Mr. De La Torre claims to teach the Ernest Jones method (which produced numerous national champions on both sides of the Atlantic) but then pollutes the Jones method by taking the hands out of the downswing.  After unsuccesfully trying Manuel's method for a while, I happened upon Arnie Frankel's Golf's One Motion video.  It is a much more straight forward presentation of the Jones method.  Understanding the Golf Swing misses the mark 
 Typically hysterical stand-up gets marred by novelty songs at the end. He begins the bit(s) at the end of the album by talking about how he's being pressured to release a novelty song to promote, but ends up spending way too much time with his take on them, including a full length song at the end. The crowd eats it up, but as per irony, that's the point - but it never should have been put on the album. Absolutely worth the purchase price for the first two-thirds of the album, though 
 As a long-time fan of Beverly Jenkins, Sexy/Dangerous was not her best work. This novel was missing the magic that has always accompanied Ms. Jenkin's stories. However, I will keep this in my collection. 
 You really hate to dislike a guy who lives life to the fullest and had to saw his arm off with an inch-long blade.  But for those with an eye to subtext, dislike is precisely what you'll find yourself experiencing not long into the second or third chapter.  Forgive me Aron, but you're kind of a d-bag.  Like many others, I found myself skipping forward with increasing speed past the uninteresting biographical excursions and self-flattering anecdotes, until I was full-bore just looking for the part where he cuts his arm off, desperate for some kind of stimulation.  Unfortunately, the payoff is lacking.    Most galling about this book, even more so than the autobiographical filler (one quickly gets the sense that Aron's wringing every drop out of his life in case he never gets to write another book), is the fact that the experience fails to even budge him out of his self-centered perspective.  I don't fault the guy for thriving in dangerous situations (I envy him), but it's clear that the only thing he took away from his plight was another testament to his status as The Greatest Most Important Person in the World.     By the time he's videotaped himself going through an insane laundry list of locations to scatter his ashes over, started barking orders to the rescuers who are doing everything they can to help him, and assured us several times by the end how right he was about everything all along, there's a good chance you won't have a shred of empathy for Aron left.  The man had to drink his own piss and yet didn't learn a thing about humility 
 This documentary had nothing new or interesting of use even to a newfound Manson fan. Really these guys who made the music doc should have gotten more interested in their subject or not even made it. To say this film is unauthorized or even thorough is letting it off the hook.     The sound and video was alright on the DVD even though the editing could've been better. The interludes to the different sections of the movie were okay at least. Video was a 4:3 ratio on the DVD and it wasn't region-coded. It was mixed okay in stereo sound so all of those parts are worth mentioning. However, interviews were directed poorly and without leading as much enthusiasm or controversy as there should have been. The soundtrack music by W!ck was awful and over the top. The producers never even glossed over the local scene that influenced the beginning of Marilyn Manson in Florida.     Interviews were directed poorly and without leading as much enthusiasm or controversy as there should have been. No one had anything new to say or exciting to say about the band. It was closer to an infomercial than a documentary. Much better interviews could have been used. Especially one's that were commonly on networks that were at least somewhat interesting and enlightenning. Why didn't they use interview footage from "Bowling for Columbine" when they used a still from it? The editor could have cut all the garbage with the fanboy. He was annoying and didn't say anything that was worth hearing about Marilyn Manson.      It's a shame the discography and videography sections of the DVD are so good. Couldn't the filmmakers have been as interested in what was behind the music of Marilyn Manson?     A really great documentary on Marilyn Manson is "Demystifying the Devil". The researcher should've taken sources from that movie 
 Buy this book if you want to listen to this guy beating his chest about how he got wealthy by being a marketing guru and squirelling his income away like Ebenezer Scrooge. He boasts about how he still works part time for fun to generate money he doesn't need. But apparently he doesn't think about donating this money he doesn't need to charity let alone giving his precious time to charity.   The really funny thing is, at the end of the book, he tells the reader not to buy brands and designer clothes but buy things only of real value. I agree with him. But he has just rubbished the entire marketing industry that he lauds in the first part of the book as a great place to make a highly paid career. It apparently does not occur to him that there is a big contradiction between the sales and marketing people who get paid megabucks for pumping products up beyond their real value and the truly skilled workers who create "real value" and get paid jack all. What a total cynic and hypocrite ! 
 Although the poems are beautiful... and I certainly don't mean to bash Whitman with this 2-star rating... it's the wrong book. NOT AS ADVERTISED. This was supposed to be the original 1855 edition. That's what I expected, and therefore (in my mind) what I was paying for. The original 1855 edition, according to modern literary analysis, was the "strongest/purest" version. It was the true starting point of Whitman's own (and consequently America's) poetic awakening. Consisting of just 12 "perfect" poems, it was THAT edition which Emerson praised so highly.  Whitman never put out another book... just revision after revision, addition after addition, and edition after edition of Leaves Of Grass... until you wind up with "the deathbed edition" which is a severely bloated and different work from the original.   I was very much looking forward to a slender volume of the original edition. Which is what the item description says this is. It's not. Be forewarned... it's the Deathbed Edition of 1892... nearly 500 pages. And frankly, there are MUCH better versions of the deathbed edition. Sturdier versions with nicer pages exist (this is a pretty weak paperback, printed on pulp pages), with better footnotes and more authoritive introductions. Shop around.   To sum up... the 2 star rating is because lying about which edition this is, is a terrible way to sell the book. Whitman was fantastic and the poetry contained in the book itself is first rate. It just would have been nice to get what I paid for. The "true" editon, written by a YOUNG Whitman at the height of his powers.. 
 As others have said, this is a neat concept, but in reality, it doesn't work that great.  After drawing on it, you wet a sponge to erase it.  Think about a small child wetting a sponge.  It ends up a dripping mess!  Then they end up with runny marker all over their hands, which ends up on their clothes, etc.  We're good about watching the kids, too.  You really have to take control of the sponge and make sure the board is wiped properly before the kids use it.  The other thing is that none of the colors glowed very well and the kids stopped using it after only a couple of days.  Just a very disappointing gift.  Fisher Price should have stuck with the original Doodle Pro... my kids have had it for a year and still use it 
 Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked 
     David Brame was a chief of police who committed at least one rape of a woman other than his wife--whom he raped repeatedly---and terrorized certain members of his department, mostly the women.  He harassed and tormented his wife.     This book could benefit from a little feminist perspective. In fact, it's not that shocking to find some cops are wife-beaters; it's a macho culture.  Nor is it shocking to find a chief of police beating his wife----to whom, after all, would she report him? His own department?  
 I think the author is ignorant about Ottoman World Wide State or he has some special idealism to write whole stupid things even though everything had been explained about This one of the biggest World Wide State in the history  and it is easy to see the reality that you need the quality to be the best in anything , since you were the best in the ancient time it is so disgusting that somebody like the author came out and vomit some gossips  I m sorry but I think so and I hope in the future Ottoman`s mission will be displayed with hono 
 I was given this CD from my sister, who knows I love to dig into up and coming bands.  I was not impressed.  The only song I found to be fairly original, in at least the sound, was In the Woods, which I wouldn't list as the fulcrum this album turns on.  The remainder of this album disappointed me with its appeal to emotion that was trying a little too hard (as is the style these days), hammering out repeated chords and vocals that have that familiar deep delicate sound.  Now, I don't like Coldplay.  I don't have any of their albums.  I hate to say this, but it almost sounds like Levy is really trying to pull off some Coldplay covers.  Make sure you listen to the samples before you buy this CD, because I'd hate for someone to accidently buy A Rush of Blood to the Head Part II. 
 Don't get me wrong: Jeph Loeb, chief writer on DC's terrific "Superman/Batman" series, has done outstanding work with these two players -- the rock solid foundation of the DC Universe ... but VENGEANCE -- by its bitter anticlimax -- feels very much like a conglomeration of ideas instead of one masterful story from start to finish.  Loeb begins with a Super-opening: Superman and Batman appear from a Boom Tube (don't ask, you've just gotta know what one is to really appreciate what happens here)and kill a superhero called Skyscraper who presumably murdered Lois Lane; incensed and out for vengeance, the Maximums -- this world's Justice League -- vow to hunt the Man of Steel and the World's Greatest Detective to the ends of whatever universe they inhabit in order to have their revenge ... and right there -- at least for me -- is where this story FELT like it wasn't going to be quite right: superheroes represent the best any world has to offer, and these Maximums want vengeance.  They want blood.  They want to kill Batman and Superman for taking one of their comrades away.  Honestly, right there, I was wondering if this was a tale for me.  Not too many pages later, I'm struggling to get through the mental and verbal gibberish of not only Bizarro but Batzarro, and I'm thinking, "Geez, Jeph Loeb really needs some time off."  VENGEANCE isn't a total loss.  Loeb's a great writer with a fantastic imagination and an uncanny ability to seal himself inside the minds of these two superheroes to show the reader what makes them tick, and only from his learned hands can you find so many wonderful moments in an otherwise forgettable story.  There's not only two worlds at play here; there are, quite possibly, dozens, as Supermen, Batmen, Supergirls, Batboys, and the like show up from earnest supporting appearances.  Granted, it may not make a whole lot of sense, but even THAT makes sense once you find out which dastardly villains are behind this whole world-hopping, mind-blowing affair.  Yes, it's worth a read, and, yes, it's arguably worth forgetting.  Remember the little moments along the way, and keep your fingers crossed for Loeb to appear in top form again real, real soon 
 This was my first experience with Stephen King and I made it to page 150 before I quit.  It was agonizingly slow and it just wasn't my cup of tea.  I told myself that I would quit at page 100 if it didn't seem to go somewhere but I gave it another 50 pages because it was Stephen King.  It was brutal 
 I heard the author on a local radio station and thought the book would be somewhat helpful or useful. It is not. Mostof it was jargon you have heard before and don't need to read. It was a complete waste of MONEY 
 I agree with inpip below, that this is an extremely dissatisfying and, in places, a factually inaccurate book. Nicole Kidman was never consulted by the biographers and all that she says or does in the book has been gleaned from articles in Vogue, Variety, etc. Being an admirer of Nicole's unsettling and haunting work in Eyes Wide Shut, The Others, The Hours, To Die For and The Portrait .., I was extremely disappointed to find that very little is said about the fact that she is, at the core, a thinking character actress and not really a garden-variety Hollywood star. This is what makes her art unusual and separates her from, say, Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan 
 In my usual perusal of the thrift shops for 25 cent novels, i came across this interesting find summer of 2005.  from the very first page, the book had me hooked. merricat blackwood is a girl i could relate to on first degree. in her family, she's a bit of a misfit, and as  a consequence, finds herself and her older sister constance locked away in their large old house as the town freaks after the *mysterious* death of their entire family at dinner on night.  everyone hates them and wants them gone. merricat braves walking to town to buy groceries for her sister with cash from the vast amount of wealth they keep hidden in the house. the towns people sneer at merricat and ask her to leave and she, head lifted, tries bravely to remain unafraid.  it is an all together marvelous book for anyone who enjoys the cryptic events that go on behind the scenes of creepy old houses.  
 I was expecting to read a book about the Amish. What I read instead was a very self centered book about a woman searching, rather blindly, I felt, for herself.   She had very little in the way of insight into Amish life, even after spending a period of time with them. And her inability to get outside of her own head/her own life was not terribly interesting to read.  For someone who always longed to be a 'star,' I am sure publishing a book was quite a thrill for her. Shame she used the Amish as a platform for her own ego 
 I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was PG that it would be fine.  Also, the market for Transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere.  Wow, were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie.  These were not just words like shoot or dang, but the real deal.  I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons.  I am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking.  Who knows what the rating will end up being for the upcoming movie at the box office.   Concerned in Alabam 
 Travels in the Scriptorium is Paul Auster's (mercifully short) 13th novel ... or is it?  Sadly, Mr. Auster hasn't had a new idea since Leviathan; each novel he's written since then has been nothing more than a repackaging of his old ideas (chance, alienation, identity).  I've read all of his novels and, with the exception of the horrible In the Country of Last Things, regard his early ones as exceptional, and they meant a lot to me; that's why reading the latter half of his oeuvre has been so disappointing, and frustrating.    Between the age of 50 and 60, a career (and acclaimed) novelist should be in his prime, but Mr. Auster has not fulfilled his promise.  Instead we have Mr. Blank, the protagonist in his latest novel(?), which reads more like, I hope, his confession that he knows he is out of ideas.  The novel reads as if Mr. Auster himself is in his old age, in the grip of dementia:  the shards of his former writings and influences are haunting his soul, and he's decided to scrawl it all down and pass it off as a novel.  So in Travels we get a stifling pastiche of Kafka and Beckett peopled with ghosts of characters from Mr. Auster's other novels, plus the distasteful details of Mr. Blank's member and his bowel movements.    The limited action contained within this slim book's covers are detailed in the product description and don't need to be restated here.  If you've never read a novel by Mr. Auster before, this isn't the one to start with:  read the NY3, Moon Palace, The Music of Chance, or Leviathan.  If you've read Mr. Auster's other novels, you have read Travels in the Scriptorium already.  
 It doesn't zap the yap of our newly adopted Pomeranian mix.  Although we have seen her jump once or twice and it appeared to be the zap that did it, but it didn't slow her down much.  We did everything according to directions, and even shaved a spot on her neck to help make better contact.  We have used the shock trainer collar on our mastiff mix and it worked extremely well.  I'm disappointed with this bark collar though 
 Some people praise `We Don't Live Here Any More" as one of the realistic portrayals of two married couples, tired of lies, not really knowing what to do. It is also true that Naomi Watts and Mark Ruffalo have exceptional talent and here again they would not disappoint you with their fine acting. The film as a result looks like a filmed version of some John Updike novels (actually it is based on two shorts by Andre Dubus, whose `Killings' became `In the Bedroom').  But sorry, Updike is not my favorite author, and the film's touch is too desultory for me. No, `desultory' is not the only real problem because I remember I was fascinated by the desultory realism of much more successful `In the Bedroom.' The real flaw of `We Don't Live Here Any More' is its dullness and all too familiar things about the four principal characters.   Mark Ruffalo's character Jack is having affair with Naomi Watt's Edith and Jack's wife (Laura Dern) already suspects, or knows that his husband is cheating. But the affair means here uninspired, clichéd sex scenes between Edith and Jack among the woods in Oregon, with Naomi Watts and Mark Ruffalo having sex against a tree ala `Fatal Attraction.' Edith husband Hank (Peter Krause) teaches creative writing, and has just one book published. The alcoholism of Laura Dern's character is suggested in the most obvious way (you know what), but in the first place why didn't the filmmakers realize that her portrait as poor housekeeper with alcoholism is already a big cliché?  Among these recycled materials, there are a few well-observed descriptions that deserve attention. It is the brief, but efficient study of the children in both families, and the film shows how these children accept the reality of the marriage that is falling apart. These clever, insightful moments, however, do not last long in the film, for it soon returns to the typical representation of the domestic life in America.   We don't want any big surprises, or twists and turns in this kind of film because we know we have none from the beginning. It is true that `We Don't Live Here Any More' presents a convincing portrait of boring and stagnant marriage in a slumbering small town in America, but the film goes nowhere from there, missing every chance for the more incisive study of the characters. 
 I was appalled at the lack of editing, the poor grammar and the number of typos in this book.  Perhaps others could overlook it.  I was constantly distracted and therefore found it difficult to muster any respect for the author.  In addition, I felt that it was written for a rather uneducated audience, for folks who couldn't analyze and think for themselves.  The conversations of the characters were overstated.  In general, the concept of the book was ok, not spectacular, but the format was undigestible 
 I love dance music, techno music, remixed music, and Christmas music, but I cannot love this album.  Everytime I find a "remixed christmas" cd, I usually get it, just because I'm hoping someday there will be one that actually transforms traditional holiday songs into club anthems.  Unforntuanately, all of them have the same trend.  They sound like 4th graders having fun with a computer.  This one, as foul as it is, is actually better than most, however.  There Are a few songs that aren't bad, Hark The Harold Angels Sing isn't exactly regrooved, but it's nicely mixed. White Christmas has good usage of vocals and beats. The rest however . . . well, Carol of the Bells, for instance, sounds like someone banging pots and pans to the music of a very, VERY slow paced funeral march.  It is so bad.  There are Dj scribble sounds, a demoic voice that whispers "Christmas", whoosey moans like a smurf taking a crap. It's horrid.  If you don't believe me, listen to the samples, they won't lie to you 
 The book does a good job in illustrating why the little things we do is important in creating return sales but it does not dive into the world of industrial sales.  The customer of this book is most often the retail consumer.  The world of customer loyalty in industrial relationships is motivated by different needs and not addressed by this book 
 This was the first book by Danielle Steele that I have read and it will be the last I read by her. I was truly disappointed and believe she is a highly over-rated author. The story was VERY drawn out and I caught myself dozing off a few times because the book was so boring. If you want to fall asleep quick then this is the book for yo 
 This novel started out pretty good in that I didn't know where Koontz was going with Martie's panic attacks and fear of herself.  It seemed to take FOREVER for anything to actually happen. The antagonist was a caricature.  So over-the-top, it was a job getting through each page. If this had been my first Koontz novel, I probably wouldn't bother with a second.

 This book functions primarily as a large advertisement for the author's seminars/classes. Most of what the book presents is naive, simplistic or just plain wrong. The financial side techniques presented include "tried and true" goodies that don't work now and didn't work when I first read them in a book my dad bought 40 years ago.   The negotiating tactics don't work. See Spin Selling for some of the best sales and negotiating material out there.   Of course, if you are able to deal only with people who are completely ignorant of the real estate values in their town and who distrust lawyers, i.e., don't have contracts reviewed in lieu of using a real estate broker, you may get some of these gems to work for you.  And what do I know? Not much -- but I have appeared in court as an expert appraisal witness, made a few million in real estate (& yes, I still read books. Who knows when I'll find a good idea?) and been a real estate broker for 30 years.  The author, if he ever made any money in real estate, is now, it would seem, making his money selling his seminars. Run, don't walk, away from the author and his materials. 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items)

 This book was easy enough to read, it just wasn't what I expected from Quindlen.  I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.  The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.  Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.  The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young "sew-your-wild-oats" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the "perfect" father. I just did not find such an occurrence likely.  And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm. Anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me, and a disappointment especially since I have been a Quindlen fan for many, many years 
 I Just bought a one anf tried in sacramento area.       The sound quality is really bad. I tried all channels and tried to reduce the volume too. You can't enjoy the music coming through this gadget, quality of sound is  not good at all 
 I enjoy reading books of trivia and fun facts, but I didn't even make it through the first chapter before I put this book down in disgust. Almost every entry had to do with sex or male endowments. As I was flipping through the book, I found x-rated pictures and drawings that I would hate to have to explain to my children if they were to pick up this book. I never would have bought this book if I had seen it in a bookstore, and I regret throwing it in the trash before I could see if I could get my money back 
 I moved to Central California in the late 1990s and was particularly curious about the history of the latter half of the 20th century; i.e., the names and events that are still regularly tossed around as common knowledge by local commentators.  Surprisingly, there are very few books giving a broad overview of California history and current events during this period.  "Paradise Lost" happens to be one of these few books.  Politically, I believe that I am largely in agreement with Schrag (that California built world-class infrastructure during the 1960s, and, because of the "tax revolt" of 1978 and subsequent political in-fighting, has allowed it to deteriorate to third-world status).  However, as a practical matter, this book seems like 368 pages of quick dash-off.  Since Schrag is a newspaper editor by training, his long, rambling, run-on sentences are surprising as well as frustrating to read.    The book was of some value in familiarizing me with California's recent history/current events, but it is so poorly written and organized that it does a disservice both Schrag's thesis and his readers 
 This album is waaay too deep and self-indulgent for my taste. Being a huge Alan Parsons Fan, it pains me to have to say this, but this was almost a total waste of vinyl, energy and money 
 I bought this book hoping for a Christian perspective on the Christian-themed The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown.  What I paid for is unabashed preaching on how the Gospel can be spread through never re-interpretting or revisiting the collection of stories called the Bible.    These two theological scholars don't add any additional light to Brown's story nor do they actually show proof that the DaVinci Code couldn't have been true (which, in fact, I agree that most of Brown's work is fictional interpretation.)   It seems like another opportunity for Christians to talk to themselves and reinforce a narrow viewpoint through villianizing the "mass media" and the general population.  Pure back-patting fluff 
 These can be had for $59-$69 a case elsewhere. Shop around, this vendor is overpriced. 
 I read the reviews and believed them.  When I read the book to my 2 1/2 year old, I felt weird.  First of all, the mother has a habit of 'crawling' across the bedroom floor to get to her son in the middle of the night while he's sleeping--as a baby that's fine, but when he's a grown man?  And, to be rocking a grown man in his sleep???  And then, the son, now a grown man, rocks his aged mother in his arms as well.  I can't do justice to how creepy I found the book.  After reading it, my son pleaded with me not to read it anymore and said he found the mother in the book "SCARY!"  So, I'm returning my book and the extra copy I had gotten, thinking I would keep it and give it as a gift 
 When I first learned about this book, I was more than excited that someone had finally written book about high school hockey. I had already read the great accounts of high school sports in Friday Night Lights, and In These Girls, Hope Is A Muscle. Thirty pages into the book, I was more than impressed with the author's beautiful descriptions of Methuen, hockey, and his growing up in this area of New England.  Suddenly, things began to change, as I was now embedded in the author's autobiography of his past hockey and athletic exploits! He makes a very clear statement in the beginning that he doesn't want to be back in his high school years, but simply remember them. Oh, he does remember everthing and anything, and certainly lets the reader know of his dauntless exploits. Who really cares how many goals he scored on a frozen pond playing against a bunch of kids, or popping in nine goals in a pickup game with a senior group pretty much out of shape, or being one of the three stars in the annual JV intersquad scrimmage! Give me a break.   Atkinson managed to work his way into his old high school with the pretense of collecting background for his book. What he did was to live vicariously through this new Ranger team and maybe better his own team record of 5-15-1. He committed the inexcusable error of a writer; allowing your own life to intermingle and become part of what you were trying to write about.  As for the team, too bad Atkinson created an almost Neanderthal mentality and impression of these boys. The naive reader might think this is what hockey is all about, but what a terrible injustice to a group of athletes. As for the coaches, between the locker room expletives, bench outbursts during games, and the pre-game talks about "mating sperm whales" with your female goalie standing in the doorway, I feel this is a reasonable estimate of inappropiate juvenile behavior and thinking with some of the Methuen coaching staff.   At the end, as I struggled to finish his "memoirs," I had to laugh at his mention that he didn't feel quite the same and welcomed going back to Methuen High School after his year. They were probably happy he was finally gone. Typical of "volunteer" coaches or staff, their impression of what they are doing and accomplishing is usually far from reality. The author may have felt he was imparting "words of wisdom," and valuable pieces of experience to members of the team, but Mr. Bobb you really missed the target here. A sixteen, seventeen year-old boy barely hears the words of his parents, much less his teachers, and certainly nothing from a 42 year-old "want-to-be."  If you know anything about high school sports, and/or hockey, save yourself from this self-indulging book. Oh, by the way, why can I be so critical? I have just finished my 34th season coaching high school hockey, ninety-percent of it as a head varsity coach. Along with this, twenty-five years as a head varsity coach in two female sports, and thirty-six years as a high school classroom teacher have all allowed me to see just about everything. In my career, the players and teams of the past are in the books. Next season, all the pages start to be written again. 
 This is an exemplary example of NOT judging a book by it's cover. The back of the book insist this is "a hilarious and chilling.......playground for the rich, ...brilliantly suspenseful.."ad nauseum. First I couldn't keep the characters straight because one of the protagonists was a detective named Lynn Cutter. I thought it was a female, which threw me really off track when MR. Cutter gives private investigator Breda Burrows a long look at her blue eyes and long legs. MR. Cutter is a policeman, but one who is hoping he will get into no more trouble until his pension comes through in a matter of months. Along stumbles (literally) Ms. Breda Burrows, a strong woman, but desperately in need of someone with a badge to help her solve the mystery of a rich woman who believes her husband is philandering by giving sperm to a sperm bank.  My sympathies and sense of humor lie with Mr. Cutter, who is really a very funny character and brings life into this incredibly boring story. As Breda's guide they must wander through the glazed world of Palm Springs, where they will encounter oddities that don't fit, bodies that shouldn't be dead and loads of money. This book is not captivating enough, even with Mr. Cutter as a lively character to warrant one star

 Some say the arguments against Afrocentrism formally opened with the publication of Dinesh D'Souza's Illiberal Education in 1991. Now a professor at Stanford, D'Souza was a young conservative journalist at the American Enterprise Institute, a D.C. located public-policy right-wing self-proclaimed "think-tank". No wonder D'Souza spends a chapter of the text ("In Search of Black Pharaohs: The Roots of Protest at Howard")  having the gall to seethe at the intellectual activities of Howard University, the breeding ground for Eric Williams' Capitalism and Slavery among other brilliant publications. D'Souza complains that the modern American university, in the name of diversity and multiculturalism, has stifled debate and intimidated larger society into accepting new canons. These canons are essentially race and gender-based propositions that one must accept or risk being ostracized as sexist or racist.  Illiberal Education opens by describing the ideal university campus: a place that is "serene and opulent", with students "[moving] in small groups", Ivy Leagues "[giving] off a distinct aroma of old money and tradition."  He then launches into a criticism of campus protest, trivializing the University of Michigan race-scandals of the early 1990's, whittling the whole episode down to [...] and blacks demanding the chance to make punching bags out of inoffensive white male students. He pours sympathy on poor Robert Gallagher, a Princeton University professor who opposed Women's Studies in the 1980's. D'Souza argues that Western thought has historically been self-criticising (i.e. Marxism is a criticism of Western bourgeois culture that sprung specifically from Western bourgeois culture) and that the teaching method of the typical liberal curricula pre-Afrocentrism and gender-focused studies was disputation, not indoctrination.  Forgetting that racism and sexism are still weighty social realities for many Americans and that all Americans are victims of both sexism and racism, Illiberal Education concludes that recent gender and ethnic studies programs are unfortunately based on unnecessary indoctrinationist principles. The book does not analyse anything written at the Howard University Press closely. D'Souza argues vehemently against affirmative action programs, multiculturalism, left-wing academia in all its packages, and `political correctness'. Excerpts from his book have appeared in stories in New Republic and Forbes Magazine. Also, more than two dozen major newspapers and magazines have reviewed Illiberal Education. In promoting his publication, Dinesh D'Souza spoke at numerous colleges and universities, followed by a 20-city media tour and appearances on such network talk and news shows as Good Morning America and Nightline. Instead of bemoaning separatist activities of Afrocentric groups, D'Souza asks, in the front flap of his book Letters To A Young Conservative, "Are you tired of the liberal agenda that dominates so many aspects of American life?" without recognising that America is largely a puritan state. His book What's So Great About America has a chapter called "Two Cheers for Colonialism" and another called "The Reparations Fallacy: What African-Americans Owe America." He idolises Ronald Reagan, the man who opposed both the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Housing Act of 1970 and called the Voting Rights Act of 1965 "humiliating to the South".  Nonsense!! 
  I have given Skinner's book I star, because it was required to write a review. I consider its ideas dangerous - for the simple reason that it represents a frontal assault upon our ideas of freedom and human dignity.    　Of course, Skinner doesn't see anything 'sinister' in his ideas. He simply takes it for granted that our notion that we have 'interior selves' and are autonomous (i.e. free agents) - is largely an illusion. In short, Skinner's argument (and it just that, not a statement of fact, as he would have us believe) - is that we are wholly determined in our lives by environmental factors, which is to say - 'conditioned' by forces outside ourselves.    Skinner's argument, then, is that we might as well accept this and make the most of it. Rather than resisting the idea of conditioning, he thinks we should perfect it. In short, if there is nothing more than external conditioning and learned behaviour, then we might as well have social scientists maximising our potential to live with the learned behaviour.    The fallacy of Skinner's argument, is that the notion of human freedom and dignity rests upon scientifically 'unprovable' or 'unverifiable' assertions. When we look, we cannot find a 'ghost in the machine' - and thus, we might as well accept the machine. But it is a facile argument. The fact that we cannot reduce our interior selves to a scientifically quantifiable formula, is the very reason why it remains of vital importance to human life. Its resistence to reductive, strictly empirical formulas, is what makes human nature special. Nobody sensible would deny that childhood experience is highly formative, or that certain genetic determinants are at work, or that empirically speaking, we are conditioned in our external lives. But we have no reason to suppose that these factors are ALL determining.    Needless to say, Skinner's thinking was informed by wholly secular ideas of social and scientific progress - much as if we could get behind everything and 'push.' Paradoxically, Skinner never gave that much thought to who controls the controllers! Skinner wasn't thinking of anything like Soviet style dialectical materialism - but, if we wanted a graphic example of how things go painfully wrong by regimenting human nature and trying to educate people out of the idea that they have 'interior selves' - well, the failures of the Soviet Union (or Communist China) tell us all we need to know.    I don't say this with any illusions that captalism and 'free markets' per se, are intrinsically more respectful of human freedom and dignity. Those values hinge upon something deeper, and without that, there is little to prevent a 'market oriented' society drifting into social controls and abuses of human nature, no less than those which drove the Soviet system.      Ironically, some reviewers have adduced Buddhist teachings(i.e. the doctrine of anatman = no-self) as further confirmation of Skinner's ideas. But Buddhism only denies that there is a permanent self in the skandhas or aggregates - a materialistic self. In fact, the Buddha taught people to take refuge in the 'self' and the Dharma as an inner lamp. Buddhists do have 'interior' lives. Moreover, the Buddha accorded 'dignity' to human nature, or manusya- as the 'most noble of two footed beings.'    It is not anyone else's business to define what we are - in any final or absolute sense. Those who would endeavour to do so are of the same mind as those who would patent the human genome,and plan on engineering an improved version of the human race in their laboratories. The chances are that those who would play 'God' will end up doing the devil (or Mara's) work. As the Rolling Stones song said: - "Hey - you! Get offa maa cloud! "  
 Disappointing.  Looks like she was trying to wrap up the trilogy without putting too much effort into it.  It lacked much of the depth and richness of her previous books 
 Some of the medical information is very helpful.  My recommendation is that this is not a book for someone under 35, it is not a book for someone who has already had a hysterectomy, nor is it for someone who has young children at home.  Her hormonal theory, that menopause is the time in life when we look beyond nurturing our families, and look to nurturing ourselves instead is slightly flawed.  Many women have hysterectomies or other forms of induced menopause at a very early age.  Do I think that my total hysterectomy at 34 (and the obvious onset of menopause) changed my ability or desire to nurture my children?  Of course not.  That's ridiculous, and if I think about it too much, it's actually offensive.  Her comments about marriage are questionable, as well.  Marriages sustain many changes, and menopause is just one of them.  Open lines of communication, deep love and commitment are certainly enough to weather the "hormonal storm."  How sad that it seems as if one point of the book is that menopause is the time to assess your marriage.  Shouldn't we be doing that every day, and re-committing ourselves to growing together?    Many reviewers have commented on some of her more non-traditional methods.  I am not a fan of tarot cards, and I'm not sure how I feel about taking medical advice from someone who diagnosed herself on several occassions, by using them.  That's just my own opinion.  I tried to look beyond that.  I just think this is another book written for people older than I am.  That's okay, but it still leaves me looking for something I can truly relate to 
 I opened this book very neutrally--I had never heard anything about Susan Sontag except her name, in a preface to an Annie Leibovitz book.  I still can't believe some of the things I read.  Sontag mentions in the foreword that she has an "obsession" with photography.  I would argue that she has an obsession with resenting photography. She begins by comparing a camera to a gun and the act of taking a picture to rape.  To a certain point, I can understand this--being photographed is a very self-conscious experience.  But somehow, I think rape victims would laugh at this comparision.  Self-consciousness is not exactly rape.  Also, she seems to believe that all photography is taken completely without the consent of the subject(s); they are innocent victims being raped by guns.  The last time I checked, most of the photographers she mentions (Diane Arbus, Richard Avedon, Edward Weston, Julia Margaret Cameron) took pictures only with express permission, and many (Eugene Atget, Ansel Adams, etc.) did not take pictures of people at all.  Almost all good pictures, with the exception of Henri Cartier-Bresson type photography, requires tacit consent between photographer and subject.   Sontag's resentment seems to come mostly from the resentment generated by photography's replacement of writing in description.  Specifically, she says that whereas photograpy "steals" the pain of others, writing uses only one's own pain.  This is funny, since I remember reading about how Jane Austen's neighbors complained because their lives were being stolen for her books.  Ever since the art of storytelling began writers and storytellers have been "stealing" other people's lives, their pain, etc.  Fitzgerald used Zelda's insanity just as David Bailey photographed Marie Helvin.  I believe that the art of writing and the art of photography are incredibly similar, and Sontag sounds very sour grapes.  How is Strand's photographing the famous "Blind Woman" different from Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood?" My biggest objection to Sontag, however, is her lack of either proof or explanation.  She simply states opinions as if they were facts, and then stops.  For example, according to Sontag, Weston is now regarded as antiquated and cliche.  Really?  Somehow I thought, considering the worth of his work, his exhibitions in museums, and the wealth of books devoted to him, as well as his inclusion in every basic photography class, that he was still very highly regarded.  I'm sure that Sontag regards him as antiquated and cliche, but this is very different from the "everyone" she generally to be present and in full agreement with her. Sontag also concentrates exclusively on one genre and attacks photography as a whole through that genre.  Diane Arbus's photos are apparently taking horrible advantage of everyone pictured in them, and are freakish visions of a bleak world--therefore all photographs in the world are taking horrible advantage and are freakish visions of a bleak world.  I can understand why some people find Arbus's photos terribly offensive, but I think only the extremely deluded would use her as representative of all photography. One last aspect of Sontag's book, which I found the most offensive, is her assumption that a picture is stealing the pain of others and, in a sense, profiting from it artistically.  This is despite her inclusion in her "Anthology of Quotations" of Richard Avedon's interview where he stated that the pictures he took of other people were more about him than about them.  Everyone who has ever practiced photography with any passion can testify to the truth of this statement, hence my conclusion that Sontag has probably never really picked up a camera.  Look at Avedon's pictures of a tortured Marilyn Monroe, and then read Arthur Miller's "After the Fall," which describes a tortured and pill-popping Marilyn Monroe.  There is very little difference, except that in Avedon's pictures Monroe still retains some amount of dignity, whereas in Miller's play she becomes a demon of hysteria and cruelty.  In the end, although I am both a photographer and a writer, I would say that writing has ten times the power of misrepresentation and "stealing the pain of others" than does photography 
 Just another book explaining Christianity to Christians using an easier to comprehend analogy than those contradictary fables in the new testament.  The title should be changed to "A Christian Introduction into how Christians misunderstand non-Christian worldviews 
 Thankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta.  Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie.  Besides, this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it.    As usual, Uma's acting is simply dreadful. I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad.  How she became a "star" in Hollywood is beyond me.  She is not attractive nor can she act.  She could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn't have changed the movie one bit.  I think when they need an actress who doesn't mind playing drivel roles, they call her. John Travolta is not much better.  His version of "cool" just doesn't do it for me. His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak.  And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so.    The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn.  Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie.  I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping.  While I fast forwarded through Uma and Travolta's scenes, I tended to rewind during Rock's and Vaughn's scenes; they were so funny I had to see them again.  Cedric the Entertainer was also pretty good.    
 I love Pop/Rock so I wanted this CD after hearing the first single "4EVER".  Too bad nothing else on this CD is worth listening too.  The vocals are annoying and the lyrics are even more annoying.  I would not wish this much pain on anyone.  Nothing is very catchy.  I found myself getting irritated because of the whiny voices.  Stay away from this debut with no kick 
 This book completely leaves out their political writings.  If you want to learn about their artistic beliefs it's a good book, but it has none of their (important) political writings.  
 I have the third edition as published in 1997, at a much higher price than the current book. This book was useless even in 1997.   The author believes in accreting, not revising. So chapter 13 was entitled "New Developments 1995", and chapter 31 entitled "New Developments: 1996 and Early 1997". In between is a disorganized hodgepdge of articles about software, medical devices, foreign filings, and so on. The style of writing is discursive, with almost no diagrams (only one chapter out of 31 has any diagrams at all) and no summaries or bullet point lists to help a busy patent practitioner.   The material itself generally is (i) outdated, (ii) well-known to patent attorneys, and/or (iii) too disorganized and episodic to give a layperson any useful understanding of patent strategy.  I strongly suspect that the glowing reviews elsewhere on this page are written by the author's friends and family, if not the author himself. When I move to a new office a few weeks from now, this book will be heading off my bookshelf and deep into my garage -- if it's lucky.  
 I wish I read the reviews before I bought this thing, unfortunately.  Extremely user unfriendly to connect and disconnects itself often; kills batteries even in sleep mode.    The size and precision is good when it does work, but definitely not worth the money.  I exchanged it for a new one thinking it was just the first unit, but still terrible 
 While I found the reviews to be accurate, this book does not have a whole lot of selections compared to other books like Lonley Planet. 
 I found History of the Balkans very flat as I have a interest in former Yugoslavia.Mr Glenny pasted over English created problems ie:Blieburg, he would have you believe happened as a Partisan only action against Women ,Children & Ustashe members.He should cover one Country rather than try cram the whole region into one book 
 Although the illustrations are lovely and we both love unicorns, the story was just not good.  It was also too descriptive in places for the age range listed.  The story is about mankind destroying the forests and a lot of dialogue between the unicorn and the little girl.  It was really just plain boring 
 Nicky Cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment, as he turns  in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi 
 My first Grisham novel, and it reminded me of why I seldom read fiction.  The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility.  Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion.  Absurd!  No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing!  The "storybook ending"just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy.  Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases.  Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago.  Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall.  First Grisham = LAST Grisham 
 Littel has written a book about undercover agents that assume identities and personalities, called "Legends". The premise behind the book, and this may be kind of vague because I read the book several months ago, is that one of these undercover agents (or former agents?) is seemingly struggling with a personality disorder that obscures his reality. Not only does the character seem to have issues with reality, but the reader is left guessing as to the certainty of many of the vingnettes that are loosly slapped together in this plodding, oftentimes aimless read.   The story is not very gripping or believable. There are flash-in-the-pan moments where the author paints a comical scene in what reminds me of the incredulous, but believable style of Tom Robbins. On the other hand, the book tries desperately to take on this Tom Clancy seriousness that is totally unbelievable in view of its outrageous episodes.   Perhaps I would have enjoyed  "Legends" had I read it more carefully. I read the book for pleasure and escape from a life of reading impossibly dull legal tomes. So mabye, had I approached the book with greater diligence and less expectations, it is possible that I would have enjoyed it. 
 Danielewski is a little like "musician" Puff Daddy: he really does very little work on his own but is an expert at appropriating ideas from the avant-garde and then rearranging them in a comfortable, easily consumable form. "House of Leaves" has more in common with Stephen King than it does with Ballard, Burroughs, Poe, or even more radical artists who use the methods MD steals, like Samuel R. Delaney.  If having to turn a book while you read seems "cutting edge" or "daring" to you, then jump in. Otherwise, you should go buy some Jeff Vandermeer of China Mieville -- two artists less concerned with empty stylistic tricks and more focused on producing quality literature 
 I couldn't get past the effort at clever jokes, witty remarks, and cute made-up phrases in this book on every single page. Tidbits of information clutter every page is a truly random fashion. Not only that, the real information is hidden somewhere in between. Also, is is really a topic that warrants such a thick and complicated book? 
 I found this book through a newspaper review and eagerly bought it. I was very disappointed. It is overly academic, dull, poorly organized and excessively wordy. As a journalist, I understand the powers of brevity and clarity, but the author does not. Even the organization, by month, leaves a lot to be desired as the author still skips between months. The political background becomes so laborious that it is impossible to follow a chain of events or personalities. I would definitely skip reading this book, even though I forced my way through all of it, hoping that it would get better. It did not 
 Self-Appointed beer expert Jackson churns out more amateur fluff in this shallow study.  Hardly ultimate and hardly scholarship - at least not on the level of Gunderson, Klein, or Passel.  Very disappointing to true  established experts 
 This book was a required text, otherwise I never would have read it.  The book is full of inconstancies, bad literary technique, and it takes to many pages to cover not enough material.  The authors personal prejudices are obvious.  There are better books on teamwork available 
 This is by far the worst dance movie I have ever watched. The characters, acting and plot lines are laughable (even for someone who usually loves cheesy dance movies) and what little dancing there is in the film is badly filmed and boring.  If it hadn't been for the hilarious 80's outfits and hairdos (especially the curly mullet sported by the lead character), I would have turned it off. If you like salsa, watch 'Dance With Me' 
 I used this book as an undergrad in a graduate course and our assignments consisted of discovering all of the errors and attempting to correct them.  It is a good reference book for name reactions, but as far as stereochemistry is concerned be VERY CAREFUL! 
 There seemed to be no beginning or middle.  No idea if there was an end because I couldn't finish it.  I kept nodding off until one of those "cybernotes" numbers popped up, the ones us gentle readers were superciliously instructed to download early in the book, or have "a friend" download them if we didn't have internet access nor particularly cared.  I got no real sense of time and place despite all the references to clothing, food and what came over Mr. Kane's short-wave.  There was little real content and way too many bloated words. I couldn't like any of the characters at all-- the ones that had any development.  Ruby LaPointe is a self-centered, vain whiner and Jean-Luc is an insufferable know-it-all stuck parenting her.  Anne-Marie barely exists unless she's taking tap-dance lessons or Ruby gets aggravated at her for having the nerve to be sleepy at midnight because Ruby just had to drag the kids to a "dish night" movie on a school night.  Does Anne-Marie even go to school and if so, where?  I probably missed that somewhere in the cloud of bloated words that showed me little.  I glanced at the cybernotes.  I don't recommend reading them unless you want to be textually condescended to and don't mind multiple spelling errors (H.L. Menkin and the Barring Land Bridge?) 
 	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a story of love and compassion, which takes place during the beginnings of the French Revolution. Despite the fact that many aspects of the revolution are portrayed well in the novel, the book is still a tiring read and requires a strong liking for Dickens' writing style.  	Throughout the novel, Dickens bogs the story down with excessive descriptions and meaningless scenes. The language is relatively simple and easy to comprehend, but the extra descriptions make the novel difficult to fully understand. Most of the characters in the novel are completely unrealistic, which makes it difficult for the reader to relate to what is going on. The character of Lucie Manette, is portrayed as the perfect women with absolutely no flaws. Her character is the supposed epitome for women, but in truth, is highly improbable. Throughout the novel, Dickens' does a great job at keeping the story dry and unentertaining, giving little to no excitement to cause the reader to want to continue. Despite these countless imperfections, Dickens' does manage to be partially successful in his quest to portray the revolution.  	The book, with all its shortcomings, did reveal to the reader, the atrocities that occurred during the French Revolution, and the events that led to it. The abuse of the nobles, and the radical ideas of the revolutionists are all shown in many parts of the novel. The one other aspect that Dickens got right in his novel was the character of Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton is the only character in the story that many readers can relate too and understand a variation of what Carton feels. Carton is a lawyer who feels that everything he has done in his life has been wrong and believes that he can do no good in life. This characteristic is common among people, and Dickens manages to capture that aspect of humanity precisely.   	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, is a slow moving book with numerous flaws that cause the reader to lose interest fairly often. Dickens' overuse of description and unrealistic characters add to the book's dryness. However, Dickens does capture a time in history with great accuracy. This is a book for a reader who likes Dickens' overzealous descriptions and enjoys slow moving stories. 
 Extremely dry to watch not really humorus unless you are into very dry humor and I do not think kids are... I bought because I did not know about this video before hand it was in the family kids section in the Borders Book Store. I cannot take it back so what to do with it...UGH! I guess another unused dust collector on my video rack... We decided it was for adults... but then my adult daughter said she did not like it so I guess it is better to know what it is about before buying it 
 (2.5 Stars) When I first began reading WH, I was turned around a bit on the chracters as well some language styles, so I decided to cheat and check out the list of characters that was in the back. I soon realized how unhelpful it was and very disappointed by its lack of contributing nothing more than the obvious. What I mean is, instead of helping me deciphor who was who and in relation to one antoher, in which a geneology would have been better, they merely gave very short snippets of description that was actually in the text itself. I got through all the relations by my friend who supplied me with a genology chart.  There were also endnotes that state the obvious as well and it was very tedious to have to keep flipping back to see if they would clarify anything. One character speaks in special Englilsh dialect that was difficult to read and understand. The author suggests that you just need to read it aloud and you'll understand it. Granted, that's true, but a translation in the endnotes would have been nice too.   There is a timeline at the beginning, which is nice but I'm not sure what the point of it was and it seemed randomly placed. At the back again, there is a short discussion on the motifs/themes of the book. It was somewhat enlightening but they point out things the reader would have picked up anyway. But, one thing that was really interesting was that there was a short essay on how the book was received from Bronte's time as well into modern times. The short bio at the beginning was done well though.  The overall language of the book was modernized while still keeping certain dialec and stylistic elements of Bronte that didn't really work well. It was very awkward at times but nevertheless, very readable.   Someone who wants a less intimidating introduction to Bronte or any classical works will find this book helpful (& others in this series). But for those of you who are used to a more strict classical interpretation with a more academic flavor, this is NOT the book for you. You will find it somewhat dull, unchallenging and tedious. The language is not very sophisticated nor reminiscent of the linguistic era (which I enjoy, you may not, so...)  The STORY of WH was fascinating. I both hated it and loved it. There were times when I just wanted to chuck the book across the room because I found it SO vile, the charcters so enraged and violent, selfish and horrible. I haven't feld that way since I read Ann Rice's 'Memnoch the Devil'. I've never read a more passionate and fierceer book; and while I read, I was both dreading it yet couldn't wait to see what happened.   I read this several days ago and I'm still buzzing from it. The confusion of the names is a very interesting device, clever and sly. Bronte was ahead of her time, fusing both the gothic novel with supernatural, dramatic and tragic styles. The evolution of 3 generations was so complex yet the progression of each was so vivid and stand out on their own. I haven't decided if I hate or love Heathcliff and Catherine, if even I can forgive them for their nature. And the wonderful way that Bronte wrote was not just the language of words but in the way she used the wilderness of the moors as a description of their wild selves.  
 The Lusiads places the decadence of the epic genre in its end. The Lusiads bears no power, it is only the song of a feeble hero which is not even by far compared to great characters just like Odysseus. Vasco da Gama is uninteresting, he is in no profound context of living except that of praising Portugal's doings in navegation and conquest. Camoes doesn't matter how many peoples were killed and explored in name of this. The Lusiads is, so, a song of ideological doutrination with less masterpiece characteristics, that means it is not a classic, but a book imposed as part of a certain canon. It is not a good book because its aim is not to make art, but to USE art in order to praise the advancement of the portuguese project of conquering and exploring. The Lusiads placement as a classic is, so, ideologically played to a specific economical and religious aim 
 I agree with others who've reviewed this title that the narrator, Steven, is very likable. He's upbeat, even when he's nervous or angry, which is a trait that separates him from other gay characters in many novels. Unfortunately, I found the situations he found himself in -- like dating 24 girls in one month, having a sexy schoolmate throw herself at him, and accidentally starting a new fashion craze at his school -- to be standard-issue sitcom material. Most situations end at the close of each chapter, just like at the end of a TV episode.   The story shows promise in the beginning when Steven describes his attraction to square-dancing: he likes that there is no confusion about what to do. That sentiment seemed so straightforward and heartfelt that I wanted to know more about it and see Steven enjoying it regularly. Instead, the square-dancing group becomes another situation for humor based on deception (a fellow dancer wants to fix Steven up with her grand-daughter and Steven must come up with an excuse not to meet her).  With other good novels covering the teenage coming out process with humor AND depth (like "Blackbird" by Larry Depluchan and "Eight Seconds" by Jean Ferris), I'm afraid I just can't recommend this one. 
 Is  it morally right and tactically wise to publish such a book? It is possible to say that bin Laden does not need a forum, and that his messages are eagerly transmitted by his followers to one another through all modern technical means, including the 'Internet'. And that therefore the presentation of his speeches in chronological order will not give much of a lift or incentive to already committed terrorists. It is possible to argue that those who will read such a book are by and large precisely those who deplore bin Laden, and who simply wish to better understand how this particular evildoer  has deepened in his hatred of the West, and determination to kill innocents, through time. Thus it might be argued that the texts provided simply do a public service in informing us all of the exact nature of one mass- murdererer.  He is to himself the defender of Islam, which he sees attacked by the West, and he has come to the conclusion gradually that the murder of as many Jews and Christians as it takes is justified if this will lead to the Islamic domination of Mankind.  But then again Mr. Bin Laden is not simply  a theorist. He is the man responsible for the murder of thousands of people, including those on 9/11. Giving him another kind of forum somehow does not seem morally wise or right. And this especially as there are hundreds of thousands, no millions of young Muslims , ( and non- Muslims) walking around out there, who might take this book as 'marching orders'. It seems to me the most important point of all is missed by the Editor of this work. Bin Laden may be the name that evokes the most horror. But in fact there are more important leaders in the War Against the West, and the War of Terror to topple Human Civilization than Bin - Laden.He is symbolically the  major leader of  Global Islamic  Strategy but  its most important one now is the President of Iran. The President of Iran is  calling for the destruction of the United States, and the Islamic Rule of the world in terms Bin Laden certainly agrees with. Bin Laden is not as Noah Feldman presents him in his otherwise excellent NY Times review of this book , a 'deviation' from the main stream of Islam today. As we see with the growing power of fundamentalist Islam throughout the world , Bin Laden speaks to the heart of a good share, perhaps a majority of the leaders and people of the Islamic world.   As I understand it the Western world, the free world, the world led by the United States is now in a struggle for its life against a kind of totalitarian force whose aim is to destroy it. Bin Laden will not be the one to lead the legions in doing this. But his written works, his speeches, his communications, his network of Terror, his inspiration to widening circles within the Islamic world , are an important element in this war. Again I am not so sure it was wise to give him this additional forum. 
 Read Andrea Makris' law suit at www.thesmokinggun.com all the dirty details are there, and should be required reading for anyone who reads O'Reilly or takes him seriously. He SETTLED the case after smearing her and threatening her, he's a little wimp and a coward and a "loofa" loving creep. Keep him away from your children! I Know the guy. from Washington  Jeff Gannon 
 First, you really need to have prior exposure to the subject to thoroughly understand some of the topics involved.  Some equations are introduced 'ad hoc' and are not explained, even intuitively.  If you want to know the 'why' and 'how', look to other books such as Lathi's and Proakis's, which are much better.  I found their books to be more systematic, more organized, and simply more logical.  Our professors at my university do not seem to like this book, and the students now know why.  We switched to Communication Systems Engineering by Proakis, which is more mathematically sound and much clearer.  However, you can gain some useful insights from Haykin's book, so I give it two stars instead of one because everything in Haykin's book cannot necessarily be found elsewhere, so it is of use at times 
 This book is "not normal". Unless you create some of the classes in it, its worthless!  Having to "prepare moves" and "stances" sounds nice but it has very limited use because ONLY in those characters can be used 
 This book certainly did not live up to the advertising copy I found on Amazon.com. I found this book to be very poor in terms of usefullness of the contents. It was all fluff and appeared to be aimed, at best, toward management level people who don't have the competence to make factual based decisions on equipment purchases. It not only did not provide facts or data, it didn't provide many clues about how someone trying to make a decision would go about fact based decision making with respect to EDM. The text was highly repetitive in nature. I found its strong advocacy of relying on the manufacturers of equipment for everything from operations knowledge to purchasing evaluation, to be insulting to my inteligence 
 This has to be the worst piece of crap that I've ever heard. The keyboard notes sound like a dying duck or something of that nature. It sounds awful, but the batteries are good. If you need to get 6 AA batteries buy this keyboard. I think the batteries are worth more than this thing. Luckily I got this for free with my order so it isn't all a loss. I needed batteries 
 A cookbook (even one for raw foods) should give you enough information to make the foods included.  This book just doesn't.  My favorite is the recipe for vanilla pudding that lists as ingredients: 1 cup dates, 1/2 cup dates.  That's it.  Did anyone try the recipes?  So many of the recipes require SO MUCH work... and ingredients that are just too hard to find anywhere.  I really like the idea a lot -- and the restaurant is amazing.  But, this book just seems to be on the high-end of raw foods -- most things take a LOT of effort and a multitude of ingredients.  There are problems with several recipes that make me think nothing was reviewed or tested.  For food that is so much work... the very least he could do is make sure it was accurate.  Not a good book for the above-average interest level raw foody person.  I'm a vegan and like the whole raw food thing... but THIS book is a terrible place to start 
 I tried to buy a walker for my grandson and all the walkers were unavailiable. You didnt even have one walker availiable, How is it possible that such a big outlet like yours not to have one walker? I was very disapionted. I guess that I would have to rate you with a zero. And I would like to know when will there be any walkers available? I like to shop with Amazon 
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 I was so disappointed in this book.  The author was so negative that the book was one great big downer.  After the misery of making it through this book, it became clear that it was written by someone who just doesn't get the whole disney thing.  I returned the book and purchased birnbaums and fodors guides which are about 100% better and written in a positive manner.  My husband and I have been to disney world and disneyland many times over the years and are planning our first trip with our children.  No one who feels that the majority of the theme parks are too "hokey" for them, has any business writing a guide for others 
 There are about 20 pages having anything to do with trading. The rest of the book was about his experiences with his Christian faith. What's funny is that for all his searching, he basically concludes that one has to invent Christianity for themselves, so it's not even a good book FOR a religious Christian to read. His brief account of his experiences getting started trading were good, but, after a day or so of flipping through this book I threw it on the floor where it stays until I got over wasting my money on this 
 I am glad I didn't buy this book, but got it from the library.  It definitely is not a good representation of Brockmann's excellent writing.  Maybe it is partly because I read this immediately after reading Lorraine Heath's "Parting Gifts" which is a true romance story and a 5++ star book.  I was just turned off by the sudden sex in the limo with the stranger when it seemed so out of character for Ellen who has teenage children and has never had even close to a one night stand before.  Then the sex in the limo leads directly to "I can't live without her", "I'm in love", without any relationship build up.  Guess I am just getting tired of these trite storylines.  I got tired of Ellen's constantly putting Sam off and telling him she's too old.  After awhile I agreed with her and wanted him to find someone else.  Her fear of being burned again just wasn't convincing enough for me.  This really is the first Suzanne Brockmann book I haven't liked.  She  has a talent for writing romance with humor and good character development.  It just wasn't evidenced here.  For a really great Brockmann, try Heartthrob 
 I have worn Jockeys for almost 20 years, but the quality has gone downhill dramatically in the past few years. The fabric covering the elastic waistband wears out very quickly, and the underwear is, for some unfathomable reason, heavily perfumed! I had to wash them at least 5-6 times to get the smell out. Plus, some of the elastic on the bottom was too tight, and some was so loose I couldn't wear them -- and they were all the same size. Very inconsistent quality. I do not recommend these anymore 
 The author's sole mention of the Book of Concord (1580) is to describe it as "another of history's jokes." (The Book of Concord is a collection of theological writings which resolved outstanding disputes and thereby represents definitive Lutheranism). You may disagree with this compendium or with Aquinas's Summa Theologiae or Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion, but all three were undoubtedly the product of earnest and learned men of God and to dismiss them with a sneer is not the sign of a Christian scholar 
 This was my first Weber novel.  It starts out okay, interesting premise, but Weber quickly forgets his premise (war against terrorist) and goes on unrelated tangents (solving corruption in Mexican politics) and worse.  He obviously did no research on space shuttle ops. A shuttle cmdr is not going to unilaterally decide whether he can make it back to Canaveral during an RTLS abort; Houston has better data to make that call. And the crew certainly would bail out prior to their shuttle ditching in the Atlantic (the crew wouldn't survive a ditching).  Then, Weber says the Atlantis can still be refurbished and flown again.  Huh?  After it was shot down with a missile, ditched in the salt-water of the Atlantic, and sank to the bottom... Unbelieveable!  And how can all airborne traffic be grounded after the U.S. is attacked and yet Weber allows plenty aircraft to be flying around inside his novel, from Weber's own main characters to news helicopters?  A grounding is a grounding, you don't make 1,001 exceptions.  I didn't realize F-14s were still deployed on carriers, haven't they been replaced by the Super Hornets?  And I'm not sure a 30ft long MOAB would fit inside a B-2's bay, I think it's only been dropped from the backend of a C-130 cargo plane.  I find it hard to believe Weber was ever a military pilot, how could he get so many things wrong?  I get the impression the last half of the novel was completed while Weber was on a Caribbean vacation and his editor was calling him telling him the printing press was about to start rolling with or without the last half of his novel.   Perhaps Weber spent little time or thought on the last many chapters, just cranked them out from his beach chair, drunk on Mai-Tai's 
 I normally thoroughly enjoy reading travelogues.  I was looking forward to this book for a week before I found time to read it.  I didn't feel it was worth my time.  I was looking for more information about and feel about the places, and less self-exploration of the authors.  Not bad, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone 
 The control of PowerPoint is excellet except the blank screen button is often accidentally pressed during the presentation.  The laser is very weak and dies often in the middle of a presentation-rather frustrating.  I liked the flash memory initially, but found it troublesome because it takes extra time for the PC to recongnize it and a folder always pops up 
 DJ Spooky, whose work has reached prolific proportions and Dave Lombardo, the drummer for Slayer, collab on this album, but it really just doesn't hit the sweet spot. Each of these guys has a darker  power that could've worked more aptly towards the suggestive title of the album, Drums of Death.  It's funny to me that this album is even called Drums of Death. I was seriously expecting a sonic assualt to come blasting from my speakers. Instead, I found myself laughing and perplexed at the odd (as in, not-so-good) variations of beats I heard.  DJ Spooky's style and perspective is hit and miss sometimes- none the less, moments of brilliance consistently emerge throughout much of his work...just not this work. This album is plainly and unfortunately one of the obvious exceptions to his skill-fullness. For the dope legos try Riddim Warfare and Under the Influence. 
 I wasn't that happy with the book. Seeing the personal post cards the Beatles sent to each other over the years seemed like a good concept. I guess it looked better on paper than reality. For one thing, there aren't many postcards.Two: They are just the average postcards anybody gets when someone travels, except more boring. Nothing more than "having fun, see you soon". That's about the whole lot of them. Each postcard has a one or two line Ringo quip about it. Sometimes they're interesting, mostly not. The only good thing about it is the fact that it was only $10.00 and some or all of the profits go to charity. Even a die hard Beatle fan won't find much to love about this book 
 If you're looking for earth-shattering news, this is not the book for you.  While there were a couple of eye openers, most of the information is well known if you've kept up on current events.   Some information is noteworthy.  The fact that people are killed or injured from prescription medication is not news.  Tragic?  Yes, but it's not a secret.  It is something that has been studied and needs to be addressed. Some information is pointless.  Carl Sagan was a pothead?  Why am I not supposed to know that?  More importantly, what's the significance of that?  Drug and alcohol use is hardly a rarity among great thinkers. Some information is questionable.  Someone in the goverment considered biological warfare in Afghanistan?  I'd be surprised if someone didn't at least think of that.  Creativity is not bad in itself, but the execution of the idea may be.  Considering that Rumsfeld and Rice put the kibosh on the idea, I'd say the government acted correctly, and thus, no shocker here.   There are definitely a few winners in here.  Not a great book, but okay to have in the bathroom for some short reads 
 I found this book to be too wordy.  Theorems are sometimes stated without proofs then followed by several corollaries with proof, followed finally by the proof of the original theorem.  Allusions are made to geometry  unfamiliar to some learning the basics of commutative ring theory.  A nice  book to come back to 
 I've read several authors who will write the same story over and over, in different settings, with different characters, as a means to pay the bills. But Wilbur Smith has no such excuse. From the man who penned 'River God' and 'Seventh Scroll', his publisher should have thrown this piece of drivel straight on the slush pile. When an author injects mystical powers into their signature character, and yet still manages to destroy everything that was magical about them . . . you have wonder just what Wilbur Smith's editor was thinking in letting this manuscript go to press.  Even the basic mechanics of the book are so poorly and carelessly handled as to render them non-existent. It's obvious as one reads that Smith has taken a page out of Compensatory Film Making for Dummies - if the story doesn't hold up, just throw in a heap of special effects (in Smith's case, sex and violence, not to mention the misogyny and racism), and hope no one notices. But even the sex and violence are half-hearted in their execution. I was left feeling as if Smith wrote this book as quickly as possible to fulfil a contractual obligation, sent it to his publisher, and never gave it a second thought. Even poorly written books can be forgiven if there's passion behind the work, but behind this book is an empty void of disinterest. If the author doesn't care about the books he's writing, why should we?  Wilbur Smith's work has been getting progressively more clumsy and formulaic since 'Seventh Scroll'. After this appalling monstrosity, I doubt I'll ever pick up another book of his again.   If you care even one whit for Taita as a character, do not read 'Warlock'; I refuse to acknowledge its existence in the Taita series 
 It takes over half of the book to get to the plot, a criminal who passes away after telling his family that he was a war hero during WW II, and it turns out that he wasn't when the family tries for a military burial, the lead character Private Eye Kinsey Millhone is not the sharpest tack in the box, at least 60% of the writing is vivid descriptions of room decor, scenery and includes the foaming soap bubbles in a sink of dishwater, and if she mentions her underpants once she mentions them 40 times, the ending was too rushed and very unsatisfactory.  This was my first Grafton book, I may go try one of the earlier ones as I can't believe an author this popular writes this style of trivial drivel.  Skip L is for a Loser 
 Some of this book is good and normally I love Suzanne Summers but.... A few comments like " no wonder men leave us for younger woman". Like what is that about? Woman need to feel better for themselves not some guy. Does she not know men also have hormonal problems and aging? When I ran into a few comments like that in the book it turned me off. Woman need to feel good about themselves and look good for themselves first. I just felt the book was a push for the S Principle Book and to be hot for your guy.  Usually her stuff is good but I wasn't crazy about this one. Sorry nothing new in this book. Maybe helpful to someone else. Jud 
 I admit I found the left behind series fascinating at the beginning, but I've noticed a steady decline in the quality of writing in the last few installments books, and a slow homogenization of all the "Trib Saints," into a single character. Absent are the somewhat strong individuals from the earlier books. Instead Rayford and Buck are virtually interchangeable (only Buck cries more). Chloe the super-mom who somehow manages to run an international co-op (along with other stay-at-home moms), from a burned-out skyscraper is an irritating sanctimonious pest, worse still is the transformation of Rayford who has become a one-man Rambo. Ben Judah seems to have become a somewhat disturbing cult-like figure of worship for post trib Christians. Are we honestly expected to believe Ben Judah is the only one who can read and interpret Bible prophecy?  I used to love these books, but I admit, I am tired of most of the main characters. The characters are all egotistical, self-righteous and sanctimonious. They show no compassion for the sufferers who are taking the mark, and even seem to take a certain glee in baiting Carpathianists and unbelievers.  Carpathia himself has become a buffoon. A cartoon villain about as scary as any villain on a Saturday morning cartoon. While I liked the series, the authors were at their best when the Trib force were a 'small group' out to defend Christianity from the anti-christ. In the Mark, they are clearly running the show. Ridiculous.  2 Stars. 
 This book is barebones and just contains lists and lists of games and prices. Weighing in with 149 pages, the book is a complete - with its 19.95 price (it would have been a complete waste at $1.95 but that's besides the point).   However, if you're looking for bargains, then go no further than this price guide. Where else are you going to find Magicard for $40? Or Malagai for $30? Or Mangia for $14? My person favorite is Air-Raid, which The Official Guide has for $1000-$3000. In the 2004 Video Game Price Guide, it's a mere $30! It would be nice if the author of this book backed-up his prices by selling these games at these ridiculous prices. All I could say is if you want a laugh on par with that of Midnight Tiger, then buy this book. Everyone else stay away 
 don't waste your time let alone your money on this book. The author is so full of it and i seriously doubt he could trade his way out of a wet paper bag. I've been to his "Casino War Games" seminar and he talks the talk but he can't walk the talk or put his money where his mouth is, especially not in the casino or the markets. All he cares about is upselling his snake oil seminars etc... 
 If you have heard the songs on the albums covered, and ever read the album covers, save the ink trees and paper wasted on this lame caper. The lyrics and songs are full of misquotes, nothing novel or of note was wrote, paraphrasing the misheard words of spitfire rhymes I've heard a thousand times and apparently this punk "author" had transcribed. Other reviewers explained that is was a lame biography but showed stories that transpired that inspired the spirit of the lyrics you hear, but they obviously were as frightfully uninsightful as the writer. Let me save you the six bucks for the used with the truth: When it's slim spittin' about drugs, it's for fun and humor...When it's Em about family, it's addressin' the rumors...When it's a diss it's clear and every lyric is what your hear and means, love Em or hate `im, what is said verbatim. 
 The last "5-star" review was written by the author, Jim Stewart, himself. Please readers take note that all the "5-star" reviews were written by him, aliases, and co-authors. In addition, you can see that "1-star" reviews of competitors' books were also written by this same group of individuals. I wish Amazon would verify the reader reviews so that this service would be authentic and useful. Mr. Stewart - don't you know that what you did was unethical? and don't you know that if other books on Lost do well, that it only helps your book do the same? Shame on you 
 This collection of essays is a complete joke. Christian Kim is completely ignorant of Jewish law. These essays are incoherent and poorly argued. Many key historical facts have been distorted, omitted and even invented to fit Kim's crazy arguments. It seems to me that Kim is on a crusade to destroy Jews and Israel. I would stay well away from this book, it really is crap 
 I love these bars, they are high in protien, and are good supplements, How ever The 3 boxes I got were all expired. Beware of sale items on bars like this 
 The author was obviously inspired by the best movie of 1997, L.A. Confidential, to dig into archival photos to show the "real Los Angeles." However, his ugly condemnation of the city--a city that needs to be "redeemed"--is as hysterically false as the boosterism of the "noir era" that proclaimed the metropolis as an eden of sunshine and wealth. His iconoclastic glee is a little too much. Are we really to be shocked that in a city of millions you'll find crime, gangsters, potheads, gambling joints, religious frauds and crooked cops? And author Heimann, breathless as he seems to be, is hardly the first to dredge the underbelly of the glamour capital of the world. Writers like Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain and Nathanael West did so many, many years ago. As other reviewers have noted, the photos are interesting but the text is witless and non-instructive. And his generalizations are annoying. As a lifelong Angeleno, most of the city's residents--then and now--are ordinary folks working hard to make a living and raise their families. This comes off as a smear job. I don't love L.A., but I don't think it's a non-redeemed hellhole either, now or in its history. Chronicle Books is one of my favorite publishers, but this is very poor journalism verging on propaganda 
 so very boring... i gave up halfway in. i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time. my sister liked it though. 
 there's plenty of other reviews that have already commented on the copy protection. i just wanted to point out that i'm another lost sale. as a linux user, the copy-protection really wasn't going to stop anything, but it's the principle of the matter.  big kottke fan, big mike fan, big "clone" fan. sorry guys. maybe one day there will be a real cd i can buy. i'm disappointed 
 i wouldn't recommend this product.  The positive terminal clamp broke in half the first time i used it... I, as I was stranded, rigged up a method to make contact with the terminal w/ the remaining half of the clamp.  Then the charger (which was charged fully the previous night) didn't provide enough power to actually turn the engine over.  I will be returning to the store tonight, returning this item, and purchasing a different charger 
 I bought these shoes for work to wear with my scrubs (with socks). I had to return them due to several issues: The inside lining was too slippery. I went for a brisk walk and my feet slid so much inside the shoe that they felt like they were on fire from friction! Tightening them did not work, as the top of the shoe tore away the skin from the top of my foot, leaving open sores. Even when walking at a normal pace, the shoe kept sliding away from my heel when I stepped. Thirdly, the sole of the shoe is very narrow; it felt like walking in ice skates! These were very cute...and may be great for biking, but not so great for everyday walking 
   I "enjoyed" viewing this film and seeing "the good guy" win. But, "there must be a better way" to resolve conflicts, "a better way" to punish bad guys,  "a better way to deal with evil" than just go out and kill everyone involved!  We live in a violent world with terrorists and suicide murderers and car bombings and killing our troops in Iraq and The Sunnis killing the Shiites and vice versa, etc..etc.   I always believe there MUST be "a better way" besides everyone killing the other guys.  So, that's what I have against this film.  As for the film itself, I enjoyed the musical theme and the acting of Clint Eastwood and the acting of all the other members of the cast. It is a "good film" except for the violence.   And, yes, "the good guy" does win in the end---I'm happy about that!  And, I enjoyed the photography also.  So, yes, definitely SEE the film but as you do, could you possibly think of "a better way" for resovling issues rather than the violence depicted in this film?  Email:boland7214@aol 
 Great movie. The problem is in the medium of delivery.  There are 2 dvds in the package. Each dvd contains approximately 1/2 of the movie.  The audience/customer would be better served if the entire movie was on one dvd.  In addition, the 2nd dvd is defective.   The scene where Alexander's father is assasinated consists of some normal footage, many lengthy 'still' pictures, no picture at all for a period of time, and a short period that looked like satelite feed was breaking -- all on a dvd that's supposed to be flawless 
 This translation is completely unfaithful to the original.  This copy cannot be prayed or medidated with.  It's attempt to use modern language and expressions destroyed the beauty of this classic.  It is not any easier to read than more faithful translations 
 This work on foraging theory is extremely weak on all aspects of foraging theory or ecology. I would recommend to interested individuals almost all other textbooks on foraging, most which are much more informative 
 Book contains poor photography and what appears to be over-reproduced images of hardware.  Prospective buyer should look at some of the aviation publications that offer the same or better information to Experimental Aircraft builders.  Some of the same principles apply 
 beautiful color, but very small in size, i guess i should have checked he pearl size first instead of just looking at the pictur 
 This is the story of Stingo, a 22 y/o aspiring writer in NYC in 1947 who meets a pair of lovers, Sophie and Nathan, at his boarding house and is drawn into their dysfunctional relationship, falling in love with both and witnessing their self-destruction.  Nathan is a mentally deranged and drug-addicted genius.  Sophie is a haunted Polish survivor of Auschwitz.  Her story unfolds as she confides to Nathan the awful truths of her unwillingness to join the Polish resistance, her eventual capture over a small infraction and her heart-destroying choice when she arrives in the camp--she must decide which of her children will live and which will be sent immediately to the gas chamber.  While Nathan and Sophie are both fascinating, fully-realized characters with terrible obstacles, Stingo, the narrator, is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his narrative to.  Despite his thirty or so years of perspective on the events of '47 which he is relating, he seems to possess little or no wisdom about them, no intriguing viewpoints about his life or his friends' tragedies, and his actions and attitudes at the age of 22 are so immature and superficial as to be almost unbearable.  The novel is far too long--it could be nearly cut in half and only benefit.  The narrative style is foolishly ponderous, far over-written, especially in the first half.  And in the end while the structure of narrator/observer seems like a fine choice in the abstract, the specific narrator and his terrible lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of Nathan and Sophie.  In the end, the narrator never even approaches the key question in my mind:  why did Sophie so quickly choose Eva to die rather than Jan?  A lack of true understanding of what would happen to the girl?  A blind panic?  A preference for her son, the sort of harmless preference many parents may harbor that is never important because we are never asked to choose?  It is this having chosen which seems more than the other tragedies to have really destroyed Sophie, and yet it's glossed over in the narrative.  In fact, it's followed by Sophie and Stingo having an endless night of 'fu---ng' as the novel would put it.  Really?  Almost hard to believe Sophie could get it together to have peremptory sex after her drinking and her terrible revelations.  She uses sex to escape with her lover Nathan, but it's hard to imagine this all-night sexcapade Stingo relates.  Could it be that Styron only knows how to connect people through sex?    How this could be considered one of the greatest American novels of all time is a mystery to me.  The potential is there, but only a truly talented, dedicated editor could have rescued the book from itsmany structural and linguistic failures 
 They chosen Robin Williams to be in a Disney movie and this movie turned out to be very corny. Special effects are dull though. If I were a kid I would probably like this movie but now that I'm 15 I think it's stupid. I think I saw it in theater when I was 8 and I don't remember much of it but I think it's not in stores anymore out to buy because people don't really care much about this movie anymore. I don't care about it either. I'm glad this movie is out of stock and it should be. It is very boring! 
 I agree with much of what has been written, but somehow fail to understand how anyone could have thought that there was a supposed "relationship" between the teenage daughter and the filthy father. One only needs to look at the scene where the girl is desperately crying in the martello tower to see that she is in all effects being "raped" by her father.   His loathsome and disgusting nature is cemented with the scene regarding the baby (!!) Unfortunately this "is" reality, and am sad to agree with a reviewer's comments that this is a "terrible truth" -  Although I do admire Tilda Swinton and am far (very far) from being prude or narrow minded, I am left wondering whether films like this actually fuel grotesque and depraved behaviour in certain minds-  
 This book is primarily for folks who are thinking of buying, building, or having built a trawler and to take it on long cruises. This is not a book for those who already own a trawler and are trying to find ways to improve them and preparing them for cruising 
 ... and i absolutely love the first owen record and all american football.  how does one go from 5 stars to 2?  First, make obscenely personal songs all about yourself and a girl who broke up with you.  i have a tv for this kind of stuff.  then, just make the songs mediocre.  there are two really good songs though, although i would be embarrased to listen to it in front of anyone else (but i guess the same goes with the first owen album).  good songs=ghost of what..., and i'm not going anywhere.  i guess i just liked the atmospheric stuff better than the raw acoustic sound heard here 
 I love Nigella's TV show, but was very disappointed in this book.  The format is downright confusing and the recipe directions poor.  The recipe for Barbados Cream says to mix all ingredients, but she doesn't really mean for you to mix in the brown sugar.  Recipes tell you to "beat til fairly stiff but not too stiff" (whatever that means) with no time recommendations.  She talks about simple, unpretentious food but includes some very odd ingredients and complicated directions.  There seems to be more effort put into the glib tone of the writing than into the food 
 --and I've used a LOT of grinders. VERY badly designed, and the "custom" thing is a gimmick and a sham: it's a standard rotary grinder. They just added flashing lights and extra buttons, and made it look bulkier. Every day was a misery dealing with this thing: it's designed so that you have no choice but to spill grinds all over the place when you use it 
 Another guy who didn't know Bukowski trying to make a quick buck off his corpse. Too bad. A waste of money. Read Bukowski instead. Also, the print is so small you'll need a magnifying glass. Thumbs down. This is the worst of the lot 
 Last night I finished this book and it was probably the most awful book I've ever read. Written by a fictional character as a spin-off of the television show "Lost," it is a mystery loosely related to the show's back story. That is, it involves companies and institutions that exist in the "real life" of the show. Very meta. I'm not a fan of mysteries, so maybe I'm a little biased to begin with. I expected a light and easy read. I expected some writing to chuckle at, but not something to be truly annoyed by. Shouldn't a private detective be able to do some deducing on his own? He seemed not to have an original thought at all. And when he reached a decision, some sort of epiphany, it never came through any sort of deliberation. It took about half the novel to even get the story along enough for us to understand what mystery we were sorting out. But even at that point I had faith that it would all turn out well. People enjoy these sorts of books, so it should have all the necessary tricks. Soon enough we had a murder of one of the principal characters that occurred off the page, and then we were at the dramatic scene. Then something surprising and unexplained, not foretold, happens, then 'end scene.' Then the last few pages of the book are spent with three characters talking about everything and explaining what happened, why people were killed, the villain's motivations and the like. Then it was over. I hate it when movies have to explain it to you through dialogue at the end, and I'm certainly insulted when a book does it to me. "Ugh," I said as I put the book on my night stand 
 I was eager to read this book only to find it a terrible dissapointment.  One would think that a 'scholar' such as he would have at least a basic understanding of the Hebraic roots of Judeo-Christianity.   It was obvious that he clearly was clueless to the known Messianic signs spoken of in the Gospels.  He is also clueless to the Pharisidical Judaism of the time..not comprehending that all of Christ's teachings were completely in keeping with true Judaism. All of which can be found in contemporary Rabbinical teachings of His time. This book, which some unfortunate readers will swallow as truth will only continue to propagate a backward understanding of the gospels.   Like it or not..the New Testament writings are Hebraic and explain what fulfilled Judaism is.  Those who need to divorce Judaism from Christianity are offering a church which is already confused, just more confusion. It is through studying the Hebraic roots that we even begin to understand the 'difficult' sayings of our Lord; 'fullfillment of the Law', binding and loosing (the Law)..etc as well as the parables.  The delivering of the deaf mute..was a Messianic sign, because the Rabbi's knew that 'they' had to ask the said demon its name but He did not.  Lazerus's resurrection was a Messianic sign because the Rabbi's believed that anyone could come back to life during the first 'three' days after death.  Cleansing of a leper was  Messainic sign because the Rabbi's understood that it was a 'divine' punishment, that only God could lift. How else can we link Isa 53 with the 'stripes' He was to received as part of fulfilling the punishment the Law required for transgression, and yet 'minus one'. Had our Lord transgressed the Law, then the Jews themselves could have legally killed Him.  Remember Paul (Saul)?  He also does not understand John and his huge part in the whole picture, in that the Kingdom 'began' with John.  He was the 'breachmaker' as fortold in prophecy.  This is Hebraic roots 101.   People, please study the Hebraic roots of Christianity and do not waste your time with this book. The fact that he keeps defending his position as 'not' anti-semetic, should give you a clue 
 This book is too big an attempt by the famed Harvard biology professor to try to cover "everything". If we compare Mr. Wilson's "total map" with Mr. Ken Wilber's attempt on the same kind of synthesis. It will become obvious that Mr. Wilson fell short because he puts an "Environmental Policy" category where a "Spirits/Psychology" one is more appropriate. How can any integration attempt misses such important inner subjects?! I guess Mr. Wilson decided that he will stick to his iconoclastic scientism view rather than being open-minded. We, as readers, should be aware of his bias. There was a Newsweek bookreview article titled: "Why Wilson is Wrong" published in 1999.  
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 I SUBMITTED MY REVIEW TWICE! WHY IS IT NOT BEING PUBLISHED? PLEASE REPLY  
 This book is geared towards teenegers and recommended for ages 9-12 by Amazon. I am 39 and found it to have way too many big words and full of poor humor. Overall, I think there are alot better books on this subject for teenagers 
 The author spends half of the book telling you about the "business" of auto body repair, then glosses over the actual "how-to".  I bought the book to learn how to fix simple dents on my vintage car.  Looks like I'll have to buy another book to find out how to do that 
 As many reviewers have indicated, this book is not nearly as good as Patterson's earlier works.  Is it possible Patterson now employs a ghost writer?  For people who enjoy thrillers, his first few books are fun. Don't bother with recent ones, though 
 Why American production make HK movies look so cheap? First of all, they cut off so much scene, second of all ruin it by making look acting so dumb by English Dubb. For ANY of HK movies, ALWAYS stick with ORIGINAL LICENSED HK RELEASE. Be careful with cheap imports, boots though 
 This textbook relies on more handwaving arguments than my Quantum textbook! Griffiths seems to be under the impression that he is an astounding mathematician and the reader can barely integrate. The "proofs" of almost every key concept are either fleshed out in "Well suppose... then this might happen..." or altogether left to the reader. It was a fun challenge to actually write a proof for a lot of them, too... maybe Griffiths should have tried it when he wrote the book. If the reader does every single problem in the book, he or she may have a mid-undergrad level understanding of basic E&M. Very little relativity, and no Quantum mechanical aspects are covered (if I remember correctly) 
 I do not usually leave comments about purchases but this Johnson/Broida offering is so dismal it deserves a mention.  You will be much better off with Palm's online documentation/help files and forget about wasting your money on this turkey.  Truly a real disappointment.  No fault for Amazon....delivery was, as usual, very fas 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 For those of you who are not sure where you stand on the big-retailer issue, this piece of pure elitist "culture of fear" rabidly pro-collectivist propaganda is junk. This DVD is Wal-mart haters sewing together the most bald-faced microscopic disinformation in order inspire people to despise a corporation that has the power to restrict union organizing in their business. That's the whole enchilada for these spoil-sports. If you have any concern about issues relating to power, economic and social consequences, and the direction retail marketing is going, DO NOT expect to get much out of this but some Hitlerian diatribe about the Evil Empire of Wal-Mart. Try reading some good articles or watching other documentaries, but if you're just too lazy to think for yourself and want to be sucked into this caricature of corporate hatred, by all means go over to the darkside, Luke. I wish I could give this zero stars.  
 I read this in passing at the new San Jose Main Public Library the other day. These coauthors' writing is as harsh as Ann Coulter's but of an opposite persuasion.  However, their use of citations and supporting documentation is lacking.  It is mostly up to the reader to guess which points are supported by which references in the bibliography.  There are no footnotes, just mere page number references.  A great number of references are simply for the sprinklings of quotations used.  The fact, that Alterman and Green are employed by any journal, is chilling and an insult for that employer. Alterman, intending to attack "neocons," uses an example of voter intimidation in places like Baltimore where the "Get out the Vote" advertisments also say "...and take care of your oustanding warrants, overdue rent, etc..."  Another example is one that persuades people to show up at the polls days after election day.  [Incidentally, the book's issues like this are debatably related to the topic of President Bush...] So much for the idea of a "well-informed electorate!" Such voter intimidation is not just sad but almost laughable. First, does anyone want to admit depending on a voter base of individuals who fall for intimidation like this?  This was an insult to liberal causes!  To think this was a great book, you too would probably fall for voter intimidations like these examples given by Alterman and Green. Second, are these guys trying to tell us that a qualification, to be considered a minority, consists of being duped by garbage like this?  What an insult to minorities! Third, if these guys are responsible journalists, can they report on anybody of their own polity that might be doing something about the state of the electorate's information?  While Alterman and Green make this point on their own voter base being so inadequate with any base of knowledge, they are trying to make a point, by begging the question from the first page, that President Bush himself has a very inadequate base of knowledge.  Worse yet, Alterman and Green propose that a bad state of knowledge is further demonstrated by President Bush's tendency to ask "stupid" questions.  Perhaps all readers should reflect on whether it is better to have stupid questions asked than to have stupid results occur when nobody has the courage to ask stupid questions.  And back to the concept of a "well-informed electorate," real education begins with real questions.  It is too bad that Alterman and Green have evidently been too proud to ask any questions, starting with "Why did so and so ask such and such question?" instead of jumping to their conclusions.  Another example of Alterman and Green's points is that President Bush's tendency to leave the "details" to others is a weakness.  It would have been more useful to their point to expound on how this balances one's own core competencies with those of others.  It's an effective corporate strategy.  Maybe journalists know nothing about that.  Alterman and Green's publication is a strike out for journalism. If you are a proponent of progressiveness or of the idea of a "well-informed electorate," this book does not help either of these causes 
 I just received my copy yesterday and am up to the beginning of the "D" section (the movies are listed alphabetically) and I've already been disappointed by numerous factual errors by the writer (writer rather than "author" because the title "author" carries with it a certain level of professional expertise which seems scarce in this book).  For example, her description of the story line for Creature from the Black Lagoon obviously is confused with the story line for one of the sequels to that film and is totally wrong.  Most disappointing 
 In the introduction Mr Summers tells the reader that there has never been an unbiased and factual account of witchcraft.  He tries to pass his book off as being unbiased, when in fact he is using the exact same bias found in the 17th and 18th centuries.  He likens witchcraft to devil worship, likens to the pagan celebrations to sexual orgies and debauchery.  Like the rest of the fools of his day, he got it wrong.  Was there devil worship going on in his day?  Most certainly there was.  Fertility rituals for crops, healing the sick from natural medicines, and folk practices are not devil worship.  The bible describes Lucifer (i.e the devil, satan) as a beautiful angel.  The church, made by and run by man, created a foul image of the devil being half man and half beast, like many of the old pagan gods.  The accounts of witchcraft found in this book are twisted and perverted to fit into the scope of devil worship.  He makes hurdles of judgement, leaps to conclusions, and formulates opinions based on fiction.  He seems to be determined to make witchcraft out to be evil, in fact seems determined to make anything other than catholicism out to be evil.    Summers is a fool, just like his peers, and produced a "history" of witchcraft and demonology based on superstition and fear.  Why a man of god uses the tools of the devil is beyond my realm of understanding.  Don't waste your time reading this heap if you are interested in pre-christian religions.  Don't read this heap if you are interested in demons.  The only reason I would recommend reading this book is to see how christians view pagans and their religion.  This is as bad as it gets.   The sad thing is, some of Summers' other books are really quite good.  I read his books about vampires and werewolves about ten years ago, and rather enjoyed them.  It would be more accurate to call this book a "history of devil worship and demonology." 
 Adults would never choose to read this garbage. It would be seen as masochistic [...] and too depressing to bother with. Raise an animal, get attached to it, but the reality of farm life is that if it can't successfully breed, you personally will have to butcher it. Heck, why should your dad do it for you, when we can reinforce that valuable childhood lesson of "Life sucks and then you die"?  What is the real point of this book? Do teachers everywhere get a vicarious thrill at the horror kids must experience when reading this stuff? My kid asked me to read it aloud to him when he couldn't take it anymore, and I got to the point where I hurled it across the room. Between this and all the other depressing books we make kids read, are we surprised when they are cynical goths?  AVOID THIS BOOK, if you love your kids 
 This movie strains too hard to be about "adulthood" and relationships.  It has no depth because it is apparently too close to home for those involved (moore and her husband), and apparently they don't have the life experience to make anything that rises above all the silly cliches in this movie.  Read the review by "the most annoying movie I have", he/she hits on the head.  It is sad because of the talent involved, including moore.  Even Billy Crudup fails to shine.  
 The point that both sides miss: There is no where in any of the scouts aims, methods, programs or awards where it discusses homosexuality.  God, yes. Sexual preference, no. Just leave scouting alone.   
 This book is for novices who has very little knowledge on IPv4 and now trying to know something about IPv6. My sincere advice to any serious reader on IPv6 would be, never go for this book. It gives no information but stories about how internet evolved and kind of stuff. And anybody who is working deeply on IPv4 would know that. And this book gives fifty to sixty pages of printed RFCs, may be to make the book bulky 
 This book has excellent reviews but I couldn't even make it to the end.  Could just be the wrong author for me but was expecting a lot more.  The main character, Maggie, just didn't do it for me and the romantic part of it well, enough said.  I would recommend borrowing it from the library before you buy it.  It is my first Lauren Dane book so maybe I will give another one a shot, we will see 
 This book is truly outdated, don't bother to read it. Today it does not add anything to brand management. Most articles concentrate on arguments against line extensions but do it in a superficial way. It is easy to read but very light and almost totally commonsensical. The only part that I like in the book was the case of a shampoo that lagged appeal over time on which a couple of experts offered different solutions. This demonstrates what students often don't understand about case teaching: That there is no single "solution".     
 This is the first Grafton book I've read, but I'm pretty sure it will be my last.  Simply put, this is the worst book I've read in the past year.  The plot is ridiculous: it centers around the murder of woman who is prostitute/porn star/water treatment plant worker.  The characters only exist as canned responses to the investigator's questions.  Critical clue are revealed in predictable fashion to achieve an utterly anti-climactic ending devoid of any epiphanies or suspense.  
 An inferior rip off of Mary Janice Davidson's Wed books. If she just toned down the Sex in the City dingbat -Chick Lit silliness the book might have actually been interesting. Too much about the clothing,shoes, shopping. Avoid paying full pric 
 I liked Terry McMillan's "The Interruption of Everything", so I was really looking forward to reading this book- but it was one of the worst, most frustrating books I've ever read. First of all, the writing is on about a sixth-grade level. Example: "...Charles asked me if I wanted to dance. I said yes. So we danced. He danced like a man who was sure of himself. He watched me. I watched him. He smiled at me. I smiled at him." That's when I rolled my eyes and gave up. Unfortunately it was on page 365!! From then on I scanned the rest of the pages, just to satisfy my curiosity about what would happen to the rest of these characters. Secondly, most of the characters are complete morons, except for Gloria, who seemed real to me. (Working mom, single, trying to do the best for her son...) The other three jump into bed with EVERY man they meet, usually within the first three hours of meeting him. Then they whine and moan about how there are no good men out there. Well, DUH!!! Perhaps this is the point of the book, self-fufilling prophecy. I do like the title. It describes that feeling of waiting while what you want (husband, job, baby, etc.) hasn't happened yet. But this book was a disappointing waste of time. 
 I am now graduating from school and looking back at this class, this book, I do not agree with it at all. Hopefully your instructor will not use this book 
 First one came cracked, second one came chipped.  Gave up 
 The Decalogue is one of several excellent TV series by European directors that puts US TV to shame. Like Bergman's "Scenes from a Marriage" & "Fanny & Alexander," von Trier's "The Kingdom," Fassbinder's "Berlin Alexanderplatz," Kusturica's "Underground," and Petersen's "Das Boot," The Decalogue was initially conceived as a series on television and eventually brought to US viewers' attention on the large screen via a limited art house run. Unlike these other series, Kieslowski's was conceived as ten separate stories that were only tied together by the fact that the stories all involved people in the same housing block (and characters from one episode may pop up in another).  The stories of The Dekalog are morality plays, but they are not re-enactments of The Ten Commandments, but rather inspired by them, and ultimately it is left to the viewer to decide the connection between the two.  Kieslowski & Piesiewicz wrote the ten screenplays and decided to do the 10 stories themselves (instead of contracting 10 of Poland's best up & coming director's to do each, as was initially planned), and instead hired a different cinematographer for each of the stories.  I won't comment on the content of the stories as many have already done so, and I feel that that would minimizes the impact of the experience of watching them, so I will comment on Kieslowski's style. Kieslowski has stated that his intent is to highlight personal consequences of a dramatic nature.  His films often tackle issues of political import, however he intentionally avoids making "issue films," but rather focuses on the personal consequences of those affected, as he feels that politics solves nothing & that films do not really change the political culture. His views on film stem from his experience as a director who stayed in Poland before, during & after the Solidarity movement. Initially he started as a documentary film maker, but as he saw that audiences were more interested in fiction and that documentary film-making has an impact on the lives of its subjects, he switched to his unique fictional style.   This Facets 3-disc set of The Dekalog is apparently an improvement over the 2-disc version previously available, in that the picture quality is a little better, however it is still a far cry from what it could have been if Criterion had released this series. First, Facets has a mandatory ad for itself that automatically plays when you insert a disc & you have to let it play out before you can get to the menu. To add to that, you also have to watch another ad each and every time you select an episode to watch & after the end of each episode, very annoying. Then the picture quality isn't as good as it could be. Not only is there evidence of flaws in the film (scratches and blotches), but the film isn't a true digital copy of the original series, but rather a copy of someone's PAL tape of the broadcast, so the image is no better than watching a VHS tape.  The picture is also cropped from the original, especially on the bottom. The picture at times jitters, especially during the ending credits. The English subtitles are minimal, at times missing dialogue, and can not be turned off. There are some nice extra features, particularly a broadcast from Polish television of an interview of Kieslowski with a number of Polish journalists. However the quality of the picture of this is worse than on The Dekalog, and the entire dialogue is spoken over by people in English with no option to turn of the English dub & use subtitles instead. Apparently all of the other (imported) editions of The Dekalog are of better quality & offer more extras than this edition, which is inexcusable given the price 
 I'm a big fan of her other works, but this one was so fragmented and uninspired that I quit without finishing.  Life is too short to waste time reading bad books 
 This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering "why?" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some "excitement" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY??? 
 This book is NOT Comparative Anatomy of the Vertebrates as listed.  It is Cram101 Textbook Review to accompany a textbook.  This is very false advertising and Amazon should correct the listing so that further people are not misled.  
 This product is the worst of its kind! It lasted a couple of months at the most, it is not at all worth the price, no matter how cheap. I picked one up at WalMart for ten bucks that works great, don't waste your time on this one. It is cheap, but don't be had, stay away from this product 
 The best thing about this book is the title. It's a beautiful sentiment and one that was expressed well in one little vignette. Otherwise this book was so mediocre...OMG. It was bad. Simplistic. Saccharine. It was like reading the work of someone still in the first year grad writing program, as the main character reflects. Not only could you see the plot wrap-up a mile away, I sort of felt like I needed to take a shower afterwards lest I get attacked by a swarm of bees coming for the sticky sweetness.This book is a major pass unless you typically enjoy the recommendations of USA Today 
 This book was my book club's book this month.  We were all disappointed with the shallow, psychotic characters and the depressing story line.  The title and cover make one expect a love story, when really it follows more along the lines of a sick and twisted tragedy.  Foreshadowing was too obvious, and love did not seem to be a priority (promiscuity, death, and drug use seemed to be the main topics here).  Stay away if you are expecting a love story, or even a very interesting book 
 ¿Por qué se le ocurrió a Tim Burton hacer un remake de este clásico? El resultado no puede ser peor... Sólo fui a verla porque sale Tim. Que vestido de primate resultes igual de atractivo y apasionado que siempre es lo único que vale la pena de toda la historia.  Tus ojos siguen emitiendo fuego. ¡Qué no se apague nunca! You Are The Best! 
 This is a lousy "Greatest Hits" compilation.  It fails to include the #1 I Just Wanted You Know, #3 Your Love Is A Miracle, among other top 5-10 hits meaning you'll still have to go through and buy the rest of the albums to truely have "the greatest hits".  All together, Id say its missing about 6 tracks needed to be a true "Greatest Hits".  It does include a couple of new songs and one is pretty good which is the only reason I can give this album two stars instead of one 
 Not much information to find in this book, though it can be entertaining if you are bitter and need to find something to read while you are in the same situation.  Don't look for answers from this self helper, there are none.  Spend your money on ice cream instead.  You'll be happy you did 
 I sat down to read about this after hearing about it for years, and I want my week back. It only took that long because I had to push myself to finish it.  SPOILERS AHEAD: Meggie and Father Ralph (who everyone always seems to refer to as Ralph de Bricassart, even when they're talking to him) meet when he is twenty-six and Meggie is...ten. She speaks, acts and thinks like a 5-year-old, though. As the years go by, Father Ralph de Bricassart becomes sort of a father figure to little Meggie, and she develops a girlish crush on him. As Meggie is also "developing a very feminine figure," Ralph comes to love her in return but realizes that their love can never be. They discuss this in approximately fifteen thousand "Don't love me, my darling, for I love you but you know our love is forbidden and can never be" conversations throughout the book. Finally, after years of smothering their passion, they do it. In a really very boring scene that's all inner ruminating and blurred descriptions. And wouldn't ya know it, she gets pregnant. Ralph de Bricassart realizes (again) that their love can never be, and leaves. Meggie has his baby, and capers about gleefully that she's "stolen" something back from God. But wouldn't ya know it, the kid (who's as angelic and one-dimensional a boy I've ever encountered in literature) decides to be a priest. So she sends him to Father Ralph de Bricassart for training, who--get this--is so totally brain dead that IT NEVER ONCE OCCURS TO HIM THAT THIS MIGHT BE HIS CHILD!!!!!!! Apparently arithmetic is not a compulsory part of training for the priesthood; this guy also misses an incredibly broad hint from Meggie, when even the other priests figure it out. The Big Secret finally does come out (again in a very brief, anticlimactic scene) toward the end, but by then we're too busy skimming to really care.  All this leaves out a great many things--including immortal dialogue that makes Meggie sound perpetually ten years old ("I'll tell you something else about your roses, Ralph de Bricassart--they've got nasty, hooky thorns!"), endless, heavyhanded symbolism (ashes of roses, thorn birds...we get it! we get it!), some dumb subplot concerning a brother who is absent for 90% of the book, and one of the most unintentionally hilarious "tragic" scenes I've ever read (death by pig). Yet the Ralph-and-Meggie storyline really is the only major thing going on. And we never really get to see what it is that draws these two people together. I was expecting other subplots and development of other characters, and this never really happened. Many of the other relationships were sketchy and/or very confusing: Meggie's cruel judgment of her daughter Justine as a "monster" and a "b* tch," for example, seemed to have no basis. The last third or so involves Meggie making peace with her mother and daughter, and it just doesn't matter. The quick "the end" wrap-up would have been an even greater letdown if I'd still cared by that point. Even the most developed characters are flat and lifeless, and thoroughly unlikable. Scarlett O'Hara was selfish, but she was fun; these people are selfish and boring. Sickly-sweet quasi-romantic trash. 
 I bought this epilator solely for upper lip hair, it takes off most of it but I dont think it epilates coz u can still see minute hair which wont be caught up in the blades and also the hair regrow in 2-3 days...much like shaving it off. I would rather goto the salon every 2 weeks than use this every 3rd day. Moreover, on underarms, it pains as much as the other epilators so if you already have one, dont waste your money on this one 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 I must say you are getting a very good price and these are very comfortable. You also do not notice anything "irregular".  However, I ordered these to use as boxers -- that is to wear them around the house. Not a good plan. These are very thin, plus the fly is very narrow. All in all, not very useful for my intended purpose 
 Aaron Sisson works in the English mining industry, and is also a talented flortist. Disenchanted with his life, he leaves his wife and children and finds work with an orchestra in London. There, and in Italy, he tries to come to terms with his life and emotions whilst finding new acquaintances in London society and then with Britons in Italy.   The novel centres on Aaron's alienation, his retreat from and aversion to responsibility for others: it is right to stay in a relationship when you are feeling untrue to yourself by doing so? Just what are individuals' responsibilities to each other?   These are familiar Lawrence themes and will come as no surprise to those who have read his other works. It's also very much a novel of its time: pseudo-fascist ideas are in the air - social Darwinism and Nietzschean thought permeate the attitudes of the main characters, especially Lilly.  That being said, this is somewhat second-rate Lawrence. It's a very bitty novel: it was written in haste, sections completed then left for a considerable amount of time. And it reads like that. Few of the characters are convincingly drawn, others appear then disappear without reason and without contributing to the novel in any meaningful way. The strength of the prose is variable, with large sections of the novel stagnating as a result.  One for those interested in reading Lawrence's lesser-known works, but I should imagine a turn-off for those trying him out for the first time.  G Rodger 
 Garrison and Oliver Stone both did history a disservice. See JFK: Breaking the News and When the News Went Live: Dallas 1963 
 I watched this film yesterday at a library, and found its lack of depth and analysis to be dumbfounding.    During the first minute, they tell how the revolution began when high bread prices sparked a violent uprising.  During the next 99 minutes they narrate the chronological events of increasing violence, using acted scenes, fake blood and sound bytes from "scholars", to give a "play-by-play" summary of the carnage and beheadings, leading up to a mention of Napoleon.    During the last thirty seconds, they surprisingly conclude by saying that the French Revolution was a very good thing, because it inspired China and Vietnam and because Louis was a tyrant.  Prior to this little or no mention had been made of Louis' tyranny, although the film had dwelt on his  bedroom difficulties in some detail and also mentioned his weight problem a few times.    After watching 90 minutes of bloody scenes, I found the films conclusion that the French Revolution was a good thing to be an incomprehensible non sequitur.  I would have liked to have seen some historical analysis to support this conclusion 
 This movie is so bad. It is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems. The only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character, a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities. The movie tries hard to invent new "teen speak" with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character, Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end, she's like Ella May Clampet going after Jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out. 
 I purchased this book on the recommendation of a woodworking magazine writer I have come to respect.  Though the book is on architecture I can see how many of the principles apply to furniture making as well.  I understand what this author is saying, but sometimes thought that his geometric "hidden" relationships were somewhat stretched.  I think I could probably do the same thing with any building if I looked at it long enough.  It sometimes felt like a real tough read for me (it certainly helped me go to sleep many nights).  Given this book appears out of print and he hefty price I paid for it, I would certainly look elsewhere if you are coming from the same direction I came from on the purchase.  An understanding of the golden ratio, shadow lines and looking at some classic pieces (shaker, federal, etc.) will probably yield equal or better benefit to your own furniture design making.  Though out of my league, I would stretch to say the same exact thing to an architect 
 I normally like warm, sensual-type perfumes, but I wanted to try something different for a change.  I liked the fact that this is advertised as subtle and not perfumey.  Well...I have to disagree.  I think it is VERY perfumey and not subtle at all. To me it has a very sharp, high-toned scent which is almost acrid. I thought at first that maybe I had sprayed too much on, so I tried just a little spritz.  Still VERY strong and sharp. And I agree with the comparison to dead flowers and dryer sheets.  I will definitely not be ordering this again.  
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 Negotiating Rationally seemes promising but falls short.  It provides food for thought on the interface between distributive and integrative bargaining and on biases that get in the way of a good solution.  But as a framework for negotiation, Negotiating Rationally is inadequate.  Getting to Yes is a far better structure and is easier to understand -- both for the novice and the experienced negotiator 
 Maybe it was the editing or the translation, but this book was a long and frustrating waste of time.    There was no spark in the writing, plot or characters.  It was as if everyone was either on Prozac or needed it!  I was really let down because the middle started getting more interesting so I kept reading, thinking it would finish strongly, but was disappointed.  Actually, the only reason I am writing this is because I was taken in by the many 4 and 5 star ratings and am pissed off that I was duped!!   
 the recipies in this book are plain and uninspired.  they are also inexact.  in the recipie for Tuna Noolde Casarole it calls for a bag of pasta.  What type of pasta? How big a bag.  I put a 1 lb bag of egg noodles in and tried to put it in the recomended size container, didn't fit.  The sauce is also not nearly enough for the quantity (if you use 1 lb of egg noodles) 
 Even though this book wasn't expensive, it wasn't all I thought it was. It is mostly about hypertrophy and is totally geared to bodybuilding. The periodization part is usefull though 
 I read the book not because I'm a fan of detective fiction, but because I wanted to learn a bit more of the history of Jazz and New Orleans: Fulmer's book more than fulfilled my expectations. Now I want to read his latest book to see what additional glimpses of Jazz and New Orleans Fulmer describes in it.    A few have criticized Fulmer because he called St. Cyr a Creole. Their argument is that St. Cyr is partially black and Creoles are never even partially black.  However, they are wrong.  The true origin of the word Creole is Spanish. This was the name given to the descendant of a Spanish-born mother and father when their child was born away from Spain. Later the term Creole was also used by the French to indicate a person born away from France whose parent were both born in France.    The original Creoles were indeed not mixed.  However, the term Creole also has for some time been used as Fulmer uses it.  It is a name given to the mixed blood descendants of blacks and the original French and Spanish settlers.  Check your dictionary.    
 I have been a subscriber to TIME for over 15 years and before that a reader of my parents' subscription. It pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about. Frankly, the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack; such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters.  A newsweekly has the obligation to go beyond the newspapers--to use the extra couple days to provide a more balanced and analytical view. Unfortunately TIME fixes its editorial position at the beginning of a story--any future coverage is designed to prove TIME's initial position correct. The immediate taking of an editorial position is then carried into all future coverage of the event; stifling analysis and preventing any analytical development beyond the first few stories--"we told you so, we told you so." Even worse, the coverage of a lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens at which point the sensational event becomes the ultimate interpretation of the entire story. Can't the magazine occasionally admit it was wrong rather than turning its eye away from the story that continues to burn? Out of sight, out of mind is the mantra...  In fact, I sometimes debate whether the decline of this magazine mirrors or outpaces the general decline in our media; newspapers are failing, television news can't seem to get away from the gory or sensationalistic, even academic journals have specialized themselves into irrelevance. We seem to have a greater appreciation for comedy than analysis.  Neutrality is dead. Frankly, I don't care so much about any perceived editorial slant as I do about the fact that the magazine is increasingly boring and irrelevant. TIME used to have excellent coverage of trends and events outside of the United States--no more. Iran is building nuclear weapons but merits the occasional blurb on a world summary page. African states are making vast strides towards democracy, we get an article about Nigerian computer fraud. Russia is emerging from the turmoil of perestroika and its painful transition has much to teach about the costs and value of democracy, but we seem to focus only on the latest roadbomb in Iraq. Japan, one of the world's most influential cultures, in the week I originally wrote this review (see 12-month subscription) merited only a snippet regarding a royal marriage and an analysis of foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling. Somewhere in the wide world is a fascinating place or culture to which TIME could send a correspondent and bring the place and people alive to its readership, instead we get tabloid excrement in the nature of Joel Stein's puerile take on pornography and social deviants. But most damning is the fact that after reading TIME one asks: How in the hell did our world become boring?  Can TIME try emulating The Economist rather than The Enquirer? Someone needs to step in and restore the proud tradition of complete and in-depth coverage--educate the reader about the world in which we live; don't wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine the spotlight on any of the various cultures and countries in which real and interesting events take place every single week. TIME has the history and potential of being a five-star magazine, if only it would just focus on finding and reporting the news 
 Abraham Lincoln's law partner once wanted to read some maudlin poetry to Abe.  Once he was done, Lincoln said "The people who like this sort of thing will find it the sort of thing they like."  Beaches is fine.  It is obviously a chick flick.  Bette Midler has some real opportunities to sing.  The acting is good.  The problem is that the plot is so predictable 
 While "Riot Act" (2002) is probably the bands most strongest album yet, the tour that followed definitley was not.  Onstage Pearl Jam don't even look like themselves anymore, well at least on the 2003 tour. The deliverence and shoegazing performance leave so much to be desired, its only a worse follow on from the 2000 american tour where the band looked exhuasted and bored, after what looked like a pretty impressive previous European tour of the same year.  Probably the reason is that the band are't 21 anymore, and have become slack.  Hopefully with rehearsals, eating properly, and new inspiration they will make their next tour back to their best, and end this drudge which has made them look silly in recent times.  Don't buy this, their last decent tour was 1998 or Europe 2000, so one day hopefully we will see a DVD from those times or prior to that.  New album soon......... 
 lousiest 10 dollars i spent. the tips are already bent and thats at maybe 10 minutes or so of fooling around with it. ive tried it with multiple guitars and the effects and theres no such thing as this thing getting a "bow" effect. i dunno. scratchy. i dont recommend this at all. ive been playing the guitar for about 13 years now. 
 This book went too far into details of a persons sex life. I will give this book a zero rating. I wish I never bought the book. The only thing I will do with this book is burn it 
 I can fix this! This movie never happened. Now we need to make Starship Troopers 2. I will contribute a few bucks. If we all contribute, we can get an actual director to come along, preferably the one from the first movie, get us some big time sponsors, and make us one heck of a Starship Troopers 2! There, I have repaired the terrible tear in all our souls that this fake Starship Troopers 2 caused us all 
 I read this memoir in one evening, not because it is gripping (it is not) but because it is short.  I found myself praying that the shallow insights, endless banal metaphors, and self-absorbed ramblings of a privileged and narcissistic woman would finally lead to some useful insights.  Perhaps, I thought, the author will be magically transformed into someone with whom I could actually enjoy spending an hour. I was disappointed.  Joan Anderson writes of her own "journey of self-discovery."  She comes off as a whiny wealthy woman who has spent her adult life gazing at her reflection in her husband, her sons, her work, and her friends.  At the age of fifty, she does not like what she sees, or perhaps she simply doesn't want to recognize herself any longer.  She escapes to her second home on Cape Cod for a year to indulge herself and make herself the center of her world - with no petty distractions such as family, friends, community, or responsibilities.  In every person, task, tide, seashell, snowfall, seal, and grain of sand Anderson comes across, she again seeks (and finds) her reflection.  She spends this year creating metaphors for herself. (I think I counted five on one page!) and smugly congratulating herself for her now open and conscious self-absorption.  By the end of the year, she likes what she sees--so much so that she now offers workshops to help other women discover themselves.  Many women have found this to be a life-changing book.  I was not one of them.  Perhaps I just could not identify with Anderson, and I guess I'm a little relieved by this.   As the Kirkus review concludes, "A less-than-enthralling journey of self-discovery marred by more than a touch of self-congratulation."    Pass on this one 
 you no i thought he didnt need cash money or the hotboys till i heard this album bg my favorite anyway this album sucks if will ripe your guts out and feed them to you it was so bad i went into a depression cause i like the hot boys if they were still together gunit would be in alot of trouble and everbody else in the rap game 
 I admit that I have read every single one of Lilian Jackson Braun's "Cat Who" books. I used to relish every single one, but I agree with the other reviewers: Lately the books have been getting lamer and lamer.  I, too, think the books are now being ghost-written by someone else. I think the ghost-writing began about five or six books ago. It's not just that the mystery, never central, is now utterly an afterthought in these books. Nor is it that the resolution relies not on accute detective work on the part of Qwilleran or KoKo, but on deus ex machina. (Qwill and KoKo used to really sniff around, so to speak.) Nor is it that the style is mucher coyer than what Ms. Jackson Braun used to use. (I've had it with the endless references to the salt-and-pepper mustache already! It's getting to be a parody of itself!) No, the clincher is the many errors and inconsistencies in "The Cat Who Talked Turkey."   Someone has already pointed out that the Siamese take a car trip in perfect harmony in "The Cat Who Talked Turkey." We all remember that Yum-Yum howls whenever she's in the car. And what happened to taking KoKo out on the leash? And the last time we were privy to the love life of Gary Pratt, owner of the Black Bear Cafe, he was mourning a dead girlfriend. When did he pick up the wife who plays such a big role in this book?  The ghost writer not only hasn't read all the "Cat Who" books, s/he hasn't even done much research. In the book, Qwilleran wonders how KoKo could know something if he can't read. But the very first book posits that KoKo can read backwards. Remember the title of the very first book in this series? The ghost writer clearly doesn't!  Also, Eddington Smith's great-grandfather or grandfather is described as a pirate. But, in the original story, wasn't he a highwayman, instead?  The change in tone comes in the very first sentence when there's a quote from the "Qwill Pen": "A town without a bookstore is like a chicken with one leg." Now, the "Qwill Pen," while not exactly Art Buchwald, has never been this ridiculous.  I've been a faithful reader until now, but this book is the last straw. I suspect that there's not one ghost writer, but more than one, and that's why the books aren't just inconsistent with the real "Cat Who" books, but they don't really match each other, either. I hate to say it, but I'm finished with this series 
 With the "New Yorker" magazine article publication, it felt like Homes finally consummated numerous compelling revelations about her adoption and subsequent events. It's nonspecificity made her thoughts cosmopolitan and alluring. Her wretchedness seemed intolerable. Her fiction works had authentication.  Her book is the antithesis of sophisticated essay. The more explicit her details, the less the essence of her chronicle rivet the reader. Malevolence supplanted empathetic humanism.   Indubitably, Homes's adoption lacerated her intellect birthing her fiction.  A thank-you note will suffice.  30 years later, trying to ferret out the cipher from strangers & promiscuous documents is absurd. Her "imagining my mother" (page. 130, etc.) is fiction, not memoir. It diminishes the book 
 This movie is very weird and it makes you really dizzy. It shows you the end first and then shows you the events that lead up to it. Not a movie for children at all 
 Well, I have yet to buy this book out of principle, even though I am a huge Brooks fan, and own all his paperbacks. My problem with this release is that it was released in a Trade Size Paperback, rather then a Regular Sized Paperback. In fact, I am annoyed that I was not given a choice at lkeast on what size I would want to purchase. If the Publisher wants to get a few extra bucks out of fans by releasing a Trade Size Paperback, at least release the regular Trade Size Book so that the consumer can make the decision on what they want. Plus, for filing purposes, it is a pain to merchandise a trade size Book with all my Terry Brooks Regular Sized Books 
 I may be in the minority, but I think these books are absolutely horrible. My twin's teacher reads them to the kids at school, and my daughter loves them. She brought one home to read to me, and I was appalled. I think they are tasteless and have no redeeming value to them at all. The grammar is horrible (this is how Junie talks), and although I know it is suppose to be funny,  I just don't get it.  The subject matter is even worse. I think kids are too young to worry about boys, and I do not believe I want my kids reading books that are so mean spirited. With all the wonderful choices in children's literature, why choose this 
 Imagine that a novelist invents a world in which nearly anything can happen: characters in any work of fiction, published or unpublished, can walk this world freely, mingling with "real" people.  Plus, time travel is routine and meddling with the past is always threatening to destabilize the "present" in fantastic ways.  Plus, this world is not otherwise ours.  There was no World War II, for example.  And now imagine one final thing: the novelist is himself so apparently bereft of invention that virtually nothing happens in a given novel!  This is certainly the case in SOMETHING ROTTEN... I haven't read the author's previous three novels set in this world.  Other reviewers on these pages have speculated that, (1) either the author is "holding back" for future novels, or (2) has already completely run out of inspiration.   Hard to say.  The author's web page is a lot funnier than this novel, anyway.  Other problems: the main character, Thursday Next and her often non-existent husband Landen have no personality whatsoever; they are essentially holes in the page.  This is especially noticable when most of the other characters, even minor ones, are vividly drawn. Nor does the main character ever really do anything, other than fret constantly as to where she is going to find a babysitter.   Other problems: the humor is of that very mild, biteless, repetitive, linear, obvious sort  that I tend to think of as aimed at female readers.  What little satire there is comes out at  such a gentle, polite and ladylike level that one wonders why the author bothers. The policies of this novel's villain seem to be inspired by the real-world horrors of the Bush II administration, but the similarities really go nowhere. Similarly, the supposed attempt of the evil Goliath corporation to turn itself into a church not only goes nowhere, but isn't even taken seriously by the author himself.  Other problems: it may seem a lark to give all characters "comical" names along the lines of  Brik Schitte-Hawse or Jack Schitt, and it may even produce a mild smile on the reader's face the first time, but when the characters are mentioned on every page, the mild smile quickly turns into a grimace of misery.  It's like being trapped in a Ben Stiller movie.  Other problems: the book is illustrated, and the illustrations are primitive, unprofessional and inept.  The publisher's blurb says this whole mess is "more than a little wacky."  Well, even in a parallel universe, there's no "w" in "mainly pointless. 
 "Othello" is a play that will show you how unredeemable human beings can be.  It'll make you question everyone, along with his or her motives and beliefs.  It also shows you how men lusted after women in the late 16th century, but how women could not lust after men.  The double standard was put to the test, and, as always, women lose this battle.  Women may sell themselves as whores, and are ridiculed for it, but the men who use their services are overlooked.  This is a foul play and I think Shakespeare held women without regard. Othello was a despicable man who had little self-esteem I do not recommend 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 The images and text will make for nightmares. Not a fun one like "Where the wild things are." He is talented, just missed the mark on this one 
 I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.  Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing.   In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it

 Woods makes plenty of factual egregious errors. For instance, he does not discuss the "acquisition" of Indian land outside New England, or Massachussett's expulsion of Roger Williams for treating Indians with respect.   He omits any mention of Confederate atrocities during the Civil War, such as the massacre of black POWs by Nathan Bedford Forrest, or the CSA order to execute any officer in command of black troops. Nor is there any mention of Reconstruction violence and the systematic disenfranchisement of former slaves.  I could go on and on... though there were excellent parts I enjoyed (such as trust busting), the overall presentation made me very skeptical.   As an attorney, I can definitively state that his (highly selective) quotes and allusions to Supreme Court cases, and the Fourteenth Amendment are misleading and distorting to the point of being fiction 
 A bunch of junk.  Not any of the really meaty excersises.  An excuse for the auhor to make money 
 Not very well written. Its is simplistic & somewhat condescending. Later chapters tend to repeat basic concepts covered earlier without expanding upon the issues. There are more knowlegable authors out there that are refreshing and can effectively advance the your knowledge 
 Said's book has, sadly, been hugely influential on thousands of university students, their professors, and many living in the islamic world.  His book should not be read without concurrently reading Ibn Warraq's critique _Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism_.  Said lays the blame for nearly everything wrong in the islamic world  at the feet of the West, and thus helped entrench the culture of victimhood that feeds into suicide bombings and riots against political cartoons.  By authorin this book, Said confirmed his place in History as an irresponsible poseur in scholarly trappings 
 I purchased this book with the hope of getting some interesting stories and activities that I could use with my reluctant readers. I was disappointed that the stories, with few exceptions, were bland and uninviting. I was also disappointed with the activities accompanying the stories. All activities encouraged students to imagine a scenario like the one in the story and, using a litery device, write their own narratives. There are no sample essays, narratives, or stories for the students to look at as they begin their own writing. In fact, there are no student activities beyond the writing prompts. Overall, I was disappointed in the lack of innovation and variation in both the stories and the accompanying activities 
 This book will sucker you, and I don't mean that in a good way. It starts out as a hard-nosed, nicely-written discussion of what it means to help someone and the rewards and troubles that may ensue. The first half of the book presents a number-but not as many as the jacket blurbs would have you believe-of the philosophical conundrums of giving and receiving help; as a one-time teacher and recently-retired minister the author has had lots of personal and practical experience in the area. Then about halfway through the screen of objectivity starts to slip and the author's radical leftist colors begin peeking out here and there. By the last third of the book the text has become a confused, softheaded 'social liberation theory' polemic for some sort of a semi-Marxist utopia where, I guess, everyone devotes his or her existence to helping each other. This may be fine if you already believe that sort of thing, but the argument isn't convincing and to a more neutral reader it comes off like a rant. Heaven help the conservative who stumbles on this piece of work; the author has no help (or compassion) for him or her. Which is too bad because the original topic-the paradox of help-is worthy of any amount of reasoned discussion, and the author's nice writing (if you discount the usual self-centered boomer "I this... and I that..." style) draws you in. But the journey doesn't go to its advertised destintation, and I'd say spend your time and money elsewhere. 
 Get "Universe by Design" by Danny Faulkner or "Starlight and Time" by Russell Humphreys 
 First things last: Who's giving this record four and five stars?  I'm a big Ratt fan, all the way back to the E.P. But this just isn't a good album.  They'd resorted to outside writers by this point, because their main songwriter (Robbin Crosby) from their salad daze couldn't write killer songs anymore.  I always liked "One Step Away", but even that's a little too clean & polished for Ratt n'Roll.  Easily their worst full studio record of the five...  - cRAI 
 Doesn't address this model.  Just higher-end ones.  Waste of money 
 The book might be ok for a very young reader.  However, from the summary and from the other review, I thought the book would be helpful to a young person with a telescope (to help them find what's out there).  I just received the book today and am returning it because it will certainly not be useful in this way 
 The ones I received wouldn't lock anbd were bent. I need an address to return them and get a refund.  I don't have the receipt. 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 The PDVD170 Portable DVD Player CH-LDV 700B All Region Code / Zone Free 110/220 NTSC PAL (1) ] SUCKS! I can not get it to play ANY of my DVDs. Okay,  I got it to play 1 lousy photo disk. Big WHOOPEE, I didn't purchase this thing so I could only look at a ONE disk of photos.    The DVDs I tried to play on it were a wide range that easily play on my Panasonic DVD-LS5 unit, my Toshiba pc, and my Sanyo VHS/DVD players. I load them and they INSTANTLY play.   I tried brand new ones (fresh out of the box). I tried older ones,'homeburned', CDs and copies. NONE of them would play on this piece of garbage. They all work fine on my other electronic devices.   According to the manual - Page 19 - I quote: "Close the disc tray and the unit will automatically start playback of the disk." HA! The only disk it played back was a photo disk. I tried 12 different types of DVD, CD and photo disk. The ONLY one that worked was the photo. 1 out of 12 ARE  NOT good odds.   SO, I re-read the manual. On page 5 (and page 33) it says that this is a region 1 player (That's the ONLY type of media I attempted to use and NONE of it worked.) WHAT?  I bought this so I could play everything, from my region one to some imports I had planned on getting. Also, there are no codes in the manual so that you could change it from Region 1 to All Region code/Zone Free.    Oh and the DVD kept spinning half the time when the Disk Door was opened. Dangerous!   The only bright spot was how quickly I got this junk. I hope they refund me just as quickly.   --One VERY dissatisfied customer 
 I like that your child can draw in the tub but the crayons are constantly falling out of its holder.  They do not hold well and I have already lost quite a few crayons down the drain.  For the amount you spend on the actual item and then shipping, you are better off going to a store to purchase this item 
 And that's good news, of course, if you like video games.    But if you want a movie--even an action/adventure movie--this one isn't worth watching even once.    Between all the relentless barages of one-second meaningless images, however, they do manage to sandwich in some of the ethical issues concerning cloning, and surprisingly they present some of the pros and well as some of the cons.  For this, I give the movie two stars.   
 I was a little disappointed with this film. I know the name, and a fair amount of the material, but was hoping to gain some insight to the Man. Got some, but not much. Maybe a bit too esoteric for the curious. Much of the information was glossed over. There is mention of "The Lion King", and Prima's influence on contemporary rock n' roll, but there is never any further exploration of these topics. I wanted to know the thought process behind the deadpan delivery of Keely Smith's on-stage persona, as well as a host of other things, but was left high and dry... This is probably common knowledge to the fan "in the know". However, for the rest of us... The footage is fantastic, but I never felt I really got to know Louis Prima, or even his work, really. Isn't that the point? 
 This terrible movie has singing!  Bad singing, and lots of it!  Overacted, trite, and BORING!  All those good reviews, I thought it would be campy and cool, but it's NOT!  
 If you have already purchased the book "Eat Right 4 Your Type" you won't need this supplement as all the info is right there 
 After listening to phenomenon and then listening to this it's a white boys nightmare.  If your a wigger or like the rap crap this is ur stuff.  But for me it was garbage.  Glad to see TFK decided to change there ways after this cd.  Thank God 
 This is a disappointing book.  I had read a couple of Wilber's earlier books and liked them, especially the superb "Grace and Grit."  At his best, he can be very good at explaining a nondualistic Eastern style philosophy.  As the title suggests, this book is meant to introduce people to an all encompassing metaphysical system.  No one could attempt such an enterprise without a little hubris.  But why stop at a little?  Wilber is fond of dropping the names of long lists of famous intellectuals whose work he finds consistent with, but subservient to, his system.  Reality is sliced and diced in an endless taxonomy of levels, holons, stages, paradigm shifts, quadrants, centers, spheres and fulcrums before being reassembled into a nondualistic whole.  Anyone satisfied with scientific explainations is dismissed as a "reductionist" holding what he calls "an insane world view."  The science based world view is not so much argued against as it is insulted, dismissed and misrepresented.  The most remarkable thing in this book is it's bizzare description of neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory.  He makes the astonishing claim that very few theorists believe in Darwinian evolution and that, "There is no evidence whatsoever for intermediate (fossil) forms."  Wilber maintains it would take at least a hundred simultaneous beneficial mutations for something like a wing to evolve.  He claims this would have to occur separately in both a male and a female who would then have to mate successfully.  This is a grotesque caricature of Darwinan theory.  Anyone who thinks it is adequate should buy this book.  Others should read Richard Dawkins "Climbing Mount Improbable."  Wilber never names any scientists who advocate this version of evolution for the very good reason that there aren't any.  What accounts for this straw man caricature of the most foundational scientific theory in modern biology?  Well, Darwinian theory predicts that two species competing for the same niche will compete very fiercely.  Wilber's Hegelian style spirit based pantheism competes with a science based pantheism in the tradition of Spinoza, Darwin and Einstein.    This book is written in a question and answer format.  I bought it on audio cassette.  The questions were read by a young woman.  Her tone indicates she is struggling to understand.  She is always co-operative and eager to receive the wisdom from on high.   The answers are read by a man.  His tone is authoritative and patiently condescending.  This is perfect for the text.  Here is a one sentence sample, from the book, of Wilber's writing at it's worst:  "So we have some very popular theorists who, tired of the burdens of postconventional and world-centric rational perspectivism, recommend a regressive slide into egocentric vital impulsive polymorphous phantasmic emotional revival."   Like Hegel, Wilber has attracted legions of readers who assume that his most incomprehensible writing must be his most brilliant.  If you are willing to make that assumption, this book will delight you 
 This book was a real disappointment to me.  Unlike "The Table Saw" book by Kelly Mehler, which is great - this router book is poorly written, poorly organized, and poorly illustrated.  If you're looking for a book to explain router basics, this isn't it.  The book appears to be a collection of rather advanced articles written for a woodworking magazine, cobbled together (poorly) with a few intro chapters slapped on the front.  After the lousy intro chapters, for example, the next one is on how to build your own router bit case.  A nice little advanced project for the experienced woodworker, but hardly an appropriate "first project."  The first half of The Table Saw book, in contrast,  very clearly explains and shows you how to set up the full variety of basic cuts, and discusses the pros and cons of the techniques.  Not this one, it'll leave you totally guessing.  While I may not be a veteran woodworker, I know a good how-to book when I see one, and how valuable one can be if done at least reasonably well.  This book fails on all counts 
 My 2 year old son got this for Christmas last year and was initially very excited because he loves music.  However the piano has a very tinny sound and doesn't even come close to a real piano sound.  Also the stool and piano legs have to be tightened often and can come off quite easily 
 I bought this book because I am a Kellerman fan and usually enjoy his work.  This one is far below his usual quality!  The characters are poorly developed and, by the end of the book, I really didn't care what happened to any of them.  There are a bunch of contrived coincidences, which are simply ludicrous and insulting to the reader.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 NOTE: Watch out - the batteries blow up, when used with the AC adaptor !   So, what is the point of plopping down $500 for this radio - there is not much of interest on shortwave anymore, one can buy a $25 Radio Shack model 12-898 digital PLL AM/FM radio for AM DXing (THE E1 DOESN'T EVEN HAVE AN INTERNAL FERRITE-BAR ANTENNA, OR COME WITH A SATELLITE ANTENNA !), and one can buy a satellite radio for $50, now. Also, after getting $500 in-the-hole, one gets to shell out a monthly fee for satellite radio, plus an activation fee - a bigger ripoff than cable T.V. ! Evidentually, there are major technical problems with the actual satellites, so its future is in question !   So, what is the bottom-line ? Well let's see, $500 for the radio, probably another $100 - $200 for the AM and satellite external antennas, $9 - $12 monthly fee, and the activation fee. Is this another blunder by Grundig/Eton/Tecsun, or a total ripoff - I suspect a bit of both ! So, $500 for a receiver that does not even receive/process IBOC for AM/FM, or DRM for SW !  This baby, I believe, is assembled in India, while the rest of the Grundig/Eton/Tecsun junk is made in China. I wonder, if the E1 is as cheap as, the Grundig S350 ?  This is a copy of a post from gearlog.com (the BBC and "Voice of the Andes" are now gone, too):  Shortwave Eton E1 Posted by: Larry N.  Monday, October 31, 2005 8:03 PM  David,   I am shocked your would recommend this new radio from Eton.  Honest?, DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS WRONG WITH IT? It does not have Digital Radio Mondale! Who in 2005/2006 would spend $500.00 for a top of the line portable without it? In few years the shortwave part of this radio will be useless. DW is leaving analog shortwave by June 2006. Radio New Zealand by the end of December 2006.   I would hope you would admit your mistake and if not withdrawing your recommendation at least make note of the lack of Digital Radio Mondale and why that is important!   73  Larry  
 This book says the big problem with the Dems is they have no ideas.  OK so far.  They point out how the Repubs have put together a vast machine, involving think tanks, training centers, a right wing media, and coordinated messaging.  Yup, that's true.  They point out that the Dems not only have no ideas, but they run their campaigns in fundamentally wrong ways, such as going to the same few consultants, concentrating on a few states and a few races and not running nationally...dead right.  But...in more than 200 pages, I can't find a single idea.  Not one.  They keep saying that there's hope, that the Democrats can work this out, can become the majority party again.  But they don't give a single clue as to the ideas that would lead us there.  Don't buy this book.  Buy Joe Klein's book.  Better read, and what is good in this one is pretty much in that one 
 This is another Family friendly movie, that my 3 littlest ones just didn't take to.  About have way through, 2 of the 3 were asking to put on Homeward bound instead.  There was a lot I liked about this movie, but my family voted with their feet and remote control.  They are 6 to 10 years old 
 i used to follow politics but now i know better. clinton is a hero to poor folk in the US only bc bush is such a nazi, sorry, but clinton did more than any pres in US history to cut welfare to the moms who need it the most! i ain't no fool partisan of a richmans party and i don't like america. and yes i'm born and raised in the US, there is no democracy here, only a moneycracy!!! power to the ppl lets make a real country for the ppl, not the capitalist leech scum!! 
 The Spanish Civil War has been called the most lied about event of the 20th Century.  Capa's photographs are powerful, but just another addition to the long line of western artists and intellectuals who surrendered their  minds and talents to the service of Stalin and the Comintern during the  1930s.  It is a shame that the myth of the good "republican"  cause in Spain continues to be perpetuated 
 This book was so different from the usual NR story.  The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic.  If you want romance, skip this.  It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up 
 There's nothing special about her. She has blonde hair and tanned skin, making her look slightly awkward. Honestly, I would suggest On Ice Dana, who is easily the prettiest out of the lot. Her clothes are simple too 
 With so many good books out there just waiting to be explored, why would anyone read Norman Mailer?  This book is a testament to the author's own arrogance, and we the reader are forced to suffer through all its self-indulgent twists and turns.  Don't read books by this neanderthal.  He's way past his prime.  Actually, he never was in his prime.  All of his books are equally dreadful.  So let's put Mailer's books in the trash bin where they belong.  Haven't we had enough of these writers who write and publish by hubris alone?  Go away Mailer, your time us up 
 I read this book only because it was lent to me by an unfortunate person who was lumbered with it for Mothers Day. It was the only BTB book I've read since "Woman of Substance" and I fine it hard to believe that it was written by the same writer! The dialogue was unbelievably twee and some of it was out of a Victorian novel---the heroine calls her brother --Brother mine!!!!!Oh brother! I finished it because it was so bad that it was funny 
 The pictorial examples of of Quilts in Bloom are beautiful. However, very little of the book is devoted to techniques and they are pretty basic. From the cover I would have expected more intricate patterns included that play off the images of the quilts in the book. There are many, many more books on this subject that have more to offer. Glance through it and leave it at the store (or website). 
 Having read some of the other reviews, I have gathered that this was not the best book to introduce the reader to Saul Bellow. Unfortunately, this is my first attempt at reading Bellow. At the very beginning, I was very impressed with his vivid description of people and their situations. However, some 20-30 pages into the book I began to wonder when the descriptions would end and some kind of story would begin. Perhaps I am just not used to Bellow's style of narrative, but I found this one very hard to get through, despite its very short length. Somewhere down the line I may attempt to read more by Bellow, but at this point it's not real high on my list of priorities 
 For those that but purely on reading reviews - be warned. Watch it before buying. I found this to be a hyped-up pretentious mess. Exceedingly dull and frankly, annoying 
 I studied the early writings of Mr. Hillman, as a student in Vermont. He was once a real genius, original and gutsy if more incomprehensible. Then, some editor got him to "make sense" And in the Soul's Code, I  suppose he did, in a pablum-ish way. But this book? I couldn't make nor  head nor tails of its structure or meaning. Where o where did the gods put  this man's genius? Or rather, what price was he willing to take to his  great writing to render this mess? Well, because he is a great author in  the past, i cannot give him one star. But for anyone else, i'd give this  none 
 There is NOTHING of science in this sliver of a book.  This book Summed up:  You must think Rich Use thought to bring form to the formless Thank god so it will occur. When it doesn't occur, you either weren't thankful enough to god or failed to think hard enough about being rich. PURE SCIENCE!    I could understand someone in 1910 being impressed by this work, along with maybe animal-magnetism or iridology, but only a half-wit would be compelled by any of this today 
 In my library of screenwriting books, this was unfortunately the least helpful.   If you're a beginning screenwriter, read Robert McKee, Linda Seger, Christopher Vogler, and Syd Field.  Then don't waste anymore time  reading books on screenwriting.  Just sit down and do it.   When you've got  a completed draft, read Lerch's "500 Ways" and Flinn's "How  NOT to Write a Screenplay", before you actually submit the script  anywhere. Good luck 
 So whose brilliant idea was it substitute Jean Reno's trademark french accent with a bloody yank's?  What a total let down, the entire appeal of this bloke is his gruff, natural french accent and to trade it off with a yankie accent is beyond comprehension. Idiots.  Ray Duncan Australia. 
 Yes, the artwork is clever and cute.  But, this book, while it has some good information, is also laced with very negative statements that can frighten a child.  It is meant to be humerous - but it is very negative.  You judge: here are examples: "...my cousin got a cavity once and he cried and cried like a baby.  Well, Bubba molar, a cavity can be painful."  "common reactions to cavities - shock, panic, depression, self pity, fear (a hole, I am afraid of holes), anger (lousy bacteria), blame, denial..."  "take out our toothbrushes and floss and clean ourselves up - sorry, the dog ate my toothbrush, brushing is for sissies, i'm allergic to toothpast, who has time to brush"  what lunch is "3 pieces of cake please and pie" "yuck I don't like olives"  "a bad dentist skips work to play golf and sends his brother the construction worker to take his place - it looks like we will have to clear out a few of this teeth"  So, with the text peppered with objectional negativity, I cannot recommend this book.  
 I ordered these as a Christmas gift, and although they were ordered before the "Holiday guaranteed shipping deadline", they still arrived a few days after Christmas. Also, when they did arrive, they were packed so poorly in the box that one of the crocks was cracked in half. I ended up finding the same exact crocks at a local department store for a lower cost. As much as I've loved the books, electronics, DVD's, etc, that I order from Amazon, I will never order these knowing that the packaging will not get it here in one piece. It was a complete disappointment 
 If you have had to take out a mortgage to buy a house, have ever purchased life insurance or have a retirement account, this book will seem extremely basic. There aren't really any tools, worksheets or practical plans here. The book is simply a series of "Tips" -- very brief articles from different financial planners. It's a readable format, but there's not much meat.  For example, the section on "Software for Staying Organized" includes mention of only 3 software products, two of which are Microsoft Money and Intuit Quicken. The author starts her comments saying "The basic/standard versions are entry-level products designed for people new to personal finance software" (My experience with the basic versions of those programs is that they include quite powerful analysis and budgeting tools).    If you're just starting out or really need a primer, this is a readable book and comes well recommended. But if you are reasonably literate in working with lenders and insurance companies, you'll find this too simple 
 On this recording Joni Mitchell sounds like she's singing in a bad piano bar. Never thought she'd be a lounge singer. I've listened to this CD only once because I want to remember her as the Joni Mitchell of the sixties and seventies 
 Danielewski is a little like "musician" Puff Daddy: he really does very little work on his own but is an expert at appropriating ideas from the avant-garde and then rearranging them in a comfortable, easily consumable form. "House of Leaves" has more in common with Stephen King than it does with Ballard, Burroughs, Poe, or even more radical artists who use the methods MD steals, like Samuel R. Delaney.  If having to turn a book while you read seems "cutting edge" or "daring" to you, then jump in. Otherwise, you should go buy some Jeff Vandermeer of China Mieville -- two artists less concerned with empty stylistic tricks and more focused on producing quality literature 
 I barely got through the first few chapters. There is no doubt the author knows Tolkien, but the writing will lose you quickly 
 This is one of the worst books that I was required to read for my MBA program. I didnt benefit anything from reading the book. The authors of this book should not be considered "authors", and people should be paid to read such a book!!  When you read the book, you will understand what I say (if you have to read it). The Authors think that readers are coming from the moon or maybe Mars, and that they don't know the clear obvious in their life 
 The foundation of success in a horror story is a strong, original beginning.  The author must grab your attention and earn your suspension of disbelief.  Dean Koontz failed to make this upfront investment in The Taking.  The story caroms off of a long series of hackneyed horror elements - stormy night, body snatchers, magic mirrors, ghouls, and (Koontz's favorite) Delphic dogs - before settling down with a very modest storyline about a non-denominational rapture.    Koontz can usually be counted on to deliver some pleasant thrills or humor if not the chills of real horror.  But The Taking provides no such return 
 Author writes many "how to books" and changes the title. No real world information. I did however, run into a webstie called turnkeyparlor that contained excellent info and helped me get my parlor open. The Ben & Jerry's books is also a good one as far as recipes, but not helpful in opening a parlor business 
 This is a made for TV movie and not the original film. Do not waste your money on this re-make. Buy the original that was released in 1967 and starred Robert Blake 
 I have yet to receive this book. Insofar as it was advertised as being available, why all the delay? I do hope my credit card has not been debited for this transaction as it is now one month and there is still no book. I will probably buy my books in a book store from here on.

 No longer intended to be a comprehensive reference, the Guinness Book is now a sort of compilation of interesting superlatives with oversized pictures and many features that aren't even actual records ("Most Overrated Celebrity").  If you're going to do this, why not offer one edition that plays it by the book?  So dies a noble institution 
 This is a very odd movie, which Leonard Maltin amusingly calls financial science fiction. Director Alan J Pakula is in one of his paranoid conspiracy theory moods a la Parallax View and All the Presidents Men, and as Jane Fonda's IPC company produced it, she thinks she's doing The China Syndrome. Apparently international currency is dependent on the Saudi Arabians whose ownership of oil makes them the richest people in the world. When they contemplate investing in gold rather than lending their wealth to support the banks, wall street fears a new world depression. This all sounds very scary until one wonders if the Arabs bankrupt everyone, what good will the gold be? One also wonders how seriously we are to take this when Pakula casts Kris Krisofferson, sans beard, as a banking troubleshooter! Casting Fonda as a former movie star who gave up her career to marry money is kind of prophetic consider her future marriage to Ted Turner. We aren't given a clue as to what kind of actress her character was, but the way Fonda is styled and lit suggests Joan Crawford, so then we can free associate Crawford with Pepsi and Al Steele. Whatever suspense Pakula is trying for is ruined by an awful music score by Michael Small, and the romance between Kristofferson and Fonda doesn't work either. Kristofferson is laughable as a he-man, and there is something icky in the idea that this is the kind of behaviour that Fonda responds to. There is also the unfortunate coincidence of their matching hairstyles - it recalls Lily Tomlin and John Travolta in Moment by Moment. One curiosity is the kind of computer software used at the time 
 Yes, All the King's Men is one of the 5 greatest American novels, for all the reasons people here cite, and more.  But this is not that novel.  It is a piece of junk unjustly cadged together with manuscript fragments that one of America's greatest writers never wrote in this form.  Despite decades to do so, in a life of over 90 years.  A very careful,writer, scholar, and teacher too.  This edition is a gratuitous insult to his memory and a dangerous precedent in American letters.  The public should not countenance it.  It doesn't matter if one paragraph or one sentence only is changed.  Indeed one single word can change a whole book, as the recent restoration of Ulysees has proven.  But that was justified because of:  (1) an copyist's error that persisted for decades; (2) poor Joyce was blind.  No such excuse exists here for putting in words that Robert Penn Warren cut out.  Any writer knows that cutting is as important as writing.  And certainly do not believe the ridiculous lie about the editor supposedly goofing with Warren's intention.  For one thing, that was a conversation with a live man, who agreed and thereafter forever let it stand.  And who certainly (several Pulitzers and every other literary award this country has to offer) eventually possessed the clout to "fix it" if he wanted to.  Truth be told, this lie can be used to alter just about any book published in the last 200 years -- and so much easier after you die.  For whatever reason they may like to.  For decades, the community of American literary scholars has painstakingly put together a set of rules to govern the correction of texts, and the publication of manuscripts posthumously -- always to reflect the last and best intention of the author based on the evidence.  For after death, this can be the only aim and only ethical endeavor.  In America today, everything is now subject to fakery.  Movies contain ads, even "news broadcasts" have product signs pasted in by computers.  Such is our brave new world, even more tawdry than Huxley envisioned. This edition of a classic is a blatant attempt to prostitute our very cultural heritage.  If they can do this to Penn Warren's masterpiece, they can do it to anybody.  That is the book industry's message.  That, plus a shameless attempt to pitch something "new" to go with the movie.  It is especially ironic and doubly disgusting that this has been done to a book which has, as a major theme, vulger hucksterism and its dubious wages.  The word left out of Ulysees, by the way, was "love."  The word invisibly yet indelibly seeped into this bogus imposture, on every page, is "garbage."  Just say no 
 The authors base their claims on extremely doubtful sources such as missionaries who obviously have a clear interest in telling a victimized story. I had a lot of hopes but was unfortunately utterly disappointed. It seems that the authors are too biased and lack any sort of impartiality in presenting the facts of the turbulent time period in question. Too bad.. 
 Daniel Pipes does not disappoint here at all.  He is a man on a mission making the most of recent events to make sure non-Muslim World turns and remains paranoid of all Muslim groups and nations.   What makes his kind of scholarship particularly devious is the fact that he is well armed with facts and figures that he uses very selectively and has carved himself a pseudo-academic position.  Though in this book even his usual rather thin veneer of fake objectivity has been thrown away.  His naked dislike of most things Muslim is scary.  Even scarier is how many consider him to be the voice of reason and truth.  The title suggests that USA is about to be overrun and destroyed by thousands of Muslim militants who have penetrated our society.  It is a call for "Jihad" in a way.  According to Pipes, only good Muslim is the one who has denied his religion and culture.  While any influence of Islam on politics of any kind is evil, the same criteria does not seem to apply to other religions.  While he urges all "good" Muslims to organize against the extremism, he also categorizes any Muslim organization as a likely front for extremist ideologies.  He seems to have a particular dislike of those groups who have been critical of US Middle East policies.  The fact is Islamic extremists in USA do not even register as a threat to this country.  The political influence of mainstream Muslims in USA, though numbered in millions, let alone extremists among them, is negligible.  There is no measurable internal threat from American Muslims as the author strongly suggests.  The irony and hypocracy of this deeply and militantly Zionist author extolling the virtues of disengaging religious zealotry from politics seems to have been lost on many readers.   Far beyond analysis, Pipes pretty much dictates what exactly everybody should be doing to counter this menace of Islam.  His audacity to lecture UN, US presidents, other World leaders and bodies in the pages of this book is just breath taking.  It is no wonder that Pipes almost completely focuses his wrath on Iran and Iraq (book written before the start of Iraq war), the two states in the region in a position to threaten ambitions of Israel.  One would think if Global "Islamic" terrorism were the main concern, Pipes would focus our attention more on Saudi Arabia which exports and finances some of the most extreme Islamic ideologies around the World.  None of the 9/11 terrorists were Shiites.  Pipes tries to make us believe that source of terrorism are theological, somewhere in the Islamic culture if not in Islamic teachings themselves.  He laments the attempts at politicization of Islam, while he is not disturbed at all by other ethnic or religious based regimes in the region.     This book is highly one-sided and represents a bigoted interpretation of not just the causes but also the scale of the dangers Islamic(?) terrorism presents to the rest of the World.  Pipes offers not a way out but a way to deepen the crisis in service of his ideology and causes. 
 Zero stars, for a product not yet out. (5 for a great series though)While a few of the initial reviews, or should I say PREviews listing episodes, are informative, none of these writings here really do me, or most consumers any good, SINCE THIS ITEM HAS NOT YET BEEN RELEASED! Amazon does the average consumer a disservice in printing these glowing, drooling reviews before we have seen the product - quality, the ACTUAL episodes released, packaging, possible defects (like the Magnum series & Maiden's last Live DVD, both featured defective sections...) when the product IS released, I will have to wade through 7 (as of Oct 3) B.S. PRE-views in order in order to gain actual product knowledge before buying... These PRE'S, are presented by: fans? Industry Sales schmucks? Amazon employees? Who knows, pre-buyer beware...   
 By 1968 Julie Andrews was one of the most-loved performers of stage and screen, the original Eliza Doolittle of Broadway's MY FAIR LADY, a Best Actress Oscar winner for MARY POPPINS, and the star of film version of THE SOUND OF MUSIC--a movie that was so profitable Hollywood wags dubbed it "The Sound of Money."  20th Century Fox wasted little time in developing a new property for their new star, and (possibly under the influence of FUNNY GIRL, the great stage success that was set to film at about the same time) reached back in time to tell the story of a theatrical legend: Gertrude Lawrence.  It seemed like a winner.  Gertrude Lawrence (1902-1952) was known as "The Toast of Two Continents" in an era when the term had an almost literal meaning, and the highs and lows of her extremely public private life were almost as dramatic as her career. Operating with an incredibly large budget and under the direction of Robert Wise, the bio-pic STAR! seemed to have everything: lavish sets, incredible costumes, a truly great collection of songs, an epic running time, and--of course--Julie Andrews.  What more could you want?  Well, an interesting movie would be nice.  STAR! opened with tremendous fanfare in 1968 and proved an instant fiasco.  All the earnings of THE SOUND OF MUSIC were wiped out seemingly overnight, and with bankruptcy staring it in the face 20th Century Fox cut the film from three to two hours and rushed the film into general release as THOSE WERE THE HAPPY DAYS.  As a result, the film holds the dubious distinction of being the only major Hollywood film to completely tank twice in major theatrical release.  At the time, much of the film's failure was laid at the feet of Julie Andrews.  Gertrude Lawrence, her remarkable career, and her high-flying lifestyle were still well-recalled in 1968, and Julie Andrews simply did not look, walk, talk, sing, or in any way, shape or form bear any resemblance to her.  Seen today, however, this seems an unfair accusation; it is very evident that the project was never intended as a recreation of Lawrence, and Julie Andrews is actually quite good within the very tight limitations imposed upon her.  The real problem is the script, which goes nowhere at a slow crawl.  Indeed, the single most dramatic event in the entire story is Lawrence's financial bankruptcy!  Yes, you can enjoy the sights and sounds of STAR!  But the story is beyond boring: it makes you feel that you're sinking slowly to the bottom of a sea of Jello.  The DVD has been criticized for leaving out the few minutes of intermission material that accompanied the original release; frankly, I can't see this as anything more than a mercy, for the less time spent here the better.  As for the bonuses, they are okay--which is to say that they are actually more interesting than the film itself.  I'll be generous and give it two stars for production values and musical numbers.  But unless you are a diehard Julie Andrews fan, do yourself a favor and give STAR! a miss.  GFT, Amazon Reviewe 
 Looks like cute little bunnies on my fridge, but they're just eye candy.  Shakers don't store a lot of salt or pepper.  Handles are too small to comfortably hold, and it's hard to detect any salt and pepper coming out.   
 I found this movie to be quite bad: Montgomery Clift didn't act, he simply frowned throughout, showing barely any other emotion. The dialogue was trite, the suspense contrived, many of the scenes irrelevant, some of the action, especially the climax, unbelievable, and much of the direction obviously self-conscious and manipulative. The actors sounded like they were reading script lines and not speaking and moving the way human beings would in many of the story's situations.   Even the principle of religious confession in this story seemed hollow because the killer showed neither repentence nor a willingness to reform--which made him a continued menace to society. Is a priest supposed to shield such a murderer from prosecution on the grounds of "client privilege" while the rest of society remains vulnerable to the killer's next possible murder? What kind of religion is this? The priest didn't even preach to him about the evil of killing and the necessity of accepting punishment for such irresponsible behavior, as a means of reformation and of ultimately becoming worthy of God's forgiveness, grace and the eternal kingdom.   This principle of penance was beautifully exemplified in the movie "The Mission," as Robert DeNiro, playing the part of a mercinary killer, realized the error of his ways and painfully performed penance for his killings ; he not only accepted responsibility for his actions, considering them terribly wrong, but showed a determination to never repeat them; he himself then became a good priest and helped jungle natives live a better, more useful life. This character was worthy of forgiveness and absolution--a far cry from what the O.E. Hasse murderer displays in "I confess". Any priest who defends an unrepentent murderer from justice becomes as guilty of the murder as the murderer--even worse--because he risks the lives of other members of society. He in fact becomes a co-conspirator!  And the killer, in the last scene, murdering his wife in broad daylight--to silence her from revealing his crime--while police officers are standing all around him? What would that accomplish? He would undoubtedly get convicted of this crime and either receive a sentence of life in prison or the death penalty.   C'mon, give me a break! My name isn't Bozo 
 atl has been falling a lot this year. not only are the fools d4l stealing cash but so is this lame rap group dem franchize boyz. they think theyre so cool cuz their name is DEM franchiZe boyZ instead of them franchise boys but really no one but dumb and helpless teenagers that happen to enjoy this cd. their music is lame, sorry ifi  offended you, but thats a fact, their beats are wack, lyrics are lame, one positive is that they dont rap about fu*king candy bars...whats next, d4l is gonna call thier music wrapping? anyways, about dfb, just about everything about thier music is lame. the only good song is the i think they like me one because of da brat. otherwise theres probably better rap acts in nebraska then these fools. go get some t.i., luda, shawnna, or da brat 
 Even being a brief book, the writer accomplished the hard task of turning Joan's life into a sometimes boring narrative. Anyway, if you're looking to start knowing the basics, this is a good book to start.  The chpater at the end where the writer spent time writing about dramatization in books and movies about Joan's life is utter useless, in my opinion is totally desnecessary and the worst part of hte book.  Also, do not expect detailed accounts of the battles 
 This film should have lasted about twenty five minutes. The only real action that occured in the movie would probably play out at about that length. I am no action movie junkie, but In the Bedroom left me desperate for the credits to roll up, just so I could see something move. It is a film filled with talent, from the cast to the crew. But despite that, it loses itself in mood. While I did feel the angst that the characters felt in this film, it simply went on too long. Silent, anesthetized, and gruesomely meticulous, the film had no heartbeat. There was no effort to invest the viewer. In time, it became nothing more than annoying. I stopped sympathizing with the characters, and started desperately desiring a finale. It wasn't a terrible film, but it was a disappointment. All the awards it was nominated for had me expecting something much more powerful and significant; it left me merely drained 
 Quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book. Hopefully they will remake the movie soon, because the technical capabilities back in 1966 did not do the novel any justice 
 I am a long-time Austen fan-though not one of Stephanie Barron, whose footnotes I find endlessly annoying.  I found myself wanting to throw this novel away halfway through, when Hatty was being falsely accused of all that nonsense. Blah, blah, blah. I decided to persevere, and found it interesting, though as others remark, too, too Dickensian. But that ending!!!  WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?  What a let-down!  Ending up with Godwit? Pullease!  It certainly made Camber look even more an idealistic fool than before.  And that letter with the reference to Hatty dying young--why even include that?  We all would rather just have her drift away as part of that time period without being forced to contemplate mortality.  And why  that letter from the present anyway?  Takes away all the 18th Century, pre-Regency atmosphere.  Unnecessary and stoopid 
 My husaband had them for only a month before they came unsewn at the toes. Not a small hole but it went all the way across. And in both shoes. Not put together right. Very disappointed. To much money to fall apart!!!!!!! 
 The ideas behind 15 minutes aren't bad at all. Take one Robert DeNiro, put him in New York, mix him with some American-dream hunting Eastern Europeans on a killing spree, and try to provoke some emotions, and have a sly dig at the American justice system. Lets see...nothing happened...only repulse.  If, like everyone else, you plan on watching this film because DeNiro is in it, you will be dissapointed. He puts in a tired performance, almost as if he knows the film is a load of B.S. The attempt to be hard-hitting goes horribly wrong, instead it's just repulsive over the top violence, and its pointless...naked prostitute gets hacked to pieces, why? There are ways to create provoking films with such violence but they have to have meaning, such as 8mm (the horrible subject of snuff movies, hard-hitting meaningfull film), 15 minutes is far from meaningfull. We all know there are some deranged psychopaths out there doing just that, but when converting it to a film, it needs a deeper meaning, otherwise it turns into melodramatic Hollywood [...].  If you like brain-dead gore and violence, lack of plot and cringing melodrama. Go ahead 
 I flip through Time every now and again at the barber shop.  Sometimes there are good bits that they are using to keep the interest of people who want progressive social change, people who are sick of the power of the corporate elite and the violence of our militarists.   For the most part, since Time receives most of its revenues from Big Business advertisements, it can't challenge the establishment as it needs to. So instead I read magazines like Z, Utne, Mother Jones, The Progressive, The Sun, Earth Island and the New Internationalist 
 I used this maybe 4 times when the "in" stopped functioning, but it mysteriously *would* work in reverse.  I wish I read other people's reviews on this before I bought it. Horrible waste of money 
 I have collected autographs through the mail since 1975 and have introduced many to this wonderful hobby.  Bought first edition of this book in 1980. Should have stopped there. Waited a few more editions.  With ever-increasing postage costs, it is so important for the collector to have the most direct and up-to-date addresses available, ones that will help them "reach the stars," not the circular file of some movie company's PR dept or even worse, result in a letter being "RETURNED TO SENDER."  And Levine is notorious for listing many fan club addresses for these celebrities. All five of Levine's address books I have purchased have consistently provided the worst response percentages of any other source I have used.   The best of the printed Celebrity Address Lists (with the exception of Jim Weaver's) have long since disappeared in the advent of the Internet.  There are so many sites with current, tested addresses.  Don't waste your money on this one.  I don't even think Michael Levine knows how bad this is.  
 Don't buy this equipment unless you have two very strong people who are expert mechanics. Other exercise equipment comes partially assembled, this just has alot of odd pieces.  Complaint: 1) No "how to assemble" video as other brand names include. 2) Instruction sketches are small and diagrams are vague. 3) It took hours of painstaking trial and error to assemble, and we ended up leaving one washer out because once assembled, it cannot be diassembled. If I had known what a giant project this would be to assemble , I would never have purchased it.  This is Tony Little product is not an assembly friendly exercise machine, which Body By Jake products usually are. How much more would it have cost them to put in a a "how to" assembly video? I'll never buy a Tony Little product again.  That said, it's very simple to use.  Since this is the heavy duty model, it's heavy to move, and it takes up alot of space. It's a type of exercise equipment that needs its own large space. If you have a small room, think twice about this model. Millie in Californi 
 It doesn't provide details on how to value intangibles. It promotes a stock approach for intangible asset measuring but lacks the comprehensiveness of methodologies that use a flow approach. I didn't find this much help in my line of work as a business manager for a multinational organisation. I needed more practical examples and found the arguments weak and unsubstantiated. There seemed to be a lack in practical application and his arguments seemed not to be tested 
 Gotta wonder who puts these compilations together???   Perhaps 3 cool songs. Do yourself a favor and buy Vol. 1, 3, 5, and 7 instead 
 After some investigative reporting by the media, it was discovered that this alleged "true story" of a Holocaust survivor was anything but. The facts? Binjamin Wilkomirski is actually Swiss-born Bruno Grosjean Doessekker, and his experience was about as real as that of the supposed "fellow survivor" who corroborated his story, Laura Grabowski.  How did Grabowski play an indirect role in unmasking the author? She claimed to be an orphan who suffered torture at the hands of Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele and was later adopted by an American couple, only to have these stories be exposed as equally untrue (her childhood photos show a happy, healthy American girl w/not even hints of the emaciated sate commonly associated w/those who spent time in concentration camps). Additionally, she was revealed to actually be Lauren Stratford, author of the equally fictitious-but-presented-as-a-true-story "Satan's Underground", which detailed her alleged involvement in Satanism and the sexual abuse she endured from the time she was a young girl (something she'd also had a history of lying about since her late teens); as it turns out, "Grabowski" was actually the surname of her maternal grandparents.  Don't the Wilkomirskis and Grabowskis of this world realize that their exploitation of one of the most despicable events in history is not only self-indulgent and unbelievably selfish, but giving credibility to those misguided Holocaust-denying racist groups? Such lies will allow these scumbags to convince the lesser-informed folk out there that the attempted extermination of an entire race was also nothing but lies, which I'm sure never occured to these self-indulgent storytellers as they proceeded to betray countless REAL survivors, who have already suffered enough as it is 
 While I jumped into the character sporadically (I think this is the second one I read with him as the main character) it flowed fast and his smart remarks I always find humorous.  While the plot is quite weak and I actually guessed part of it, it was a fun read.  It went quick and should have built more into the red herring that the cover leads you to believe.  Even the school principal lacked some Ooommmph if you know what I mean.  The grandmother was a good role, but the parents coud have been much more important.  So overall, let's call it a quick read, funny and enjoyable, but not one of his best.  I picked it up at the airport and read it on the very same trip.  Not one I would keep, so back it went with the 50% return offer the airport here has 
 This is a terrible book, because it is written in absolutely no context whatsoever.  It is basically the worst, most hateful things that Muslims have written compiled into a book and presented to the West as Islam.  Judging from his introduction, it is clear that the editor (Parfrey) has a vendetta against Islam and he is trying to scare the West about Islam.  An analogy would be if somebody gathers up all the hateful Neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic literature in  America and presents it to the East as "America".  The author fails to mention that the views espoused in Extreme Islam are supported by a very small percentage of Muslims and there is a great movement in many Middle Eastern countries (especially Iran) against "fundamentalism".  Secondly, Parfery takes absolutely legitimate writings about the Palestinian resistance and tries to present them as "extreme", thus trying to lump in the hateful writings of Khomeini with the moderate Arabs who want peace in Palestine.   Disgusting 
 Great concept, but they slip off my ears way too often. Often enough that I stopped wearing them 
 this book is retared...i would never let no one else read this it really that bad...i cry it was so bad...every time i look at it makes me sneeze...now that bad...i just sneeze i look at it...it give laTisha ga 
 Clark's approach to home-schooling creates an endless treadmill of poorly  designed assignments which end up frustrating so many highly motivated  kids, not to mention their hard-working moms.  And the material is quite  unexceptional, when it's not downright mediocre. While advertised as  traditional Catholic, in reality, Clark's Seton-approach is rigid and  reactionary traditionalism 
 After the excellent 'Beauty Myth', I found this book to be a great disappointment. It may be useful for those women who have college degrees and now want to break the glass ceiling in the high powered business world,  but it has nothing to say to those of us who are still trying to get access  to equal pay and decent jobs. Wolf is a white middle class American and it  shows - she can talk to other women like herself, but in this book she has  absolutely nothing to say to the rest of us. Susan Faludi's book 'Backlash'  is far more worthwhile for addressing issues that matter to the majority of  women 
 I found this book too much focused on "Mission statements" "values" and "vision", which I would expect is your entrepreneural common sense. It includes very little about actually preparing statements or plans. There is only one sample plan at the end for a winery. I didn't find any information on approaching investors.  I returned this book and bought Nolo's book instead 
 I read Sleeping With Soldiers by Rosemary Daniell and found it disturbing. Like alcoholism or drug abuse, migratory sexuality is a true compulsive disorder and Daniell describes what a life of compulsive sexuality is  really like. Rosemary drank too much, tried drugs and engaged in a lot of  zipless sex as well as changing husbands. She had 3 husbands and 3 children  and a live in lover with whom she became pregnant and had an abortion. The  book is hard to describe. I seems to be a collection of previously  published articles and not a consistent voice. Sometimes it captures the  voice of people's speech patterns, other times it seems to brag about her  ability to have sex easily obtained and often that would make the reader  envious. Her ability to pick up men was the thrill of victory that became  the agony of defeat after a while. She claims to have been a cheer leader  in high school and the one with the most dates in the history of the  school. Really that popular 
 While the book itself is great, and shows how to build an "industrial (almost)strength" type machine, the required complexity and construction, are beyond the ability of many hobbyists (as well as being relatively expensive). In particular, it requires welding and fabrication skills not generally available to the home hobbyist. Having said that, there is much to be learned, and using some of instructions and resources in the book, many people could easily build (as I intend) to build a somewhat simpler version, than is shown in this book 
 Long periods of garbled static mixed with random brief moments of actual FM reception. This is in town trying to receive a major station. I am packaging this up and its going back today. This is my second try with Sony that has miserably failed. Guess maybe I should be looking at another mfg 
 This book was lacking something. There were alot of times in the book where it dragged and I was tempted to put it down. I was simply disappointed with this book. I don't think that E Lynn put enough thought into this one and so far it has been his worse 
    If you're considering buying this book, I want to look down at the bottom of this page and note the number of customer reviews.  Everything, I'm going to say has already probably been said by them, but I will continue on out of ego.  What drove so many people to their keyboards? Simply, rage.  I know that's the case with me anyways, dear readers.  I wasted an entire summer on these books hoping desperately that their former glory would somehow blaze back into life.  Sadly, I was mistaken.  Reading these novels now is just like drinking microwaved coffee.     I'm sure Jordan has never read Hemingway.  The former may look like the latter, but old rough and tough Ernest wouldn't waste time describing dresses when, I don't know, he could be instilling artistic value into the prose.  What about Jordans characterizations, though, you ask?  (You're probably not asking that,but just go along with it.)  Well, and this may be shocking, Jordan's world happens to be filled by personality dopplegangers.  It's as if every woman's genetic code was locked into the same sequence for all eternity.  Oh, sure they may look different (it's mostly because of the dresses, I think), but they all possess the exact same persona that is, basically, Jordan's botched attempt at a strong woman.  I cannot take another exclamation of "Men!"  I guess that's some sort of mantra that let's you know they're REAL strong women.  It must be far more effective than actually instilling them with depth of character and the ability to triumph in adverse circumstances.  Then there are his male characters, who are either jerks or, in Perrin's case, lesser jerks who you hate anyways.    But, the most greivous sin Jordan committs here is the utter stagnation of the plot.  Nothing happens.  Most of its an intricate dance of braid pulling and smoothing of skirts.  Rand is barely in it.  Which, doesn't really matter, it's not as if he's been doing anything great for the past couple books.  Tuon is terribly uninteresting, because, well, I've seen her many times before.  She's just part of Jordan's mad scheme to make sure every character's paired up and in everlasting love.  Which brings me to a point.  Why must Rand have three girlfriends?  If that is not the most teenage boy-oriented plot device ever employed.  And guess what, ones blonde, ones a rehead, and the other's a brunette.  Just thinking about it makes me want to cast down modern literature.                      Run from this novel 
 I didn't get 20 pages into this book before I said ENOUGH ALREADY GET TO THE PART WITH THE WHALES.  Sheesh.  Maybe the ending is good.  Maybe Ishmael and the whale become lifelong friends and live happily ever after.  I do not know because Mr. Melville wont stop rambling on and get to the POINT.  There is a nice picture of a whale on the cover of my copy anyway so that rates this book as TWO STARS.  The rest is mostly junk.  Back to the drawing board 
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 This book is not the quality of work that I've come to expect from Janette Oke.  I was very disappointed in it, and quit reading it about half way through.  The characters were lovable and interesting, but I thought the plot dragged just a bit too much for me 
 This was the absolute worst piece of dreck I have ever read.  The book definitely had promise and for the first 70 or so pages, I was hooked.  It seemed, however, that Morrell couldn't decide if he was writing a ghost/haunted house story, or an actual believable narrative.  He threw in things like a five legged cat and one eyed rats to make one believe that a bigger force was possibly at work. No such luck.  Instead his protanonist is a cross between Macgyver and Rambo.  There isn't a situation the guy can't get out of, and even though he's never been on an urban exploration before, he seemed to know more than the people who were hosting it.    HUGE holes in the overall story:  1. Much is made of a bottle of morphine that is from 1971 being too dangerous to take because it might be deadly, yet approximately ten pages later, the morphine is used without a thought (or a consequence).   2. A storm begins at roughly 11 at night and lasts until the early hours of the morning (even storms at the beach don't last that long).  The list goes on, but just in case you really want to frustrate yourself by actually reading this dreck, I'll keep the spoilers with issues to myself.  I wanted to throw this book at the wall numerous times and will never read another book by this author again.  The only thing worth noting is the author's note at the end.  That made a much better story than the one he decided to tell.  
 I have enjoyed Wambaugh's other true crime books, and watched for this one to go on the Best Seller lists.  When it didn't, I decided to buy it anyway.....And I wish I hadn't.  Wambaugh obviously despises the man he refers to as "the fire lover".  He holds him in such contempt that this is in no way an unbiased account, but on the contrary it is a diatribe against this man.  Admittedly, the "fire lover" has done some despicible things, but, please, let the reader come to that conclusion. Why write 338 pages about a man you hate?  Spare me......I'll read a more objective account of this in the newspapers 
 Ok, I don't mean to be rude, but if you think this is great writing you are woefully uneducated. It is almost a sad confirmation of the common stereotype of fundamentalist Christians being uneducated yokels that so many of them think this is great writing. Here's my take: I'd enjoy a good "end of times" story - this just isn't it. The Left Behind series is amateurish and poorly written and just plain astonishing to me that it has had such huge success. P.T. Barnum once said that no one ever went broke understimating the intelligence of the American public and this series proves it. Christians should demand better writing from their revered authors. Go read some C.S. Lewis or something - please. 
 This book is not for firefighter's or fire officer's. This title is very misleading. A more appropriate title would be, Human Resource Managers Manual. This book was put on my departments Lt. and Capt. promotional test strictly by its deceiving title. I asked our Chief to read it and he agreed that it is horrible. I will never read another book or article by Steven T. Edwards 
 This is the kind of work that causes mental illness. A young, impressionable reader will turn to this author with the expectation of discovering what reality is, only to be misled into a corrupt concept of the author's personal, mystical "reality." A nightmare.  Authors like this should be held legally liable for the damages they inflict.   If you prefer your reality clear, honest and concrete, consult such works as Vitzthum's "Materialism."  
 This book has some useful information but it doesn't fit the bill as an emergency book because much of it includes things like recipes which you cook in an 350 degree oven - which you may not have in a true emergency.  Also, there are a lot of charts that look good but really don't help that much.  9 pages on the use of honey seems a bit much too.  Resource section lists lots of resources but closer examination shows that many aren't geared to individuals or only carry one item for emergency use 
 Terri Schiavo wasn't allowed to die--she was slowly and painfully murdered.  If she was in a PVS, why was she given morphine as she lay dehydrating and starving?  People who are in a vegetative state are not supposed to feel pain--right!?  Murderers are put to death in a more humane way than Terri was.  They pass within minutes of their humane lethal injections.  Terri suffered for two weeks until she died.  And, since when is giving food and water artificial life support!!!  I care for an 8-year old mentally challenged girl and I feed her strictly through a feeding tube.  Terri was not on a respirator.    If you want the real truth about this case, first read SILENT WITNESS by Mark Fuhrman.  It is an unbiased account of the Terri Schiavo case.  Next, I recomment A LIFE THAT MATTERS by Terri's family.  There has been so many lies and misconceptions about Terri's condition.  One person and one person only decided Terri's fate--Juge Greer.  One person should not have all that power.  There was overwhelming evidence that Terri was not a "vegetable"  and he didn't care.  Please read the books I have suggested.  If it is illegal to commit suiside, why is it legal to starve and dehydrate a defenseless human being?  It's one thing to turn off a respirator, but to kill someone in the manner they did Terri is horrific.  Didn't someone named Hitler do that across Europe several years ago?   Christin 
 I had this professor for a history of economics class and she writes just as she teaches; listlessly.  She meanders all over the place and will often throw in what she perceives as relevant information, but isn't about her trip to the Great Wall of China in the middle of discussing the pyshiocrats.  This book is bombastic in language, excessive in wordiness, and it will make you fall asleep by mid paragraph. Seriously, skip this book.  It is by far the worst economics book I've ever read 
 This CD was not at all what I expected.  It sounds just like you are in Church.  Every song is accompanied by an organ and most of them sung in soprano.  The tempo of all the songs is very slow too!  I was looking for something I could sing along to, not put me to sleep!  On the positive side, there are some beautiful songs, I just wish they were sung more "up beat" 
 I am no hardcore vegetarian but do enjoy meatless meals.  I love cooking and experimenting different foods.  I particularly enjoy dishes that include beans, tofu and grains (as in, I'm not a huge fan of having to eat a big platter of steamed broccoli and carrots for dinner...)  Well,I have to say that I was rather disappointed in this "essential" vegetarian cookbook, for it almost contains none of those recipes I was hoping for!  Mostly she introduces "weird" meals that require mail-ordered foods.  Well, not too handy if you ask me!  I have however tried a few recipes, mainly muffins (very nutritious and healthy) but all the recipes seem faulty...!  I am an experimented cook and all I've tried to bake in this book so far did not turned out.  I leave muffins and breads in the oven for hours and they do not cook in the centre etc.  Have those recipes ever been tested???  This being said, I have to say that few cookbooks offer such appealing descriptions (too bad the actual recipes don't match the mouth watering introductions) and such complete nutritional information.  If you think you were a bunny in a past life and don't care what your food tastes like, then this might be great for you.  As for me, this book is on its way to a charity 
 This book goes on my list of the worst books I have ever read.  It took me 3 tries and a five days to get through the introduction. I had to read it for my Ap US History class, and sure, it was very educational. (I have a test on it tomorrow, so let's see how much I retained) It just took FOREVER!  I spend 7 days locked in my room while on vacation in the beautiful Smokey Mountains. Those 5 days it took me to read the intro are not included. I read all day every day and it bored me to death.  I constantly drifted off and fell asleep reading it four out of those 7 days.  I liked the last chapter... because it was the last. 
 Another torrent of mild tripe from everyone's "favourite" DJ, Tiesto.   What on earth is he going to do when the supply of inane, pastel-coloured eurovomit dance music runs out? When I think about the number of times I've heard him touted as "World's Number One Best Voted DJ" or "DJ Mag Top 100 Finalist", you'd start to think that the man can actually mix records, when in fact rather than mix them, he tends to grind them together roughly into a nightmarish aural paste then reconfigure them violently in new, unusual and horrendously nauseating forms.  I can absolutely confirm this. I have had the startling and displeasing experience of witnessing it live.   The sad truth of the matter is, that there are any number of drug-addicted fluoro-pants-wearing 16 year old ravers out there, and all are quite willing to buy boring rubbish like this.  Or at least all are prepared to ask their mum and dad to buy it for them for xmas. I sign off in disgust 
 I have read many of Koontz's books and I have got to say that this is the worst one that I've read to date.  For those that have yet to sink their teeth into some of Koontz's better work, I would suggest Mr. Murder or Intensity.  Leave this one on the shelf to collect dust.  Or better yet, throw it in the trash with the rest of the garbage.  
 If you have any interest in learning about Radiohead's amazing album "OK Computer", then I implore you NOT to buy this book. The author, Dai Griffiths, wastes a full 34 pages before even beginning to discuss "OK Computer". In the first 34 pages the author covers topics like "The CD Album", "Against The CD Album: the continued presence of the vinyl model", and "Genuinely Extended Song Forms". Once the reader has labored through all the un-needed minutae the author thought was pertinent for the reader to understand the story of how "OK Computer" came to be, it's all academic. None of the chapters cover the artistic area of the album's creation or the artist's emotions. Dai Griffiths would be a wonderful writer to hire for the writing of a math or science text book, but for god's sake keep this writer away from the art 
 The final book of the trilogy was barely good. The character development that occured in the second  book kind of stalled and one of the characters became very cardboard and uninteresting.  Another character that could have been very interesting was not developed to full potential and kind of left a disappointing hole in the story for me.   The plot twists that I have been reading the novels to resolve came to a conclusion to quickly and without much fanfare. What he did write was average. I just thought it could have been so much better.   It just seemed so generic. The first two books were better and seemed less rushed to me. This one felt like it was written on a deadline, especially toward the end. The trilogy as a whole suffers as a result.  If this last book had been as good as the first two I would have given the trilogy a confident recommendation but now I can only recommend it if you are really into heroic fantasy and can make more of the characters in your mind than the author makes of them in the final book 
 I can't believe how many great reviews this horrible film got. The acting is laughable as is the writing. There are also many mistakes and inaccuracies! They depict the heroes as perfection and the enemy as monkeys.  Real life isn't like that.  I guess just because this movie is pro-war people automatically back it up.  But this is the worst movie I have ever seen.  
 The plot in Final Analysis is trite and overused and the characters are flat and stock. Tedious and painful to read 
 I found this book very disappointing. For one thing, the author suggests a creepy method of spanking children, including a chart on the wall of the "discipline" to be administered with a wooden spoon for various offenses. But hey, that's not punishment, maintains the author. If I can't keep my children's interest in the material without hitting them with a spoon, then there is a major problem with the instruction.  I'm not going to resell or give this book away. I'm going to throw it out so it doesn't fall into the hands of someone who actually follows her advice 
 After reading this book I can only say that the author is selling something unreal , the figues he uses in the book are totally unrealistic . talking about 10 and 12 to 15 percent returns on investment , like they are the readers just for the taking .his advice reminds me of the old Steve Martin shtick on how to become a millionaire , Steve says " O.k. first you get a million dollars then..."  This is basically what the author is saying, This book has no real pracital advice , It is just another author getting rich telling everyone else how to.Very disappointing , I would not waste my money if i were you .  
 Cagle's book has a wide variety of cartoons in various styles, but the book is badly hampered by Cagle's insistence that political cartoonists are primarily left-leaning (10 to 1 was the claim, which he ironically justifies by suggesting that liberals think that people are mostly "stupid" and so since that's where humor lies, there are naturally more liberals in cartooning.  He also refers to conservatives as humorless - as a stereotype, to be fair - but one that makes you wonder if the man has ever read P.J. O' Rourke, Jonah Goldberg, Rob Long, Mark Steyn, or listened to Rush Limbaugh, just to name a few.)  Cagle then goes on to pander to that assumption my placing an overwhelming number of liberal cartoonists in the pages, mildly broken up by the odd conservative cartoon.  The intros to the chapters are full of misinformation (One example is the matter of fact state ment that there's a civil war going on in Iraq...not yet, though sadly I'm sure that's wishful thinking on some leftists' part - but a country whose factions are all working towards a single government is not in civil war - there's a difference between that and a country wracked by terror.  Another: In the intro to cartoons on Hurricane Katrina, there wasn't a single mention of Governor Blanco or Mayor Nagin, an appaling omission.)  Even the chapter selections, including a section on Pat Robertson, but leaving out Howard Dean and the DNC which got a fair amount of attention from political cartoonists (and writers) this past year demonstrates a kind of calculated bias on Cagle's part.  The main problem though is that the intellectual quality of political cartooning has diminshed considerably in the past two decades.  This was already apparent when Berke Breathhead won a well-deserved award for Bloom County some years back, an award richly deserved over the polemical and often plainly didactic work of the majority of political cartoonists then and unfortunately now.  Cagle's collection is full of works that rely on the most biased, unfair, and extreme take on events, a take which will leave many readers on both left and right scratching or even shaking their heads.    However, to be fair to Cagle, this sort of simplistic bias is well rewarded by the media and the same establishment that liberals always seem to rail against, forgetting that they form a large part of it.  Anderson's Pulitzer portfolio was embarrassingly didactic and ham-fisted, and example of an award that seems to have been given out because it was one cartoonist's time.  The art of the cartoons vary and it is still nice to see some artists using brushwork and detail, even in the face of the increasingly small spaces newspapers give their artists to work with.  Ultimately though, Cagle's book is a sad reminder of the fact that the polemics of the overrated Post cartoonist Herblock  have trumped the more balanced and thoughful approach of a cartoonist like Mauldin.  That probably shouldn't be such a surprise in an age where partisan rancor is extremely high and unbearably dishonest.  To see it celebrated though is a kick in the gut to those of us who have followed and admired political cartooning for decades.  One hopes this the a deep valley from which this valuable craft shall emerge.  Right now though, that's seems a day too far off 
 I zipped through the first 100 pages of this book unable to put it down.  Unfortuneately the author seems to run out of gas after that.  The main character just goes on a big, boring sight seeing tour.  It reminded me of that show on the Travel Channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design. There is not a hint of conflict until the final pages and then it's very short-lived and quickly followed by one of the worst non endings I've ever read.  The book just stops.  Not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel.  It's a shame because Grimsley had some great concepts to work with.  In my experience novels that mix technology with magic usually fail at both, but Grimsley had a workable foundation he could have developed into something unique if he had focused on the SF concepts instead of minutiae.    Once in a while the characters stop admiring the drapes long enough to notice the GIANT FREAKIN' PORTAL BETWEEN TWO WORLDS--but enough about that.   Gee, what a lovely sofa.. 
 Wow, how disappointing.  I am a grower/lover of bearded irises and automatically purchase any newly published book on the subject.  This book is just set up poorly to read, the varieties depicted are from the author's garden(I assume) are bland, boring, and non representative of some of the finest varieties of bearded irises out there.  I really didn't appreciate most of the photography either...a lot of that artsy "looking into the center of the flower" stuff.  The only reason it got even two stars is that I appreciate the author's text in some areas and that she's endeavored to create a book to showcase and promote the iris.  Unfortunately, the overall effort seems to fall short 
 Not particularly interesting or funny. None of the ridiculous turns of language of a Dave Barry column, no elder-statesman crabbiness like Andy Rooney's. Just routine bitching about airlines, office supplies, and so on. Save it for "A Walk in the Woods" or "A Short History of Nearly Everything 
 My impression was that this tape contained the most basic ideas that author's in this subject matter have ever presented. For eg., "People crossing hands in front of their chest means that they aren't accepting what you are telling them." That is the most typical statement I have ever heard, and this tape is full of them. There is nothing enlightening, nothing that makes you glad that you bought and listened to the tape. I felt it was not good use of time or money.  Fo 
 The author is indifferent regarding the development of masculine characteristics. The positive reviews seem to be from readers who sought the book because it reinforces their own predisposition to raising children androgenously. That does not make this a good book 
 I am Network+, i-Net+, and A+ certified and had previously used Coriolis books on the exam.  It lacks any sort of proofreading, and even some of the questions in the book and the CD are wrong after I had to lookup answers to make sure.  There are erroneous spelling and technical mistakes.  I thought I would give Mr. Kay a try....don't be an idiot like me, DO NOT GET THIS BOOK.  Stick with Coriolis or Sybex 
 A friend recommended this book to me when I became pregnant.  I really cannot recommend anybody to buy this book if you want to get a realistic idea of what pregnancy is going to be.  If you follow her advice to not work out anymore and eat for two, yes, you will indeed outgrow your husbands cloths.  That was actually the end of reading for me 
 If you're a big fan of the Frank Peretti novels such as "Piercing the Darkness", you might enjoy this story of evil, demons and semi-Biblical themes. As a Christian, I found the parallels to the Bible to be interesting, but not compelling. In fact, these parallels were the only thing that kept me reading. In creating this work of fiction, Meyers goes well beyond the biblical descriptions of events-and this is fine. The problem I found was that Meyer's writing style is a bit annoying. It seemed like everything was measured in yards-the truck was getting closer and closer, 20 yards, 17 yards, 13 yards, and so on. It just didn't ring true with me. Meyers is fond of telling us that tears "burn" the eyes of his characters. And there are elements of the plot that seem contrived to add to the story. Sarah, a research scientist at a parapsychology lab drives an old car with a bad carburator. A single woman with a high-paying job would fix it or replace the car; she wouldn't put her safety in jeopardy. But Sarah is "too into her work". Even after the bad guy attacks her and her car fails to start when she tries to run away, she still drives the thing. In fact, the very next day she's giving her boss a long ride out in the country in it-even though her boss has a fancy car back in the parking lot. Another nail in the coffin is that even though Sarah's attacker's identity is known nobody calls the police. This leaves him free to commit more crimes that add to the story. And it goes on.   I'm afraid that Christians desperate for this kind of literature will artificially inflate the popularity of this book. It's really not a high-quality work 
 what we are left with is another middle-aged male who had to leave his wife (who stayed through all the s**t)and children in order to "find himself".  Not suprisingly in  the arms of a YOUNG blonde "angel".  Kudos to him for getting sober--a rasberry to him for what he has done with his soberity and to the immediate family who loved him through to it 
 Despite translating thousands of worthless Latin quotations, the editor of this edition leaves large passages from the section on Love Melancholy, which Burton waggishly wrote in Latin, untranslated. Burton demands enough of one's patience; one shouldn't have to put up with this sort of nonsense from his editor, even if one's Latin is good. After plodding through over a thousand pages, the reader has earned a little titillating trivia. Also, if you've forgotten your Latin, Burton's notes are left untranslated. Finally, I'll say that although Burton is amusing, the book is too long with too little content. Go back to his sources, read Swift, read Marcus Aurelius, read Kierkegaard on religious despair; and then, if you have time, read Burton-- or skim him 
 Another reviewer has stated that Mark often.It's good songs.Small package.Bring home some milk ok?It gets out stains too 
 I have had my Magic Bullet for a year, using it almost exclusively for mixed drinks. Others are right - forget about using it for onions or garlic or peppers, it chops them too finely, into mush. The pulse action quit working, and I had to toss it. The cup actually became lodged in the motor unit and I had a hard time getting it out. Have finally bought a Tribest, I'll see how that one is. 
 Years ago, when I was a married man living in Marion, Indiana, I recall my ex-wife muttering once about something having to do with a lynching that had taken place in Marion years ago. I never got any details, but it clearly disturbed her to talk about it.  A couple of weeks ago, while browsing the Internet, I ran across the picture of Abe Smith and Thomas Shipp, their bruised lifeless bodies hanging limp while a crowd of White men and women stand beneath smiling and appearing oh so proud and pleased at what they had accomplished.  And, then, it hit me. My ex-wife's mother's maiden name was Shipp.  We people of color, even now, in this generation, carry such heavy scars from the barbarism of so many brutal Whites. How should I explain to my son what probably happened to one of his ancestors?  I needed to know what happened, so I read Madison's book. Throughout this entire book, Madison writes as if the third young black man, James Cameron, who barely escaped a similar fate as Smith and Shipp, may have participated in the murder and may have raped Mary Ball. In all his research, Mr. Madison, a White Indiana University professor, doesn't seem to have been able to determine if Cameron was guilty or innocent, or even if Mary Ball had really been raped.  Next, I read "A Time of Terror", the eyewitness account of the third brother, James Cameron, who barely escaped from a similiar fate as Smith and Shipp. From Cameron, I found out that his innocence was beyond question. He was sent to jail by an all white (of course) Indiana jury, no surprise there. But, during the trial, Mary Ball admitted that she had never seen Cameron before and, furthermore, that she had not been raped.  The pertinent question, here, is why Madison, a White Indiana University professor, chose not to believe the accounts of the only two surviving eyewitnesses, Cameron and Ball?   Cameron and Ball are both dead now. And, Cameron's book is now out of print. I had to spend $75  to get a used paperback edition.  I have to wonder, if he had been alive in Marion, Indiana in the year 1930, would Madison, a White Indiana University professor, have been one of those godless people we see standing and smiling and looking so pleased as they admire the Strange Fruit hanging from the trees?  
 I looked forward with great anticipation to this book. Koolhaas' "Delirious New York" was a fascinating work, and "S,M,L,XL" was both interesting and a great argument against hard drives. This book was a major disappointment. It doesn't delve very deeply at all into it's subject matter (the Pearl River Delta area of China) and most of it's "important ideas" are sophomoric. I would say the most irritating thing about this book (other than the totally artless and pointless photographs that litter the book) are the code phrases (highlighted in red) that read like a grad student's compendium of inanities. Don't waste your money 
 Dr. Laura occasionally gives excellent advice, and I admire her willingness to stand up for what's decent and moral.  However, her supposition that husbands do not need a book or advice is almost blasphemous.  God created men and women and the institution of marriage, and even He gives instructions to husbands as to how they should treat their wives!  God "wrote a book" called the Bible which contains advice for husbands as well as wives because God knows the success of a marriage depends on BOTH parties doing their part.    This book is great for women who are unkind to their husbands.  When unkind people change and become kind and considerate to all those with whom they have a relationship, it CAN have an impact on the behavior of others.  But this applies not only to women and wives but to men and husbands as well.  Many women are suffering because, after reading all the books they can and doing everything within their power, their husbands do not respond.  So the self-doubting and blame continues, and it's needless.  The attitude that a successfull and happy marriage rests solely with the wife is detrimental to EVERY marriage 
 Unfortunatley, Ms. Ornstein's book is not based on actual research, but rather on pre-established suppositions. The gender climate of a school is best evaluated by looking at two factors - student grades and disciplinary actions.  If male students have lower grades than female students, and/or if more male students are disciplined than female students, then it is clear that the school is anti-boy and is simply not trying to teach male students.  Fortunatley, parents are waking up to this fact, and there have been several lawsuits (most notably in Wisconsin) challenging public schools gender bias against male students.  The so called "gender-fair" class menitoned in this book wasn't - since not as many male as female students received "A's".    This book also does not evaluate issues outside of school.  For example, the best measure of the status of a demographic group is to look at mortality rate.  The fact that male students in all demographic groups have a higher mortality rate than female students is not discussed.  This is particularly important since a major contributing factor to this trend is the fact that adolescent males have a higher suicide rate than adolescent females.  Orenstein also does not discuss this gender gap in arrest rate.  Again, the "health" of a demographic group in school is easy to evaluate - simply look at grades and discipline.  
 This is truly one of the worst books I have ever read.  The writing style is tedious and jumbled.  Jacoby has little sense of logical flow.  But more importantly, her historical research is TERRIBLE.  The examples are endless, but for example: *Jacoby argues that the Founding Fathers really wanted a strict church and state separation, but then goes on to only quote Jefferson and Madison.  So what happened to the many other framers, such as Washington, Hamilton, Adams, Jay, and so forth?  Oh right, they probably didn't fit her argument just so, so she conveniently leaves them out. *According to Jacoby, Lincoln never mentioned the Almighty/God/Supreme Being in the Gettysburg Address.  Clearly, she has never read this speech. *Jacoby also blames organized religion for helping slavery keep its grip on the country.  Essentially, Jacoby sees it as an organized religion v. freethinking issue.  Wrong!  It was a sectional issue, and people from both groups supported both sides.  These are a few examples, and her bad work on these aspects is enough to make one doubt everything else she says.  Additionally, her critiques of 'non-freethinkers' is especially biting, and serves to make her sound childish rather than educated.    Save your money and buy something else 
 When I first began reading I found the stories to be unrealistic but thought that it may still be worth reading.  For Example: The man who hits his child because the child said they had gone to a specific place only last night when they actually had gone days/weeks ago. His claim was that the child was a liar. Anyone who is interested in bringing up a well child would not behave that way and certainly a person like that is not interested in reading a book to improve their parenting skills. Anywho, I thought this book would give me creative ideas with discipline when the book is really about, as Tucson Toddler Mom said, common sense ideology.  I was most disappointed in their advocating "crying it out" (Yes, H. King they did advocate - check the "Sleeping Single" on pg. 130) and their bias against co-sleeping. They cite Alfred Adler as their co-sleeping "expert" who wrote junk psychoanalytical theories in early 1900s. In the section "sleeping with Parents" on pg 136 the writers write: "Some people believe children feel more loved and secure when they sleep in their parents' bed. Other experts believe children become demanding and dependent when they sleep with their parents......."  Note the "other experts" as opposed to "some people" They are using the ole' "people in white lab coats" ploy to tilt you to their opinion on the subject. Shame on them! This is when I quit reading. They don't want you to hit your kids but it's ok to leave them crying and alone in another room for no good reason.  Of course, you probably now know that my husband and I are a co-sleeping, non hitting parents and IMO, babies were not intended to sleep alone. Otherwise the dingos would drag them away and eat them! More seriously though, I believe as some EXPERTS do: Co-sleeping has far more benefits than negatives and I don't believe that "crying it out" is ever an option. If you differ then this is the book for you ;) 
 I am very disappointed in TMNT: Fast Forward. The episodes are just boring. It's really a shame cause the 2003 series was such a brilliant series with great characters and story continuity. 4Kids really ruined TMNT with this horrible fast forward nonesense. I am all for trying new things, and I don't hate Fast forward for being too campy, after all I am a hardcore fan of the original 1987 series, but this is just painful to watch. I am not going to buy this DVD, I have seen all the episodes and none of them have any redeeming quality. I am saving my money for The Ninja Tribunal Season, which takes place after the forth season. I really hope 4Kids won't ruin the 2003 series for us fans by not releasing The Ninja Tribunal season, in favour of Fast forward. That would really be a shame! 
 Or at least not what I was looking for...but based on all the other reviews here, I thought it was.  This book has a very limited audience in mind, namely those who are giving "speeches", not just regular, everyday presentations and meetings.  The name of the book is deceiving, and so are the reviews.  The first chapter is the only one that is moderately worthwhile if you're actually looking for tips on becoming more confident.  Otherwise, it is simply a laundry list of ways to give big speeches; not helpful at all to the average joe who works in corporate america and just wants to feel more confident.  I realize this is difficult to teach in a book, but the other reviewers gave the impression that I might garner some tidbits on this.  
 the book i ordered was suposed to be the fourth edition. i received the second edition.  be careful when you order your books online, some people might be sneaky and leave information out. however, it did arrive quickly, and in great condition. it just wasn't what i ordered 
 If this book wasn't so full of valuable information, I wouldn't have given it a single star.  The proof reader slept through this edition.  There are more errors than I could have ever imagined.  They sometimes refer to the same variable by different names in succeeding paragraphs!  Many times they leave off critical subscript identifiers or don't label important values in the example figures.  Small errors crop up all the way through this edition.  Hope they fix the Seventh 
 "A skepticism towards all meta-narratives" according to... Jacques Derrida, I think...  This is about all the elaboration that is done on the subject of what post-modernism IS.  With regards to what a meta-narrative is, it apparently refers to a fully general philosophical theory, concerning (e.g.) all knowledge-claims; all justificatory strategies; all moral values, rights, and obligations; all instances of injustice;      Apparently this 'theory' differs from nihilism, but if that is what defines it, I don't see how.             If you actually want to learn about post-modernism, this is not a book I could recommend; internet resources have been much more useful.  The section on modern art history and the crisis of expression was interesting, as well as some other random factoids that apparently relate to post-modernism.  On the whole though, I'd say this is a work totally devoid of substance, and and as I learn more I'm inclined to assign the same description to post-modernism itself.  For a similar, comical, and much more scathing review, see the one below entitled "Trash" by 'a reader' 
 If you are like me, you struggle every time Microsoft changes ADO. We have to rely on "experts" and their books to help us through the ADO direction of year. Unfortunately, I would not use "ADO.Net 2 - Programming with SQL Server 2005, Oracle and MySQL" as one of them. After a slow start with database fundamentals not related to .Net, the book seems to start in the right direction and then quickly derails. The authors make a serious point about how ADO.Net 2 is suppose to help us develop against any database system, but then spends the rest of the pages bypassing this ability without informing the reader. So not surprising, the examples are confusing; not database agnostic, disconnected, abstracted and difficult to follow. Nearly all the example code only works for SQL Server 2005. The book attempts to recover with specific chapters for Oracle and MySQL, but is thin and short on examples.  I found something interesting from each chapter, but I personally would rather have just one reference book on each subject. With this book, you might end up needed additional references 
 I bought this book after having read a couple of Katzenbach's books that I really enjoyed. However, I found myself struggling to get through this book and skipping over large sections that just couldn't hold my interest. Bottom line, I wanted to like this book, but just couldn't 
 I was so angry that I wasted time reading this spectacularly boring book that I had to warn others.  The storyline is repetitious as is the diction...I have to agree with the author of review that asked if DS even has an editor anymore.  Sheesh... 
 If I could have given this book no stars I would have.  It was a complete waste of money and time.  Ms. Bacall comes across as a sour, shrewish old woman.  I don't know why actors think their political opinions are the ones we should all have.  Her disdain for her fellow Americans and our President lost her this former fan.  I've read my last book by Bacall 
 Title says it all.  I enjoyed the 1st-3rd book in series.  Forth book sort of dragged.  By the middle of this book I had to make a decision...keep going with an endless supply of boring pages and books ahead or throw in the towel.  Let's face it, life's too short.  If you want a thousand pages of satisfaction pick up the unabridged version of "The Stand".  I'm afraid this doesn't do it.    Think about it another way do you want to read over 5000 pages of a series that has mixed reviews from like minded fantasy readers?  Cheer 
 This is a 12-page promotional piece for Kouzes' and Posner's books and Leadership Practices Inventory, a 30-item questionnaire about leadership, written in the breathy style of business-school literature.  A true non-value.  If you are interested in their work, buy The leadership Challenge (Jossey-Bass, 1997), which has the same editorial tone but at least says something 
 I'm sure their intentions were good, but this is filled with the most inaccesable and arcane language structures, it's almost impossible to read and understand. Whereas it is not an interpretation of the Tao Te Ching, but rather an application of Taoism, Alex Anatole's THE TRUTH OF TAO, is much more accessable 
 It is a miracle that Misha was not hit by a car. Letting a dog roam free in an urban area for days is something your most common and average citizen would never do. But then they aren't involved in important experiments like Liz is.  Anyone with common sense could see that Misha, the Siberian Husky that Liz used for a completely useless experiment, could very easily have been hit by a car and either killed, or seriously injured and then try to find his way home in pain and fear.  No problem for Liz though. She's got research to do! What amazing irony that one of the dangers for Misha that Liz acknowledged was the "dognappers" who could have taken Misha for use in laboratory experiments 
 Recently I was woken up to the sound of Tower of Power, playing "Happy about that", and I was very impressed.  I had never heard of this group, and a little surfing revealed all.  I promptly ordered "Oakland Zone" and listened to it with great anticipation.  It was at this point that I realised why the radio station chose to play "Happy about that" - it is the only track on the CD worth listening to (settle down you soul experts, I am obviously a newbie here).  Seriously though - the one track is very polished and pleasing to the ear, while the remainder of the tracks are nothing but a bunch of what I would class as "B" sides.  I expect T.O.P. have produced far better in the past - I must give them another chance I guess 
 I ordered this book through a book club. I thought is sounded like a good book that my girls could relate to - it was terrible!The tooth fairy looks scary, and the descriptions of teeth being pulled are awful for kids!  Children are concerned about losing their teeth, if it will hurt, etc.  These pictures and text only added to their fears!! I read "Love You Forever" by this author, and so I thought this would be a gentle, sensitive tale of teeth coming out - UGH!  Once I finished reading the book, my 5 year old said:  "Mom that is just scary. I don't like it!" 
 B Grade movie, really poor script. Bulk of movie is boring, superficial, stereotypical. Real purpose of movie is Baptist condemnation of the supernatural.  Story line. The wife of a couple deeply in love dies in a boating accident during a beachhouse visit. The husband feels a deep loss for two years during which he is frequently visited by the ghost of the wife. On the second anniversary of the accident relatives and friends gather at the beachhouse and push the husband to come to grips with his grief and refocus his energy to move on with his life.  Overtones. The leading man is depicted as unstable, self-centered, reckless, irresponsible, and fantasy-prone.before and during the two year period. When revealed to the those assembled, the spirit contact with his wife is universally condemned. His "giving up the ghost" is seen as a great relief and the first sign of maturity he has displayed in his life.  The daughter has dream sequence with the mother in which the mother coaxes her into a head-on crash with a car.leaving her frightened and distraught.  Media Messages. The film illustrates the creation and reinforcement of a cultural taboo. 1. Spirit contact is dangerous, selfish, and emotionally unhealthy. 2. The personal grieving journey of another should be co-opted by peers. 3. Condemnation is the only acceptable response to spirit contact. There should be no expression of curiosity or investigation like "What did she look like?" "What kinds of things did she say?" 4. Messages from loved ones in dreams should not be trusted. In short the movie creates a set of automatic responses all of which mitigate against a common sense acceptance and appreciation of the value of spirit contact with loved ones.. In life our conduct is about building bonds of love and trust with those around us. In passing over these ties endure and can be building blocks for a link to the beyond. When William Blake's brother passed, he appeared and taught the skill engraving thus providing humanity for centuries thereafter with icons known to all. Many near-death experiencers have wisely learned that they must keep their wisdom to themselves. The inner teachings are sacred and must not be diluted and defiled by small minds. The same is true for after-death communications largely because of media images that create a cultural storyline like that in this film 
 I totally agree with the authors' arguments. We do indeed have a class system in the United States, and it really does matter. But my god this is a horrible book. The authors go on and on and on and on and on and on about the same things. This is another one of those books that should have been shortened into a 10 page magazine article. It was so bad that I had to stop reading it half way through.  A much better book is Paul Fussell's somewhat dated "Class: A Guide Through the American Status System" 
 Just an OK read.  A major disappointment given the reviews and previous Sue Miller novels.  I wouldn't bother 
 The spring on these tongs broke on first use, in September, 2006.  This renders them largely useless. I purchased the tongs after reading manufacturer assurances dated many months ago that the spring problem had been repaired.  Despite this assurance, I am here to tell you that a pair shipped recently is still defective.  I returned them, and I cannot recommend these tongs 
 The plot is confussing and weakly held together by the detailed personal stories. I found little that was morally redeeming or outstanding in this book. Having grown-up in Oklahoma, I found the book unauthentic. I cannot recommend this book 
 Just start reading the introduction, or flip to anywhere in this book to see all you need to know about it's readability:  a bit rough to say the least.  For example, in the introduction, the concept of carrying binary data in a shorter period of time on a wire than several measured pulses was presented in such a confusing manner that I was forced to read it 4 times to understand what was already a simple and understood concept to me.  The excessive formality of this book is a killer.. It reads at times like a formal mathematics proof book, however,  at other times it is a bit more readable.    Like people said.. use this for reference.. not for a textbook 
  The good thing about this movie is that it didn't last more than it did. Not that it's bad, no, it's a fine depressing movie. It may be very well acted -Duvall is great all right-, with nice songs perhaps, well directed if you like... But unless you feel identified with these characters -and I don't- there's no way you can enjoy watching this.   This is what I saw: All the characters here are self-centered individuals, conceited, self-pitying, deplorable and depressing. Duvall plays a drunk who quits drinking to start (perhaps) a new life. That he in the past was a sucessful country singer makes no difference to me, it just adds to his self-pity. I couldn't find anything positive in this story. Even the kids that show are aggravating with their persistent questions.   The picture we have here is that of a bunch of losers and dreamers. Everybody seems to blame someone else for his miseries. The children their parents, the wives their ex-husbands (& viceversa). Death, either thru war or car accidents, plays a major role too. It seems people have trouble getting over it, looking for someone to blame it on. Then the scenes in the church... I'm not sure what they are intended for. The three main characters (Duvall, Harper and the kid) go to church; him and the kid even get baptized, but they have no idea what church is all about; to them it's a social ritual (a tradition, a superstition?). This is not a movie about faith. It's about the troubles of these guys; the lady needs a man because she's young and lonely; the man needs... he needs to grow up; the kid needs a father and some homework. Nobody cares for others, only for themselves.  Honestly, the irony about this movie is that it's so realistic and its characters so phony. I understand why Duvall went immediately to make 'The Apostle', where he plays a role opposite to this one 
 This is the first Grafton book I've read, but I'm pretty sure it will be my last.  Simply put, this is the worst book I've read in the past year.  The plot is ridiculous: it centers around the murder of woman who is prostitute/porn star/water treatment plant worker.  The characters only exist as canned responses to the investigator's questions.  Critical clue are revealed in predictable fashion to achieve an utterly anti-climactic ending devoid of any epiphanies or suspense.  
 The Body Project provides very selective leeway into the societal effects of African-American adolescent girls and their personal body projects. The main focus of this book is on the evolution of the white middle-class adolescent girl throughout American history. African-American and Jewish girls are mentioned briefly in a few chapters, while other ethnic groups are simply never discussed. Are these other various ethnic groups not worthy of their equal place in Brumberg's book? Brumberg focuses on the evolution of the white middle-class female adolescent starting in the early 1800s and ending in the late 1990s. An evolution of the African American adolescent also took place during these times, but differently than that of their white female counterparts.  In order to understand black American adolescents today, foundation for cultural practices must first be established. Brumberg never mentions the coexistence of enslaved blacks, in America during the 18th or 19th centuries. Though all women have the same biological anatomy, our genes vary, our cultures vary, so we should dispel the idea that when certain groups of women who menstruate earlier than others are abnormal or inferior. Brumberg reveals that this type of thought was well circulated throughout the medical community remained true during the Victorian period. The notion that black health was considered an expendable asset in the American medical community well through the early 1970s.  One major issue that Brumberg avoids is the abuse of children and adolescents. There is probably a close connection between the body projects that adolescents undertake and their harsh self-image.  Brumberg fails to expand on the greater idea that people exist who can never truly choose their identity before it first chooses them. Many girls are intrinsically bound to a stereotype, despite self-image. Possibly everyone has small things that they would like to alter about their physical appearances; however Americans also fail to see these "body projects" as a form a western female mutilation, of which millions of women have fallen victim. Plastic surgery is an ever-growing project that young girls obsess about. This standard idea of beauty that girls manipulate themselves on must disappear, before our individuality as women disappears.  
 Boring, outdated ex-patriate story of life in Paris between the wars, focusing on a young American actress, a psychologist Dr. Diver and his wife, an American baroness with issues.  Lots of drinking and gossip 
 This is the worst series of books I have ever used in any certification program.  You get to read quotes from Jerry Seinfeld, but I doubt that he could set up a Novell Network, what is the point???  The same info over and  over and in no particular order, the author jumps back and forth and never  fully explains any one topic. . .  Save your time and money, either get  some real world experience or find a class because this is not going to  help you certif 
 It is true, the pages fall out faster than you can use them. And the puzzles are not jumble like in a real game. For example, in a real game no one stops to tell you, "ok look for an X-ray Attack"... and so the book is not helpful. Instead, I recommend- "Sharpen Your Tactics 
 This book has come good information, but too many things are constantly repeated.  There is no flow to the book and when you get interested in the idea of the book, Constance goes off on a tangent that takes you off the beaten path.  I read a number of historical business books out there and have to say that although there is a lot of history about the company, the author did very little to keep your interest.  I would not recommend getting this book 
 This book is so full of waffle and technical innacuracies, dangerous ones at that, see the chapter on wiring a battery. You either agree with his attitude or yours doesn't count. You must do this, you must do that. My way is best, no other way counts runs all through this book. He is uncompromising and dictatorial and I'd hate to crew for him. I also wonder  if his family life is as described in the book as it sounds so soap opera stereo typical, incidents pulled right from a tv show. It is not much help if you don't have money as he writes from a position of starting off with  a healthy amount. All in all there are many more interesting and accurate and helpful books on this subjec 
 I am getting so frustrated at the number of books from alleged experts in a subject.  Maybe they know their material, but their knowledge didn't make it to print without a significant amount of damage.  Would it that be hard to have someone unfamiliar with the book try to complete the exercises before they publish it 
 This is a play on the classic version on this story. I think the story is akwardly layed out and that there isn't much to it. I LOVE Alison Jay's illustrations, in fact that's what made me decide to buy it. The story didn't live up to my expectations. 
 This is a surprisingly poor movie. Although it has some well-known actors, and a notable director, the material was just presented badly and predictably - like a lousy late night TV-movie with profanity inserted to liven it up.  The movie makes a simplified joke of the legal system and its sterotypical failings (though legitimate in many cases). It also glosses over the grieving process of the family, ignores the normal safety warnings to the remaining child, overdoes Kiefer Sutherland's character flaws (which are considerable nevertheless), and generally oversimplifies everything into a neat package to which you already know the ending because of the spoiler title.  In one particularly-bad scene, after taking martial arts classes and other measures to prepare herself mentally and physically, Sally's character simply stares open-mouthed and dumbfounded at Keifer's character when they meet on the street and he talks to her.  I don't know what I missed that the 4- and 5-star reviewers like so much. I only see wide-spread mediocrity.  I would only recommend this for fans of Keifer. "Ssssssorry", Sally, not your best role or movie. Ditto Ed Harris, whose other movies I generally like.  
 Face Dances should have never been made.  Townshend, the Who's chief songwriter, put all his best post-Moon material on Empty Glass, leaving table scraps for this album.  The music is pop-synth oriented, uninspired and bloody boring.  "Don't Let Go the Coat" and "Cache Cache" ("...there ain't no bears in there, cache cache..." huh?) are embarrasing.  Other than "You Better You Bet," the songs are forgetful at best.  Poor Kenny Jones has been the target of Who fan anger for 25 years, but this lackluster album was not his fault.  He was just the drummer.  Face Dances is lousy because of the songwriting, not the drumming.    As a live act, the Who was good enough with Mr. Jones on the skins, and it makes sense that they tried to jump start their careers with him.  Understandably, the band was shaken after Keith's death, but why even bother putting out new material this bad?  At least the next Who mach II album, It's Hard, had some great songs.   Even with the bonus tracks, Face Dances is a bargain bin album.  Don't waste your money on this; go out and get Empty Glass, All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes and It's Hard.  
 These are the "arm candy" of knives.  They're pretty to look at but are essentially useless.  My blades began rusting a day after I used them.  I've only had them since Christmas and am shopping for replacements as we speak.  Don't by these 
 I watched this film as part of my history studies in Post-War Europe and before everyone docks me because I gave it two stars, hear me out.  I'm no Godard fan so I may not be able to appreciate this film as a fan of The New Wave might.  I'm just your regular Joe Movie-Watcher.  Masculin Feminin is about Paul, a 21-year-old French citizen that just retired from his 16 months in the Army.  Paul is a believer in Marxism and throughout the film promotes the Worker's Party while denouncing US involvement in Vietnam, the Du Gaulle government and most forms of Westernism such as condoms, psychadelic rock (many songs in Masculin Feminin have a style similar to The Kinks, Jefferson Airplane etc) and even Coca-Cola... yet Paul is often seen playing pinball and that mini-bowling game you see at an arcade.  Paul seems to be the pro-French identity kind of guy as he often eats cheese and drinks wine.  The preserver of the romanticized French culture.    However, Paul's friends and interviewees (Paul works for the IFOP, the major French polling agency at the time) seem to not care about the change towards a quasi-American consumer state.  Paul's girlfriend Madelein is a rising pop-singer, her room mates are materialistic consumers, one who owns a car, and the people Paul interviews seem to only care about themselves.  This is very accurate in terms of how the 'baby-boom' generation of French youth began to rebel against the traditionalist governments in Europe.  Like the teens in the 1950s in the US, the teens began to form their own demographic.  However, this is where my fascination ends.  Godard apparently never heard of music editing and film editing.  In many parts in the movie, Godard fixed the camera on one person's face in a portrait shot and kept it there for minutes at a time even though the scene was a 15-minute back and forth conversation.  The volume in the music went from very high to very low instantly in many parts during dialogue, making it very annoying if almost distracting to the audience.    In a few parts when Paul was whistling, the recording of the whistling obviously overloaded the sound buffer as I heard static in the speakers.  I thought this was a volume problem on my end so I turned it down, nope... it was the sound editing.  This is just poor recording and editing.  Furthermore, the sound editors had this fascination with using the same gun-noise sound (which sounded more like a cartoon car noise) over and over and over again and in very unlikely times.    Other times, ambiant noises would drown out the dialogue such as vehicles from outside a cafe or even drinking noises.  Sometimes the sound didn't kick in for up to five seconds into the scene.    Because this is a French New Wave film, I won't attack how there is virtually no plot and has random scenes that are just plain silly.  However, I strongly recomend not getting this film if you're just in the general audience and not a New Wave fan.  Otherwise, you might like this New Wave classic but I'm no expert on the subject.  I was just extremely disapointed with the lazy filming, recording and editing.  
 I purchased this camera for my 13-yr old daughter as her first digital camera. It was a Christmas present so I am highly dissapointed that 3 months after purchase, the flash stopped working. The picture quality was good but it hardly makes up for the fact that she can no longer take photo's indoors or in low light. I would not recommend this camera. 
 It was my first and it was quite disjointed. I didn't finish it. Not a beginner scifi book even though it may be a classic. Too weird for me 
 I ordered the magazine and immediately received my first issue, but unfortunately over the course of the year I only received a total of THREE issues! The magazine is great, but I wonder what the problem is. I have no received much help from amazon or Modern Bride. Guess I learned my lesson not to subscribe online anymore. 
 If you've read anything already about these techniques - writing it down, visualizing it, tithing - this book offers no additional insights. And despite his "Official Religious Disclaimer" at the beginning of the book, it is packed to the rafters with the author's own religious dogma. If you share the author's religious outlook you may like this book, but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading 
 Having ploughed through Mr Beckerman's sophomoric ramblings in 'Death to All Cheerleaders', I thought that perhaps, just maybe, given a more focused agenda (as opposed to scattershot bitching at a bunch of easy targets) Marty might produce something of lasting value. Instead we've been given a truly dreadful, sleazy paean to adolescent sexual nihilism. And why not, eh! Bound to sell a few books. Except...well, if badly written nonsense purporting to be the truth, hollow shock journalism, facile theorising and extremely suspect personal anecdotes are your cup of chai, then you might enjoy yourself. For everyone else, I'd leave this well alone. Marty clearly shows his influences, namely Fitzgerald, Thompson and Burroughs with a big healthy injection of Brett Easton Ellis, without ever once displaying any of their wit and style. Ultimatly this is nothing more than a sickly wallow in base human behaviour by a sneering, loutish dunce with a few 10 dollar words, plagiarised attitudes and pretensions to insight. The exploitative manipulation of a few pathetic minors is just the icing on that particular cak 
 This book is very detailed in studying the level of organizations in the work setting. Must chapters seem like they take forever to read and get a grasp on. When I was finished reading it I found the information to be very overwhelming and hard to remember. It might be a good book solely to use as a reference. I would not recommend it to anyone. 
 This toaster is so adorable but it's really not worth the trouble. The bread takes a while to toast and when it's finished, Hello Kitty's head is barely visible. The only way to get her to show up would be by actually burning the bread. Opt for the waffle or sandwich maker instead--they're so much better 
 Okay, the rating above is not going to be liked but I have to be truthful.  The only good thing going for this movie was the return of "Snake Plissken".  This film's plot was essentially a rehash of the original "Escape From New York"...A bit more special effects (which in fact, did not make this a better movie)...   When I go to a sequel I expect to get what I paid for a totally new adventure with the same character / characters.  Kurt Russell's character is older and even more in the know of what the rewards are before he is offered them.   Obviously the movie doesn't really know where it's going as it takes two scenes (15 minutes of the film) (1st scene - President, Commandant, and Lackey give Snake the mission) (2nd scene - Commandant and Lackey brief Snake before he leaves for the mission)  to explan to the audience what's the basic conflict.  I guess either Carpenter or Russell are just getting too old to take a GREAT leap and recount either an earlier Snake Plissken adventure or an adventure well worth telling..  I also wish to comment that this disc has no special features besides a movie trailer... "Carpenter....Russell! " Please don't tell me "money" caused you to revisit a "cult figure"!   Some redeeming qualities are the acting performances of  Cliff Robertson, Stacy Keach, Steve Buscemi, and Pam Grier.  Robertson, Keach, and Grier may be old but they can sure make you believe in their characters!  Sorry, Snake...."I don't love L.A."  The-Big-Green-Pointy-Eared-One!  
 This is like those "tutorials" you find for computer programs: after the satisfied customer stumbles through it, they know nothing.  If you read books like a goat eats dead grass, leaves, old paper and discarded rubbers, you'll read this, too, probably. If you want to rip people off, go out and find a certified con man. Do time. This guy just burns up his word processor and your money. "Get rich quick. Buy and sell real estate". NO! Publish junk 
 I have the feeling that Mr. Luciano was running out of ideas with this book.  The only reason to read this book is for the inside accounts from the average players that the author enlists to fill out this book. This book is okay, if you are looking for a quick, light read 
 "I really take Nietzsche to town"--this is a quote from Marilynne Robinson. I heard her say this once at a writer's workshop in Saratoga Springs shortly before this collection, The Death of Adam, was printed. Who would SAY such a thing? It's not that one cannot argue with Nietzsche's thought--but "take him to town"? One may recall Rush Limbaugh, for instance, who, whenever he is under fire for getting someone angry, responds, "That's because I'M RIGHT."   Her book never gets much more intelligent than her quote.   The reviewer who said Robinson has an axe to grind here was right! These essays are well written but often full of a grudging and largely uninformed conservative viewpoint. Like many books that espouse such views, this one seems to see itself as some kind of enlightening  alternative to the "accepted" wisdom about contemporary science and morality. Bosh!     This book was written out of sheer discomfort. Robinson doesn't seem to have given writers such as Darwin and Nietzsche the kind of reading they deserve--that is, the type in which the reader does not immediately discount all ideas that seem like they will lead to undesirable consequences (Nietzsche and Darwin led to Hitler, that kind of tiresome cliche). Come now Marilynne, didn't we get enough of that kind of thing listening to the frat boys argue with the professor in Humanities Seminar back in freshman year? For one who sets out to undermine accepted wisdom, Robinson espouses it in ludicrous amounts.    If you don't happen to agree with Robinson already, most of her thinking will jump out as the usual smokescreen behind which essentially conservative thinkers carry out their specious assault on everything that makes them uncomfortable. 
 First of all, this review is based on what I got out of this graphic novel.  I may be very dense and can't understand subtle humor of this nature.  I found several parts of this humorous, but most of the time I was confused and lost in the story and where it was going and why it was going that route.  Maybe it wasn't supposed to make sense and I just didn't get it.  It any case, the art was, to say the least, incredible and visceral.  I would definitely get another penned by this artist.  But the story left me confused and somewhat disturbed 
 For the last time, America was not founded as a christian nation, the Founders were uniformly hostile either to the christian religion or to the traditional "Trinitarian" churches.  America's secular destiny was and continues to be hijacked by zealots as (or more) dangerous as the religiously motivated terrorists they so often decry.  This book is their rallying ground and their manifesto.  I advise every true patriot to go out and buy as many copies as you can reasonably afford.  Then burn them 
 pitt certainly gives us a descriptive account of life in California before the gold rush and after.  his referring to so many names and families did make the whole story of the people a little confusing 
 I first saw this film as a kid. At the time, I really enjoyed the movie. It's very colorful and I liked the tunes and it had Stubby Kaye. What kid wouldn't like Stubby Kaye?  But I just purchased it out of curiosity and was pretty much floored by how bad this movie is. The print transfer was great, and the quaility and color are everything one could hope to see. And if you like looking at very beautiful women in costumes that accentuate their best physical qualities, then I have to say it fits that bill. It's worth the price just to see Julie Newmar as Stupefyin' Jones.  However, the movie just isn't worth the time. The musical numbers are not very good. The direction isn't what one would hope. The casting wasn't very good, either, with most performers seeming to stroll through their roles, or in some cases just examples of some really bad acting. Yes, it was caricature and an adaptation of a musical of a comic strip filled with fantastic folk. But in some cases the portrayals were so over-the-top as to induce groans.  One thing I was surprised to note was the brief appearance of Jerry Lewis. I'd forgotten that he had the cameo.  If you have some fond childhood memories of this movie, then it's worth a look. Or if you just want to see the faithful adaptation of the female comic strip characters to flesh and blood actresses, then you'll probably like it.  If you you're looking for decent music and effective dance numbers and an enjoyable storyline, then you won't care for L'IL ABNER 
 I had a Wahl Clipper pair before. It was a good pair of clippers. The pair I owned previously was white and black as pictured in your ad. That was the pair I wanted again. The pair I have now does not perform like the previous pair. So I'm stuck with the pair Ihav 
 I am 88. All my life I have loved my English History & the English Countryside. I have travelled in all the old 52 Counties of England & Wales. Against this background I find that Alison Weir has written the best historical Biography & the best History I have ever read. Of the criticised detail; for me,the Topography is a bonus. Overall the detail provides the facts. Most Professional Historians patronise the lay reader by relegating the facts to references or footnotes. Then by a deliberatively cultivated oersonal style they present their interpretaions of the facts as the correct history. Alison Weir allows the reader to make his own interpretation of the facts as well as a judgment on her own interpretation of them. I have not yet even read all the book - as you know its delivery was delayed - but I have read enough to know that each remaining page will continue to give me increasing delight. I end with one of many personal experiences reading this superb book.        "In August 1924 I had a family seaside holiday at Walton on the Naze. One evening there was an adventurous expedition with other families to walk 'Round the Point'. As a child of 6 I remember clearly seeing in the evening sunlight the grassy mound with a few rocks where the castle once stood. No mention was ever made then or later to this being the place where Isabella had spent her first night in England on her return. In fact our families' expedition was a memorable occasion as there were several children for the adults to safeguard & we were nearly cut off by the incoming tide. Now my memory of that shingled shore is enhanced,not by nostalgia,but knowledge. 
 I bought this for my 2 yr old daughter.  I was so surprised at the quality for Little tykes.  It has no storage and the refridgerator door would not stay closed.  I think it should cost half of what it does.  I purchased the Step Two kitchen when my daughter was three, and it is way better by far 
 My 21 month old toddler loved the star crayon, and so did I initially.  However, during its first use the red crayon fell out of the plastic holder.  The problem is the shape of the crayon is like a round piece of candy.  My son picked it up and was about to put it in his mouth when I saw what had happened.  Personally, I would not use the product given the choking hazard that it presented.  Otherwise, I would use it with care and watch your child carefully as they play with the product.  
 Does anyone know when the next 'breakthrough' diet book will be released? I just feel so lost without a new 'diet' to try....you know, like one that uses fancy sounding terms to make things sound official and important and even though I have no idea whether it's true of not even after I've read it, it just sounds to complex to be false....or maybe one that will reaffirm many of my current bad eating habits so I don't feel guilty....and hey, if I can loose weight on it....that's a bonus. I haven't found any diet book yet that fits any of the described categories above, but hey, I'm looking.  Thanks for you interest 
 I give it two stars only because the two mystery's are decent.  This is some of the worst writting I have found in a long time of reading.  The dialogue is totally unrealistic and the writing is awful.  I don't know how much Patterson had to do with this book but he should be ashamed.  I ask you  how many women do you know that use a term like "skirt hound" for a man who chases women?  I actually listen to this book as an unabridged audio, thinking it would sound better than it read...silly me!  It was even worst because I had to hear the actor read the awful dialogue.  Even my wife, who is a big Patterson fan, disliked this one 
 I have enjoyed almost all her other works but this one was a waste of money and time.  I couldn't force myself to get to the end.  Continually I turned the page in hopes it would get better but it didn't.  The way she moves the point of view from Katharine back to the story is not enjoyable.  I would hate not to enjoy Philippa Gregory again but this one will make me think twice before paying full price again 
 This book was OK. I had to read it for school but I agree that it had way too many narrations in it and the only thing that captured the teens' feelings and thoughts were the scant entries from their diaries. This book didn't move me at all. If the author had put more of the kids' entries in it, it might be more effective 
 With such a beautiful cover and such a career to discuss, I was very exicted about reading this book.  But OH MY GOD it was painful.  I'm sorry Mr Burns, but I don't care what your personal feelings are about Curtis.. I wanted to read about Curtis' life.. what he went through, how he came to write such beautiful music - but instead you give track by track detail of every album - and thats it.  Here's hoping someone can write an interesting book about such an inspirational man 
 Meredith Ann Pierce is hands down my favorite author of all time, but I really didn't see the point to this book.  The stories were often scattered and irratic, lacking clear plot, character development and resolution.  Some stories would have made better whole novels, and others, I am sorry to say, should have been left out of print.  Still, I enjoy her writing style and the presentation of worlds in many ways similar to our own but with added elements of magic and fantasy.  I hope Ms. Pierce's next endeavor is more along the lines of the Firebringer or Darkangel trilogies.  Those were truly great works of literature 
 Being a fan of such authors as J.R.R. Tolkien, H.G. Wells, and C.S. Lewis, I figured I'd try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the American West, a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining. I did some research and Cormac McCarthy seemed to be the author to start with.  He got very good reviews (from this site and professional critics).  I find it amazing that he received such great reviews... this book failed to impress me in the slightest bit.  The book seemed to fly away from the plot for a while and suddenly, unexpectedly return to it.  I have never read a book like that before.  After completing this book I had found out more about the life of a prostitute than I ever wanted to know and also I received a free lesson in swearing.  I understand that it was custom in the West to swear, and dealings with prostitutes was common, but I think McCarthy went over the top.  This made it uninteresting and redundant.  Then there was the fact that he rarely used punctuation other than periods, question marks, and exclamation marks.  I did not see a single quotation mark and the word "and" was excessevely overused due to the exclusion of commas.  Dialogue was at times hard to follow and seemingly run-on sentences were monotonous.  After reading this book I also felt ignorant being uneducated in the Spanish language.  Much of the dialogue I could not understand in the least bit.  There were entire conversations written exclusively in Spanish at times when it seemed relevant.  I felt like I missed a lot of important information in the story. I did find that at time McCarthy did use some beautifully crafted language but the formerly mentioned factors left a very bad impression on me.  I don't suppose I'll ever read a book by Cormac McCarthy again 
 I brought this video because of the good reviews it received. I would not reccommand this video to anyone. The picture quality isn'tvery good. It looks like a homemade video. The music is very annoying. Along with the music you hear (breath through you sexual core, Etc..) The sound is not good. It sounds kind of hollow. Like there's a slight echo. I really don't have anything good to say about this dvd. I can't tell you about Volume II or III because I was very disappointed in I. The only reason I gave this dvd 2 stars is because the moves are so bad 
 Any of the info provided in the book is pretty much common knowledge unless you are completely clueless.    A lot of the info is just joking around and being JA's.  Plus, I'm sorry, but the authors look like they could quite possibly be into eachother (noted in book about experimenting in homosexuality).  So, why would anyone want to learn how to be a gentleman from these fools?  Not me, but I had a few laughs here and there.  If you're not looking for substance, this is it.  If you want a few laughs here and there, get it if you are bored 
 This New Testament seems to fill a gap in the market, but I question whether that gap is real or percieved. Many others have commented that it is helpful in that it allows them to read without getting frustrated at their lack of vocabulary knowledge. If that is the case, then great! In a very important way, who am I (or who is any reviewer) to knock a book like this if it gets someone excited about reading the GNT.  However...  I believe that the general level of excitement in many of these posts is misplaced. First, to get any use out of this volume, one must know NT vocabulary down to 30 occurrences. I think this is about 500-600 words (all I know is that 50 occurrences if about 350). Once you know those, in my opinion you are ready for the "real thing," i.e. go get a UBS4 (not an NA27). The UBS4 is very user-friendly and has a basic dictionary. This Zondervan product sounds like a Panacea of Greek information to read some of the reviews. It is not.  Second, I would not purchase this volume, nor recommend it, simply based on the fact that it uses backwards engineering to arrive at its Greek text. I don't know why this is even remotely acceptable to anyone. Why not just translate an English version into ancient Greek? That is more or less what this version is. Simply put, why introduct this sort of error into a Greek text that will be widely read by many people? I just don't understand it.  So, at the end of the day, if you want to read the GNT, buy a UBS4 edition (NOT an NA27) and start reading 
 Hank Hanegraff is a blatant replacement theologian where the nation of Israel is concerned.  He is further from the truth where prophecy is concerned than most groups, to include pretribulationists.  Indeed, his "scholarship" is no scholarship at all; it is pure propaganda....  To see real scholarship, get Tim Cohen's materials (see below):  Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, Zola Levitt, Thomas McCall, John Hagee, Grant Jeffrey, Marlin Maddox, Perry Stone, Texe Marrs, John Walvoord (deceased), etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's site for details on these items, which are also available via Amazon) 
 A slow, loggy movie about a philandering husband (everyone was guessing this was Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein in the Nora Ephron novel on which the movie is based; he was Ephron's husband). Jack Nicholson plays the husband and Meryl Streep the wife, and both are uncharacteristically bland. There is hardly anything to the story: they marry, she gets pregnant, he gets restless and wanders. We finish watching knowing and caring as little about all this as when we started. Very dull 
 I found this book very confusing and the sections just don't match together. There are better books out there for sure 
 Dershowitz is supposed to be a college professor, yet he consistently cuts and pastes sources from Joan Peters fraud, From Time in Memorial.  Norman Finkelstein all proves without any shadow of doubt that this book has manipulated figures from prominent Jewish historian Benny Morris.  Finkelstein debated Dershowitz on Democracy Now about this issue.  Despite Dershowitz's constant interruptions I believe it is the most intertaining debate I have ever seen.  Please download it from Finkelstein's website if you have time.  Dershowitz is just one example of people contributing to the distortion history and creating a fog to the real crisis in Palestine.   
 Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."  I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives.  
 Although it is obvious that the author has researched his subject thoroughly, unfortunately the book leaves a lot to be desired: full of digressions tangentially related to the subject offered with a writing style that is sterile and outright depressing, the author regrettably fails to make his point.    I also would had expected that Princeton Press would had done a better job at editing the manuscript (especially eliminating bromides and cliches) as well would had made an effort to include a few diagrams and pictures to aid the reader at following the clinical description of the containerization standards 
 The book is not well organized even though the organization is very important for such a book with a lot of contents 
 The 2001 printing of this book is full of errors.  The author's errata list is 71 pages long.  Get the 2nd printing: paperback with updated CDROM.  I'm going to be returning mine 
 I have the older, larger version of this product. However, it uses the same software. The labels are great and the spring device that is used to apply the labels is great, but the software is awful. There is no direct Macintosh program; rather there are templates. They were written for old versions of software and really don't work right. The Windows side includes an actual Print Shop-style program which works awfully. If you do get this, make your own template on AppleWorks or PowerPoint 
 This book was written 1n 1993.... even though the basics remain the same, there are other books on the subjet like the ones written by Myra Savant-Harris that are 100% more updated 
 Having received a minor in Mathematics in college, I was confident that I could take something of value from this book but I'm afraid that was not the case.  I can't imagine what kind of feeling a person who wasn't as familiar with Math would be left with.  The hypothesis set forth in the book amounts to nothing.  The author doesn't satisfy the needs of the reader.  He leaves them out to dry without finalizing any aspect of his "report."  Neither does he supply the reader with any reasons as to why solving this problem would be useful.  He simply says that there are many reasons, without naming them.  I, personally, cannot think of any good use for the theorem that predicts the frequency of prime numbers.  There may be a good reason though and that's what I wanted from the author.  The last complaint I have is with the superfluous and pointless charts, graphs, tables and diagrams.  They do nothing but confuse the reader more.  The book is well researched.  It paints a nice picture of the history of Mathematics(traced all the way back to the Ancient Greeks) and it clearly defines the progression of the study of prime numbers.  It also provides biographical information on some of the most brilliant mathematicians ever including Gauss and Euler but I don't think that's what the author intended to be the best part of the book.  If you want a historical and biographical account of the study of Mathematics, I'm sure there are better books out there.  This one fails to deliver on the importance and the future of the Riemann Hypothesis 
 This movie is for liberals what the Left Behind book series is for Christian conservatives, it portrays reality how they want to see it. Its like they wanted to make a good story but tried too hard to cram as much PC political propaganda in as possible and ended up ruining it. Entertaining in some parts but pretty dumb overall IMO 
 The above book was truly one of the first "big people" books I read about 2 years ago. This may surprise a few people, but I always hated reading. Religion inspired me to read and read and read. When I first picked up Rescuing the Bible from Fundamentalism by Bishop Spong (Episcopal), I thought this was going to be an interesting book. Indeed it was. In the early days of my "re-search" for my faith, I was moving out of a secularized and atheistic mindset, so understandably I had a distaste for the "rules and regulations" of  a Church system like I grew up in, that is the Catholic Church. One of my best friends was or I should say, still is a lesbian. So how could I have reconciled the basic tenets of the Christian faith with the lifestyle of my friend? Well, as I read this book, Bishop Spong actually gave the answer: St. Paul, writer of many of the New Testament books, was a homosexual, albeit a celibate homosexual. This seemed quite revolutionary to me, indeed it still is, but I later found out that many scholars have been using this as way to justify homosexuality. After reading that book, I honestly felt like it was the Gospel truth. I didn't stop to think about how much of the book really used very little Scripture to justify his claims. Looking back on it, "Father Spong's" argumentation was more like a Psychoanalytic dissection of Paul's behaviors which may or may not have signified what Spong claimed. For example, does Paul's admission of a sin which he is struggling with mean that he is homosexual? Perhaps... But, there is absolutely no basis for his assertions either from a proper exegesis of the text or the Tradition of centuries of Church history. It's almost as absurd as the "revelations" of the Da Vinci Code.   I would not recommend this book, but I think a solidly formed Christian can read it for a good laugh. Bishop Spong has been a very controversial teacher and speaker for the last few decades. He is certainly a contribution to the potential of an Episcopal Schism in America. Indeed, in recent year, over a hundred Eposcopal Priests have converted to Roman Catholicism and have take many of their flock with them. Let us stand proudly with the Catholic Church to say that there exists only one Church, as Dr. Peter Kreeft has said on many occasions, which does not take it upon herself to edit God's Word.   God Bless, Laurence Gonzaga 
 This may be great a product, but you won't find out through Amazon. After waiting months and getting numerous postponement e-mails from Amazon, I finally cancelled my order. Although Amazon claims this DVD is available, I have a feeling I was never going to receive it. If you're interested, I suggest looking for another vendor 
 It is sad that these two southern hip-hop legends good names have been blemished by Bad Boy records.  The transformation from their classic hit "on the outside looking in" along with a host of other great albums to this disgrace is quite sad.  I'm sure your boy puffy offered alot more money and fame than they have ever had in the underground, and it hurt 'em.  Some will say "well thats what you get for being a sell out" but if your in the game making underground hits for almost 2 decades and your only know to a small region, you may not feel the accomplishment or respect you deserve.  I forgive them, not Puffy.  Buy some of their old stuff 
 Joni, how many of these re-hashes will there be?  If you are not going to make any new music, then how about publishing some art books featuring your paintings?  I am sure you would find a good world-wide market for them.  Screw the art galleries, take your work straight to the people! Many of your fans would delight in a different aspect of your phenomenal talent.  But this serial recycling of the past must stop!  The original albums are all superior to these collections 
 This is a very short book (126 pages) that combines moments of some depth with moments of utter silliness. Most of it is a sparse but sympathetic study of a girl who is adopted by her aunt after her parents die horribly, is a bit of a misfit at school, goes into ballerina training and develops anorexia. Which is all OK; a bit wrenching to read in places, but engaging. Then she is wonderfully cured of anorexia, falls in love withe the Right Man, and shoots the author. Yes, that is how the book ends, and I do not apologise for spoiling it; it is such a stupid ending that it deserves no respect 
 I knocked this book from someone that ordered it, but got to the store after me :-).  I made the mistake to buy the book by the sound of its title.  And author.  I fell for it this time..... It is not the first Konstantinos text I buy and must say, this one helped me make up my mind.  It seems highly obvious that the author is abusing the commercial value of the "black arts" to get to the spectrum of rebellious teenagers that would "sell their soul" just to make a statement at large.  Well well, if that aren't following the routes of the christian church we so dire to critisize.... The practical aspects are not well thought through and I suspect, just as unknown to the author as to the guys that made the front page.  Practise is either made as difficult as possible, or serves as an example of the inability of the author to explain some basic concepts. It does show that the author is jack of all trades, but master of none. I would advise readers that are seriously interested in the topic to acquire the texts of Frater U.D., which I find much more fascinating, as well as educational.  I would therefore advise this text for any pseudo-black-art-wannabe with little interest in the occult.  
 I originally picked up this book because it seemed like it had gotten some decent reviews.  I can't stay that I enjoyed the novel very much, mostly because it was slow moving, the characters were all over the place, and the ending was weak.  Don't waste your time reading this novel, pick up something better like The Kite Runner, which has a lot more substance 
 I read Flags of Our Fathers and enjoyed it more than Flyboys.  Bradley has a writing style that is difficult at times as has personal biases come through very clearly.  As one other reviewer has written, I found it very odd that he often referred to MG Curtis LeMay as "Curtis."  As someone writing about military history, Bradley should have more respect for the uniform and should not call a two star general by his first name like he is talking about one of his golfing buddies.  This was very distracting.  I also found the first couple of chapters of his history lesson very tedious and unfocused - so much so that I nearly quit reading the book.  The latter chapters pick up the pace and are insightful.  Bradley also devotes too much time attempting to demonize the American firebombing tactics.  Thankfully Bradley's bias and negativity toward the Navy and Army is not as pronounced in Flyboys as in FOOF.  This bias is especially odd considering his father was a Navy Corpsman.  
 First and foremost, I think that the idea that the Avengers were something that needed to be 'fixed' is a given: In an era where the continuity and consistancy, for what it was, of the Marvel Universe is largely ignored, this series fits. Too many people wanted the 'X-men' to be the model of the Avengers, and simply put, it could never happen. 'Avengers Disassembled' did indeed generate interest, did indeed act to launch 'the New Avengers' and 'Young Avengers', and did propel BMB forward as the main writer for too many Marvel titles...    But it is piss poor as a comic.  Brian Michael Bendis is not a bad writer. Simply put, his other work such as 'Powers' is decent. The problem here is that the strength of the Marvel Universe has always been both exciting storytelling, but the continuity and interconnected nature of the MU. The Avengers represented that strength, perhaps better than any other group. What Bendis did was simply pander to both the 'newer' reader, and in some ways became overzealous in the desire to make a 'different, all-new' Avengers, by completely destroying the 'Old Avengers'.  The problem is, 'Avengers Disassembled' is schlock. It's not even good writing. It has many issues that were simply ignored for the sake of shock. Continuity, pacing, characterization, and importantly the resolution, leaves the reader with a bad taste in their mouth, and more importantly, sets a trend that fractures and destroys the house that Stan and Jack built. The Scarlet Witch? Come on.....that is reaching....why couldn't it be Loki, the villain who 'Created' the Avengers? Why does it have to be the continually over-used 'Enemy Within' story? This was simply sub-par work from a writer who has better talent and skill. I think personally BMB couldn't wait to start 'New Avengers', and forgot that there were Avenger fans out there.   To me, A:D could have been so much more, something that really defined the next generation of Marvel writers and fans, but instead acted to alienate the older and dedicated fans in lieu of appealing to the younger generation. A:D could and *SHOULD* have been the pentultimate chapter in the Avengers, but instead all it is known for is the launch of the next series, the 'death' of Hawkeye, and the inability to really bridge the gap between the 'old Avengers' and 'New Avengers'.   I expected more, I got less. 
 The conversations and actions of the characters were totally unbelievable. I had to force myself to finish the book 
 With record or near-record numbers of divorces and unmarried adults, a supposed shortage of available men, dwindling marriage and birth rates, the seeming social acceptance of fatherless "families" and the social pathologies they produce in many of their children, the scary rise of religious fundamentalism, etc., it'll be the last few chapters of this book that most people will be particularly interested in.  Up to those final pages this is mostly a banal if readable partial re-telling of a lot of familiar material.  There's a lot of what I'd consider trivial detail mixed in, which could come in handy if you want to sound mildly interesting and erudite at cocktail parties.  But it obscures a lot of what's really going on, or has gone on in the past.  Any emphasis even on the basic shift from the religious/sacred nature of marriage to its more modern secular/contractual nature (not that it's much of a contract now) is pretty well lost in the noise.  And the origin of marriage gets very much fuzzified.  The roles and activities of men are so nearly absent through much of the book -- except when they're beating their wives -- that the book often slips into being a history of women more than it is of marriage.  It might not be too much to say the book's main accomplishment is in being a feminist-friendly telling of the story which doesn't use virtually any feminist jargon.  And Coontz has an occasional but constantly recurring and therefore annoying tendency to sound like she's got an axe to grind with the religious/wingnut crowd.  If so, she should have taken them on directly and written a different sort of book.  As it is it contaminates the history.  Consequently the ending fizzles and doesn't seem like a very convincing explanation for any of the current puzzling phenomena.  If good history helps us understand the present and how we got here, this book isn't very good.  I think this is basically because Coontz's model is flawed.  Dealing with linear time (and ignoring insignificant zig-zags) she makes the mistake of thinking things are part of a strict progression from A to B.  Hence, there's no going back in her view to "the way things were", which seems to be her real contention -- that whatever recent changes have occurred are permanent, so like-it-or-not we better get used to them.  Don't humans have choice?  Isn't change something of a constant?  Instead, I would recommend the advantages of an entirely different model than her's, one in which there are two distinct and perpetually competing systems (rather than some continuum), and that what we're now doing is *reverting back* to the basic animal/casual/matriarchal system -- the "love marriage" centers around mother/child biology, with men making their various appearances or orbits before exiting -- which prevailed for the tens of thousands of years before the invention of civilization, patriarchal marriage, and stable prosperous families.  But the love marriage is too concerned with the basics of survival and minimal sustenance to have much time for the luxury of intimacy, and it contains very little love.  With "marriage" in the industrial west these days being little more than notorized dating, and conferring no substantive rights whatsoever on men, I'd even contend we've reverted a very long way back: having gone from A to B, and then back to A again.  So there's no real reason why B might not come back in favor again sometime in the future if that's where we decide to go.  It certainly has mountains of misinformation and propaganda heaped up against it currently.  However, its obscure but important advantages could easily be rediscovered and come back in vogue, wearing (of course) slightly different clothes.  It embodies much of what people seem to long for.  But such is outside the range of possibilities in the limited model Coontz presents for us.  This book might be OK if one knows next to nothing about the history of marriage and intends to read several quite different books on it to get a variety of perspectives, but beware anyone regarding it as a bible.  It's merely "a" history, so it's by no means definitive 
 This book is a good reference to have on the shelf. I would not recommend reading it or buying it unless you have nothing else to do 
 The book's premise was so promising -- how to find work that fulfills your higher calling.  The book just never fulfills that promise.  Just a lot of unmemorable writing about how you will be more fulfilled if your work is meaningful.  Well, that's not a shocker.  But how about some insight into how to find or how to create meaningful work.  For such a deep and spiritual topic, the thinking was very superficial.  The author merely rewrites what he has read elsewhere.  No new thinking.  Readers would be better off reading some of the books he recommends in his bibliography such as Flow and the books by Viktor Frankl.  I was also left with the icky feeling that the real point of this book was to sell you on his company's feel good workshops.  A real disappointment 
 The first 3 books of the Wayfarer Redemption where wonderful: great plot, characterization, and wonderful writing. However, the next three books in the series went from bad to worse. The series `continued' the story while changing the entire storyline; the character's where all very similar and predictable; and the writing was malicious at best. There was a lot of completely unnecessary violence, vague and unexplained concepts, and the ending was positively the worst conclusion of a tale that had began with such promise. I will NEVER be able to reread or forget the last 3 books of the Wayfarer Redemption series, and these last three books where so awful that they may have ruined the first three!! 
 I returned the book.  As I have a toaster over/rotisserie the book was not what I needed 
 A mere patchwork of aphorisms, Stewart Home's "Assault on Culture" fails because of its inflated gesture. The book debunks itself as a product of the very "lumpen intelligentsia" it ridicules since the dialectics of the notions sought to be criticized backlashes against their very critique: Although "The Assault on Culture" suggests being about "culture," the notion itself is not critically examined, but reinforced in the feuilletonistic sense of "the art world." This is manifest in such linguistic twists as the "cultural worker"Ñtautological if "culture" had been more thoroughly reflected, backlashing into re-affirmation of its replace-term nevertheless. While "The Assault on Culture" may be in itself as much an aporia as Neo-ism is an oxymoron, "The Assault on the Art World" would have described the project better, and left its terminological calamities more obviously unresolve 
 People, I love Covenant, they have become one of my favorite groups ever.  This is total tripe compared to everything else they have ever done.  It feels like they either gave up, or ran out of creativity.  If I was them I would be absolutely embarassed by this effort, because they are capable of soooo much more. The only track I like, and I really digit, is 20 Hz.  It is one of my favorite covenant tracks ever. Everything else? Garbage. Just being honest people, don't force yourself to like it just because it is Covenant 
 When people wonder why the urbane 'compassionate caring souls' are detested by, well virtually everyone else, just look to the elistist superficial hatemongers like Lebowitz. Thanks biatch, for causing a backlash against ALL those who want a more fair world, by giving them a giant target of elitist cancer. Those people, who, whatever their level of awareness may be, are certainly better human beings than a thousand of you.  Hate is not humor. Selfishness is not sophistication. 'Street' is not more real, it is so much less so. I've lived in New York for too many years, and can say it is the most provincial place I've been. Full of neurotic hatas like Fran.  What a simplistic one-note act. She loathes your existence  unless you fit into her microscopic selfish self-righteous world. If you don't you are a disgusting rube who should go kill yourself now. heh. that's funny stuff. What, you don't get it? didn't think so. kill yourself 
 The oral history approach by Ambrose & Co offers certainly has its attraction. And if this book would have consisted of personal accounts of D-Day veterans only, I think it would have made a valuable, insightful, and memorable account of this landmark battle.   Unfortunately, the author did not leave it at that but felt the need to present his own, highly biased and overly patriottic views on the various aspects of the battle. The message that is spelled out again and again, in capitals, is that only the American troops and their commanders showed excellence in planning and carrying out the battle. Their allies, in particular the British, receive considerably less credit or even scorn. For example, the book ridicules the supposed British craze for "gadgets", such as their mini-submarines and special tanks, which they nonetheless used very effectively on D-day.   But what really annoys me is the personal "battle" that Ambrose seems to be fighting with the long-beaten German foe: all the decisions they took on D-day were wrong in his opinion, they responded way too late or not at all, they failed to foresee the invasion, their command structure was inadequate, their navy did not intercept the fleet "which nobody could understand", etc. etc. The truth is that by june 1944 the Germans simply did not have the resources to fight an agressive and intelligent counter-battle on the Western front anymore. I find it disappointing, a little cheap and certainly inappropriate for a scholarly historian to keep on criticizing the past performance of an enemy with the comforts of hindsight and imaginary resources. (Even more so as the included number of German combattants' accounts in this book is less than a handful.)   By the end of this book, I was thoroughly fed up with the hollow rhetorics and "easy" truths like "The Wehrmacht's many mistakes [on D-day] were exceeded by those of the Luftwaffe, which was quite simply just not there" (ch 32). Perhaps this style is what it takes to write a bestseller, but "D Day: June 6, 1944" fails as a military history book. 
 I expected more from Wayne Wescott, Ph.D., who is often quoted by fitness magazines.  His name is well-known in the area of health and fitness research.  The book did not address sodium intake or give any recommendations for daily fat intake.  Caffeine was also not addressed.  It seems like these areas would be covered to some extent, given the book is about reducing cellulite.  The weight-training program did not advocate changing one's routine every 6 or 8 weeks to avoid plateaus.  I was excited to buy this book, but very disappointed at the lack of thoroughness on the part of the authors.  It just didn't seem to cover everything it should have, leaving this reader with many unanswered questions 
 More tripe about how one "man" discovered other humans.  The "objective" view of this man as a hero is still present, helping to perpetuate the myth that Natives were not as valuable as the oppressors who came to colonize them.  I am not the type to say burn books, but this would make great kindling for the fires of truth.  You might be able to use it in a discussion of racism and the epestimologies that help create and foster it.  There are plenty of Italian people who were heroes, this person is just not one of them.  
 This novel sucks. That's all I'm going to write about it 
 Kramer seems to think that we have strayed from the path of letting the People decide constitutional issues. There are significant reasons why Madison and others thought that would be a problem. Freedom of speech, for example, is something that the majority of voters or their representatives in congress would do away with in an instant if it weren't for the Supreme Court. Freedom of speech is fine until some group like the communists or the nazi party tries to exercise it, then legislators try to make laws saying they can't. In our constitution it is imperative to have a less political branch deciding these issues. Yes, the Supremes make unpopular decisions sometimes, but that is their job. Allowing the boneheads in congress to decide important constitutional issues would be folly. They would play to the lowest common denominator and have us giving away our rights in the name of God or security or morality. The Constitution has a way for the people to check the Supreme Court. We can impeach them or amend the constitution. Kramer's book looks back on the golden age in 1800 when we voted out a political party because of the unconstitutional laws they passed. Does he deny the havoc some poorly thought out laws could wreak in 21st century America? We don't have time to allow people to take away American's rights with the idea we might get them back in the next election 
 Sometime ago I read my Sunday paper and noted that "Three Junes" was listed as a popular book choice.  The title sounded interesting so I bought it.  That was 2 months ago and I am still trying to get through the paperback edition.  It is difficult to follow the timeline, to understand the characters and where they fit, and to get involved in the storyline.  I will finish the book because that's my style.  It has not been a book that I could not wait to get back to. 
 The Word is spiritual, not physical. Those who hope to gain wisdom from it must approach it as spiritual, not as a literal physical object. And, that is the problem with this work. James Robinson is a renowned scholar who has gone to great pains to provide accurate translations of the Nag Hammadi scriptures. But, there is little food for the soul here.  If you are a scholar, this is the book for you. But, if you are a seeker of spiritual truth, look elsewhere. I am a seeker and have owned this book for many months. I would not miss it if it disappeared from my personal library.  Seekers are advised to look elsewhere, starting with the older writings of G.R.S. Mead. 
 I had very high expectations of this book and looked forward for ages for its arrival and was thrilled when I was informed it had arrived.  Immediate disappointment occurred upon seeing the book, it is no taller than a compact disc and not much wider.  I was expecting a much larger book not one where the picture on Amazon is just about actual size.  Still if the content of the book had been superb I wouldn't have cared that much. Very average effort would be being nice describing what is inside.  The best three signs in the book are on the cover, most are pretty average and have been doing the rounds on the Internet for years.    While some locations are specific a lot of the credits are also rather vague so if you actually wanted to find the sign for yourself you'll have a bit of a mission.  Also some of these photographs have been cropped so all you see is the signs themselves and not what surrounds, meaning we are seeing them out of context and they are not that funny in real life.  For example the Bind Persons Cross Here sign with the vague location of Australia (is actually at Nobbys Beach, Gold Coast QLD) does not show the school for blind children which is right next to it nor the other signs next to it warning motorists on the Highway to slow down due to the crossing.           If you've been using e-mail for over a year or so you will no doubt have seen the majority of these signs before.  In fact the best ones you've seen there you will find are not in here.  Don't waste your money!   
 This was silly at the beginning, silly in the middle, and I don't what at the end given that I was so bored I stopped watching it halfway through. It intends to be funny but falls way short, the characters are annoying -the "spunky" daughter he suddenly inherits   is a willful smart-ass teenager, and the inspector is not convincing as a dad trying to protect his newfound daughter nor as a tough-cracking investigating officer. I regret the sleep I missed for this 
 This is a horrible failure of a book. It depends totally on its ending, and at the end, delivers nothing. It is the sort of book you throw at the wall.   It starts well. Fraught with potential, it captures your imagination,leads you along an interwoven tale full of incidents and detail. Little of substance happens, no characters develop, and no real story is built. But it carries you because it promises, again and again, that all that transpires is a part of the mystery that will be resolved at the end.   Surprise ! There is no resolution at the end. A character annouces that everything was made up (for reasons that make no sense). The tale descends into farce. There is a deluge, flooding, drowning. I could only think of the Poseidon Adventure. Everything is washed away except the bad taste left in your mouth.  The book does not offer enough to survive such a nonsensical ending. There are a score of books in this genre (Eco, Peares). Your time would be much better spent with one of those.  
 This "book" is probably the worst written I've ever encountered. It was so flawed as to be considered literature. Alice Walker tries to "One-up" Harriet Beecher Stowe, in writing about brutality. Titles like these are weapons used in the Anti-Black Male agenda this society has long perpetuated. All the men depicted in this book are one-dimensional characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities worth noting. The women are portrayed as martyred, forlorn, pseudo-saints who have been set upon by beasts from hell.   The only persons capable of any sort of humanity are exclusively women. I've learned long ago, when absolutes such as these are presented, a greater agenda is at work. There are no "real" men in this book! Only distorted caricatures of Black masculinity. I only found value in this book as a comprehensive example of sexist misandry at its worst. I find this title as dangerous as Hitler's "Mien Kampf", in it's portrayal of Black men as evil and morally destitute.   Presenting such depictions is both dangerous and irresponsible. True, there are criminally abusive men in every culture. But there are also forthright, upstanding  men as well. To present a depiction of such vehement imbalance and disparity, only serves to distort the readers view of the people being written about.   Harriet Beecher Stowe's fictional "Uncle Tom's Cabin", sparked national outrage and eventually a bloody civil war. This title does no less in further distorting the readers perceptions of Black Men.   This book is fiction. However,it is not presented as such. I'm sure the abusive incidents depicted in this book have been based upon actual incidents. I have no qualm about outrage at such abominations. However, I do have a problem when there are absolutely no upstanding male figures who intervene in such aberrations. That is what I find so unbelievable and offensive about this book.   In my opinion, this novel does nothing to laud the strength of women so much as it demeans and distorts the readers/viewers of the people within it. I don't find it a testament to the strength of Black Women at all. I interpret this book as feminist misandry with two purposes...the further distortion of African-American culture and the deliberate depiction and denigration of the Black Male as being hopelessly inhuman.  I'm sure Alice walker made a lot of money with this book. Feminist, racist extremism seems to have found a niche in literature. I wonder if this novel would have had the same accolades, were it a fictional depiction of White American Men brutalizing White Women. Most definitely not!!! I doubt it would have even found a publisher. America is comfortable reinforcing negative depictions of Black Men and African-American culture.  My life as a Black man is difficult enough living as a testament and example against this sort of racial distortion. Whatever Ms. Walker's motivations were in writing this novel, I'm sure mercenary incentives were not discounted.   This is racist, misandrist propaganda masquerading as literature!        
 The general reliability of this book can be derived from the famous Madalyn Murray O'hair's introduction to the Wagenseil version of the Toledot Yeshu, the Jewish Life of Jesus, included in Zindler's book (appendix A). She writes that the Church Father Origen undertakes to refute "a Jew named Celsus" in Origen's "Contra Celsus". Any middling student of the writings of Church Fathers knows that Celsus was not a Jew, but a Pagan, who sometimes uses the Jewish viewpoint in his arguments. This is the mistake of an enthusiastic amateur, and no scholar. It is also the view of someone who never read the sources used, but writes from second and third-hand knowledge, much like Mr. Zindler.  Add to this Zindler's use of unsubstantiated quotes, extreme arguments, and selective exclusions, and you come up with a book that falls tantalizingly short of useful. As an example, he writes of the absence in Jewish tradition of the rending of the veil of the temple upon Jesus' death. But surely a man who obviously read a huge amount of reference material happened upon the Talmudic descriptions of the strange self-opening of the Temple doors 40 years before the Destruction. No, the veil was not rent, and clearly the story in its present form in the Babylonian Talmud (tractate Yoma, 39b) is apocryphal. But the interesting coincidence of the year of occurrence, the time of Jesus' crucifixion, even if composed by the Rabbis centuries after the purported event, must have been purposefully excludud from Zindler's book. To use an expression the author himself has used in his book: He HAD to have known of it.  He does have a way with words... after all, argument is the meat and potatoes of the Atheist movement. Some of his criticisms are laugh-out-loud funny.   Having said all this, Zindler is right-on much of the time, with fascinating information well known to all students of the subject. But for a writer who prides himself on "true scholarship", he shoots himself in the foot with weak references and useless arguments. He claims that the populace HAD to have seen the dead who rose from their graves after the resurrection, but no one left a record of this event outside the Gospel, and therefore it didn't happen. Great argument, but how about:THE DEAD CAN'T WALK!  Unfortunately, many readers will not be sufficiently informed to separate the wheat from the chaff. This is a shame. All it takes is one patently false statement, one weak reference, to destroy the reliability of a book. Zindler has way too much of an axe to grind to be a competent scholar. There are many other books that cover the same questions, written by real scholars, that should be consulted by anyone wishing to explore this rich area of scholarship 
 The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because I love Benefit. That being said, this perfume is what we like to call a sleeper. It's so faint that you can hardly smell it, but when you do, it's not pleasing at all and you immediately scramble for something that smells better. If you are looking for a young, fun perfume, stay away from this one. It smells old and drab, like your grandmother's china cabinet or an antique store. But if you like that.. 
 Parts of this book are worth reading.  For example, the author claims the influence of genetics/food is bi-directional.  I found this claim provocative. However, the rest of the book is uninspiring.   Finally, I was puzzled that the author never addressed the claim that our taste buds have memories.  (Whether he agreed or disagreed.)  In other words, what we eat in our earliest moments of life, has an extremely strong influence on what foods we like (and eat) for the rest of our lives.  This issue has been discussed in the science of nutrition and child rearing for many years now.  Susan Robert's "Feeding Your Child for Life Long Health" is a great book that incorporates this fact into an every day guide for mom and dad.  (I preferred Robert's first edition. 
 Ok, the first half of this book does nothing more than talk about purchasing some DNA activation kit and joining the authors home base of practitioners.  Similar to the "cures they do not want you to know about" scam.  I will say that there is some good information in this book, but would not understand that had I not known about other holistic healing modalities that describe the same things.  This book appears to be a trademark promotion based on several other holistic philosophies.  More power to you if you can do it... but the author is going to have to come up with some original material.  This book didn't offer me anything I haven't read about or experienced before.    
 When I bought this book I was expecting a science fiction novel. I think this book is just a bunch of random paragraphs and chapters that are thrown together and make no sense. I did not even finish reading it since I couldn't make any sense of it. I don't recomend this book. 
 I'm happy for people who can write books. Good for Miss Gardner.  I had to skip page after page after page of this book, too boring. I think publishers should get a grip and spend more time reading what they publish. If they did, maybe disasters like this wouldn't happen so often.   
 I love Nigella's TV show, but was very disappointed in this book.  The format is downright confusing and the recipe directions poor.  The recipe for Barbados Cream says to mix all ingredients, but she doesn't really mean for you to mix in the brown sugar.  Recipes tell you to "beat til fairly stiff but not too stiff" (whatever that means) with no time recommendations.  She talks about simple, unpretentious food but includes some very odd ingredients and complicated directions.  There seems to be more effort put into the glib tone of the writing than into the food 
 What do you get when you mix global warming, an artificial intelligence named Gea (instead of Gaia), German idealist Friedrich Schelling, Catholic mystic Teilhard de Chardin, Russian Orthodox mystic philosopher Nikolai Federov, and a guilt-ridden far-future post-human networked mind in need of atonement?  Apparently, you get reams of turgid telling-not-showing exposition followed by soporific sermons about how humans can transcend themselves to become gods (or, as in the case of the net-mind Transcendence, a sort of Godnet 2.0).    Perhaps the soul of this book is the Catholic Priest character, Rosa (of course the Vatican has lightened up on that male Priest thing), who tells us Federov drew on "Marxist historical determinism, socialist utopianism, and deeper wells of Slavic theology and nationalism to come up with a 'Cosmism,' which preached an ultimate unity between man and the universe."  As you can see, Rosa has the soul of a GRE question writer on a bender at the Burning Man festival.  I love a rip-roaring space opera.  I also love mind-bending far-future speculation.  Unfortunately, this book is neither rip-roaring nor mind-bending.  Take a pass 
 Sorry this one is NOT a good one. Hailey North is purely a hit or miss author. The last two books I've read of hers have been awful though. I don't think I'll waste any more money on her books. There was another reviewer who expressed my sentiments exactly about the "hero", Alistair. Who wants a seventies hippie type hero??? Birkenstocks??? Please! - Yuck! Gray hair? No...sorry...uh uh...not doing anything for me. And Lauren, the "heroine", seemed really, really immature. Not to mention airheaded, fickle, frigid, naive, and God knows what all else (but none of it very good). Did I mention immature? So, basically, heroine has nothing going for her but looks, and hero has nothing going for him but money...where does this leave us? Going to bed early, which is NOT a sign of a good book. Spend your money on another author 
 Pipes' utter and complete disprespect of the russian people in general and communists in particular oozes out of every paragraph of this book. According to him, nothing, absolutely nothing good ever came out of the soviet union. Every action taken by the communist party was a complete failure. Communism turned the entire russian people into alcoholic slackers incapable of accomplishing anything. I can see exactly where President Reagan got his russophobia from. Don't waste your time with this book. To quote the Sting song, "...the russians love their children, too." But you wouldn't know it from this book 
 I have taken several courses on public relations in school. Most of what Michael Levine teaches is totally opposite of what several of my professors have taught me.  In all fairness to Levine, perhaps the practices described in his book were sufficient way back when the book was written, but the world has changed quite a bit since then, and the pace of Public Relations has changed along with it. I understand he wrote a follow-up book called Guerrilla PR Wired which pertains to using the internet as a valuable PR tool, but I know that using his outdated techniques, even with the help of the internet, would still not be the least bit helpful. I certainly would not recommend this book to other students who are preparing for a career in the field of PR 
 After reading four books on knife fighting, I'm beginning to realize there's not much more to be said, especially when Richard Ryan is saying it. "Pathetic" he calls man. A "walking sack of meat." No built-in mechanisms for defense, obviously not a predator by nature. Man had to "claw his way up" the foodchain.  Is this guy for real?  If you begin with a false premise, you can only get better and there are some relevant material in the book--if you can get past Ryan's flaming ego, which doesn't take long to become a smoldering ember.  But with all the useful information which, by the way, you can get elsewhere in far more entertaining ways, Ryan rapidly becomes tedious to read. The truth is, man has always been the most dangerous creature roaming this planet. Even cave deptictions show groups of armed men taking down creatures much larger and faster than themselves. And did anyone notice that most of early man wore fur and leather footwear.  It wasn't only weapons that made man dangerous, it was his resourcefulness and, did anyone say fire? Given to mortal man by the immortal Prometheus, it made man almost as powerful as the gods. Soon Greeks were putting sticks into the ground and mathematically figuring out the circumference of the globe. Then Persians, Greeks and Romans were making war using horses and elephants, and bronze and leather weapons, marching in formation and boldly claiming dominance over the land. Pathetic? "Walking sacks of meat?" Oh, and let's not forget in God's image.  The bottom line in knife fighting is, if someone wants to kill you with a knife, he probably will if he's smart enough and committed enough. Very few people are "called out" for knife fighting -- dirks have always been an assasin's tool, nearly everyone's last choice for going at it in the so-called "circle of death" in a fair fight.  When you can see the bad guy coming. When you see the predator's gleam in his eyes, then a knife can come in very handy. Tick someone off in a bar and a blade's likely to end up in your ribs before you can try all that macho knife stuff you learned.  A fellow I once knew pulled out a giant fold-out knife and laid it on the table so I could get a good look at it. Then he told me about two guys who were following him one night in a bad section of D.C. He turned and faced them, pulling out the knife and letting them see its glittering blade before he palmed it.  "Yeah, well what would you have done if they'd pulled out knives of their own and come after you?" He shrugged and replied, "I would have shot them."    
 EVERYONE HERE DON'T THINK OF BUYING THAT CRAP IT'S JUST A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME ,PEOPLE WHO GO ON THIS DIET SUFFER FOR LIFE TIME ,I TRIED IT AND I WAS SUFFERING FROM A DISORDER WITH MY EATING HABITS AND I HAVE VISITED LOTS OF DOCTORS TO CURE MY ILLNESS I BECAME SELF OBSESSED AND AND NEVER KNEW ITS RIGHT FOR ME TO EAT OR NOT ....PLEASE DONT TRY THIS BOOK AT ALL RISKS ITS NOT GOOD FOR ANYONE OF ANY AGE ,JUST BE ON A STABLE DIET AND WELL BALANCED MEALS AND U WILL LOSE WEIGHT ,OR TRY SOMETHING LIKE LOW-FAT DIET OR A PROTEIN DIET EVEN WOULD DO 
 ....boring and Woody Allen will drive you insane. He never stops talking!!! 
 Boy this movie was weird and psycho. I happen to like the weird movies but it was WAY off the psycho side for me. Friends try to cover up an "accidental death" from one of their friends when they try to pull a prank that goes horribly wrong. Things like this, I try to stay away from. Although I am glad I saw it so I won't always wonder if this movie was actually watchable or not. Now I know. I gave it 2 stars because the movie DID have it's charms. 
 I cannot believe all the positive reviews of this book. This is one of the dumbest, most painfully will-it-ever-end stories I have read.  This book is chock full of predictable plot points, boring characters and ridiculous dialogue.  Here's an example -- delivered by a mid-60's Vatican monsignor, hilariously named "Vigor...."  "This ancient society of mages must have known the location of Alexander's tomb after Septimus Severus hid it in the third century. They left it undisturbed, letting it safeguard the most valuable scrolls from the lost library. Then perhaps the quake in 1303 not only brought down the lighthouse, but exposed the tomb. They took the opportunity to hide more down there, using the chaotic time after the earthquake to plant their next clue, bury it, and allow the centuries to cover it up again."  Here's the punchline. "Vigor" delivers this soliloquy under water USING SCUBA GEAR!  I would be remiss if I did not also mention the grammatical errors which are too numerous to count. Is this bad writing or just bad editing?  The biggest dummy here, I must confess, is ME -- for buying this book on the recommendations of many who compare James Rollins with Dan Brown and declare James Rollins the better writer. (And on top of that I paid 20 bucks for this thing so that I could read it in eBook form.) Well, my friends, Dan Brown may not be a scholar, but at least he is entertaining and creates interesting characters and semi-plausible situations. The same can't be said for Jimmy Rollins. Dan Brown he ain't.  Map of Bones? Bag of Rocks says I 
 In this novel set in the Philippines in the 1970s we first meet Zamora, a wealthy Spanish landowner, as he helicopters to a remote area and discovers a small band of people who are still living the stone age.  His study of this group of people seem to be his hobby and his passion.     We also meet a young girl who is a servant in his home as well as his troubled German wife who soon grows weary of her unhappy life.  There's some political intrigue and some interesting characters and the story had a good chance of holding my interest.  Alas, though, the author left too many connecting details out to give it a coherent narrative flow and although I continued reading, the plot never quite hung together.  When I finished the book I still wasn't sure what it was about although it raised the questions that perhaps there wasn't a stone age tribe at all, but just a plot on the part of the corrupt government to give Zamora access to areas which would be politically advantageous to the dictator.  If this doesn't make sense to you, it doesn't make sense to me either.    Add to this a Hollywood film crew that has come into the town to make a movie about the Vietnam War.  This section of the book was probably based on the filming of "Apocalypse Now"  This part seemed to flow along well until it, too, lapsed into postmodernism and left more unanswered questions.  There were some parts of the book that were extremely well done. One was the voice of the servant girl character.  However, this one character was not enough to save this book from being hard to follow. On the whole, in spite of some good descriptions of the locale, Dream Jungle was too disjointed for me to recommend. 
 I tend to really enjoy books on culinary history; unfortunately this one left me wanting more.  The chapters are disjointed, with no true unifying theme.  The prose is stilted, though I suspect alot of this is due to poor translation.  The information itself is good, but badly presented; overall a boring mess of a book.  Pick up Tannahill's "Food in History" instead 
 This book started out well, although the disfigured model theme has been done already, and done much better by other authors.  The thing that killed this book for me was the overuse of the word "egregious" which became such a nuisance to me that I couldn't finish the book.  The author uses the word in places where it shouldn't be used, as if she doesn't know the meaning of it but liked the sound.  Teenagers who wouldn't have this kind of vocabulary use this word constantly in this book.  I'm also displeased by her depiction of both women and men as sexual objects and nothing else.  All in all, disappointing 
 If you are like me you like a book that really gets you into it no matter where you are in the book. In other words if you are interested in the material at lesson nine that is where you start. Well this book doesn't even come close to doing that. I am an advanced computer user and pick up things easily. This book forces you to creep your way slowly through the lessons. Forget about looking up how to do a specific task. You may find this book usefull if you are an absolute beginner to the computer software interface. Otherwise I suggest you get something a little more advanced 
 this is not avant-garde or experimental or anything of value. believe him when he calls it hardcore. this kind of [...] only happens in america. richard kern takes advantage of the fact that americans, in their schizo frenzy, will mistake this for some kind of offensive euro trash art, meanwhile exploiting your daughters at just the right moment. it is all the more offensive that he considers himself an artist. this is not what experimental film or any other kind of film is all about. the only reason to watch these films is to get off. richard kern is what's wrong with new york. if you like larry clark, well i don't want to encourage you because you are sick and evil and altogether tasteless, but you will like this 
 I usually like James Patterson but this book was absolutely horrible. Not only was it hard to follow, but I never ended up caring about any of the characters. I can't believe he was able to get this published AND win an award. I guess I just don't get it 
 I just purchased the Toshiba HD-A2 HD-DVD player and I love it.  I was unpleasantly surprised when the HD side of the disc would not play on my machine.  I had already registered my player and was told my Toshiba to upgrade my firmware.  I received the firmware disc today, installed it and the disc still won't work.  The Standard DVD side works fine, but what's the point.  So I'm sending the disc back to Amazon.  Beware of these hybrid discs! Many other HD-DVD owners have had similar problems.  Happy Feet, Army of Darkness, and other hybrid discs to name a few, may not play on your Toshiba, even with the firmware update.  Recently, Universal decided to kill hybrid discs altogether for future releases and are reissuing current releases as HD-only.  I'm 99% sure this was done because of playback problems like mine.  Bravo to Universal for nipping this in the bud right away.  Besides, if I wanted to buy the standard DVD, I would have.  But I want my HD! So when Children of Men is reissued, I will buy it again.  Until then I will stay away from the Hybrid Combo DVD's until they are all discontinued and re-issued.  By the way, Children of Men was awesome in the theater...it's killing me that I can't watch it in HD yet.. 
 Ok, I don't mean to be rude, but if you think this is great writing you are woefully uneducated. It is almost a sad confirmation of the common stereotype of fundamentalist Christians being uneducated yokels that so many of them think this is great writing. Here's my take: I'd enjoy a good "end of times" story - this just isn't it. The Left Behind series is amateurish and poorly written and just plain astonishing to me that it has had such huge success. P.T. Barnum once said that no one ever went broke understimating the intelligence of the American public and this series proves it. Christians should demand better writing from their revered authors. Go read some C.S. Lewis or something - please. 
 Books like this show the clear difference between those authors who have a positive idea to share with the world with the experience to back it up, and  those who are merely fullfilling their own juvenile fantasy.  The author here clearly had no other agenda than to "stick it" to Oreilly out of whatever "how dare Oreilly disagree with me" justification that was conveniently available at the time.  The attacks are all predictibly by the numbers and standard issue "I hate oreilly" slams that one could find on any number of websites (for free).  In fact anyone who frequents the usual websites will find everything in here to be extremely old news, with the same information one could gleen from even a superficial examination of the internet, very shallow.  The author seems more interested in engaging in cackling self-congratulation about how (not so) witty he himself is, than doing anything that hasnt been done (better) before.  But the book is clearly aimed at the choir, those people who dont watch Oreilly anyway and only know what people like the author tell them, having no interest in learning anything more superficial than "Oreilly sucks!" and thinking themselves are hilarious and clever for saying it.  If you hate Oreilly, buy it, the author is hoping you do. If you are neutral or even, *gasp*, PRO Oreilly, dont buy it.  You have heard it all before from other people less obsessed with the sound of their own voice 
 I was not happy with this purchase.  This video only taught 10 min. of teaching followed by 30 min of a porn flick at the end.  The teaching was informative balanced with different women with various shapes and builds, I could have used more teaching and less of a porn show.  This was a waste of money!  There are a few more reviews like mine so take our advise. 
 Irvine Welsh has been a lot of things to a lot of different people- some say he's the best thing to happen to British writing in a decade, some say he's just a flash-in-the-pan with uncouth sensibilities who writes thoughtless, violent stories about amoral scumbags. Say what you will about Welsh as a writer- be it that he's talented, sick, brilliant, strange or just plain nuts- but he is, and has never been, boring. Until now. "Marabou Stork Nightmares" is a colossal letdown after the one-two punch of "Trainspotting" and "The Acid House", a jumbled, convoluted tale about a repugnant [man] trawling his last moments away in a life that most closely resembles a bedridden hell. This is not the first first-person account of a psychopath that Welsh has written- see later, his aptly-titled "Filth"- but even at his worst, D.S. Bruce Robertson had a sort of perverse wit to him, while this story lacks anything short of coherence, wit, humor or even plot.  The protagonist of this brutish tale is Roy Strang, a bedridden criminal pissing the last moments of his sad life away in a bed, ready to die. As he slowly slips in and out of consciousness, Roy reflects on the family upbringing- that entailed rape, sexual molestation and the vicious abuse of his right-wing Uncle- that led him to this state. We see later in his life, as Roy attempts to straighten himself out, get a job and "choose life", as it were, but we continue to see that he cannot escape the sins of his past. All the while, he hunts the formidable African Predator the Marabou Stork- a personification of all the misery, evil, hatred, pain and badness in Roy himself- on a wild Safari in Africa, that ostensibly all takes place in Roy's morphine-and-depravity-addled brain.  The novel proves that Welsh can still pull plenty of tricks out of his proverbial hat when it comes to language- some of his bawdy, boy's-night-out Scottish dialogue still provokes a chuckle or two, while the disgusting gangrape scene towards the book's denouement is one of the more haunting I have read in recent memory. And yet, for all its mild pleasures, this book still sees Welsh falling majorly short of the mark, sinking into the endless mire of Roy Strang's egomaniacal fever dream. Consider this one a real "Nightmare" 
 I was so totally disappointed with the recipes included in the book. I have to admit that I tried only 3 but each did not go over with me or the rest of my family. I decided to quit while I was ahead. Other information included in the book is excellent but do not get this book for the recipes alone 
 This is not a "typical" Fuller effort. He goes for the Cinemascope view of post War Japan, pictures of blossoms and Mt Fuji and is lumbered with that sorry excuse for a performer, Robert Stack with his mannered wanderings - whether in a hurry or standing still he seems to be strolling along -  and his full range of expressions from A to B.  The drama gets to be placed secondary to the scenery and the suspense likewise droops much as I imagined Ms Yamaguchi's desire drooped at the thought of giving Mr Stack a massage.  Boy what a let down. Mr Ryan does his professional best but hey, he's always a trooper worth watching.  Mr Godard allegedly thought this was Fuller's best film - if so he must have been high on some illegal substance at the time. No no Nannette?  No no noir 
 The author's message, in essence, is that working mothers are not "real" mothers. I can only assume that in the sequel to this sexist, essentialist rant, she will reveal how working fathers are not "real" fathers, and how they should build *their* careers around parenthood, and how they are sadly mistaken to think they could possibly be successful both in the labor force and at home. 
 I rely on customer reviews when deciding on a book. Apparently the three reviews I read that appeared to be helpful turned out to be a  disappointment. This book is obviously written for someone with a very  extensive vocabulary. It is filled with $10.00 words and ideas that are  really hard to decipher. I was under the impression, via the other 3  reviews, that this book would provide an explanation of  "mindblindness" in terms the average layman could understand.   After reading the  first two chapters, I had to go back and read them again  and again. I suggest you try to find this one at the public library before  you decide to permenantly add it to you own personal collection. Save your  money and the shipping charges 
 This CD has one objective - push a leftist agenda. It's themes are awash in "class struggles" and pushes everything from the perspective of the persecuted poor. It even has a short piece on considering the food's point of view when eating meat. This is the worst sort of leftist propaganda trash, and we do our children no favors by bashing everything and everyone that might not be one of the downtrodden.. 
 Like others while I was looking forward to hearing more music I was ticked that there are only 2 songs on the CD!!! Amazon should make more clear.  Reasonable people would expect more than 2 Songs on a CD.  Regards, Ripped Off 
 I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I.  Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship.  And the writing isn't so hot, either.  If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad.  The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort 
      Three kids whose parents have abandoned them are put at a place called Whitegates.  They escape and go down river to the worst place you could ever imagine.  This is where they meet the grateful Heaven Eye's.  They also met heaven Eye's grandpa who is a little weird and scary. The scariest things happen in the Black Middens.  They have to try and find out the mystery of the Black Middens, Heaven Eye's, and grandpa      The dislikes I had about the book was every time someone had said something David would write he said, she said.  He would never replace said with yelled or screamed or anything.  I didn't really like the end of the book that much.  I thought the book was a little pointless.  The ending didn't really have a reason behind it.      I would recommend this book to people who are into books about people getting stuck somewhere.  Also I would recommend this book to people who look at the positives in life.  
 This movie is not at all for a hard core horror movie fan.There was was way too much waiting around for something to happen butnothin ever did... 
 Here, Shanks has very thoroughly designed nothing more than another self-indulgent attack on Christianity and Intelligent Design. Evolutionary theorists should be as appalled by his emotional and often childish idioms throughout as the ID defenders for whom he shows no respect. I have studied at length the arguments of creation science and watched as theoretical holes and the widening gap between opponents fills with bickering. While I will not make specific recommendations, I will suggest you seek out the few calm objective critiques that are available.  
 These apples are coated in sugar and other gunk (like sunflower oil) which gives them a strange taste. I was very disappointed when I tried them. I was wanting nice dried apples that taste like apples instead of oil, sugar and preservatives. Now I'm stuck with two bags of a product that is not very good. I also got stuck with the dried strawberries which are even worse. I will not be trying any more Stoneridge Orchard products. BE AWARE!!, these products cannot be returned to Amazon so be sure before you order 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 This book combination is just a physical copy of the "help" available on the respective programs.  It does include lessons to accompany the information.  These lessons are very similar to the tutorials that came with the program.  The book would be helpful to any individual purchasing these programs to do primarily digital photo editing.  If, however, you are interested in using Premiere Elements and Photoshop Elements to prepare custom graphics and menus, this book is not a great resource.  The software is great; the book written for the software is not so great 
 The others in the series were great, and I really looked forward to A Breath of Snow and Ashes. It read like it was all Gabaldon's discarded notes for the previous installment.  I felt really cheated to have spent my time and money on this book.  
 Good scripts but the lead actress, whos been really great in other roles, isnt suited for this role. Her supporting cast isnt strong either 
 I was really excited to receive this book... however, I've had a difficult time enjoying reading it.  The run-on sentences, poor grammer, and loose sentence structure are so distracting, that as a reader, you loose interest.  I spent more time editing in my mind, then pulling together what the author was saying.  Rather long-winded, I kept having the feeling of "let's get to the point."  On a positive note, there are some fun pictures and the author does string together some interesting concepts.  Personally, I just couldn't get past the writing.  Summary - although interesting, don't expect concise writing 
 An unreadable book.  Bits and pieces stretched out over 800 pages that never add up to a whole.  To use DeLillo's garbage theme: it was like finding litter on a sidewalk.  Each piece once meant something, but who knows what.    I finished it because I had read so many good reviews that I thought there must be something worthy in it.  Sometimes a book is torture and then everything comes together at the end.  Not in this case.  Torture for 800 pages and then poof! DeLillo tidies everything up in an epilogue.  Nice scenes and nice sentences and BIG ideas don't necessarily make a book a worthwhile read. It was my first DeLillo book and it will probably be my last 
 This was a book that i was required to read for my english lit class.  Although i didn't personally like the book, many people that i know did.  I found the subject matter very boring, partly because of my inability to relate to it.  I would only recommend this book to someone with a strong interest in South African politics 
 Same comments on the latch opening easily.   My complaint about the belt clip - it is made of inexpensive plastic and broke off after two days mild use. Wouldn't buy again 
 I am writing as an experienced SWAT operator, firearms instructor, and competitive 3-Gun Match shooter.  This book is great for beginning rifle shooters or members of the Jeff Cooper Fan Club.  However, there is nothing explained or taught in this book that I did not also receive in my very first basic rifle school.  As with most of Mr. Cooper's writing, the text tends to become "preachy" and critical of modern society and technology.  While I usually agree with most of what Mr. Cooper has to say and write, I am not one of his many acolytes.  More to the point, I sincerely wish he would stop writing as if he assumes that the reader is a member of his fan club.  The book was a disappointment. I felt that it was mostly a collection of large photos, stories, Mr. Cooper's opinions on a lot of non-shooting subjects, and a few shooting tips.  Each of the sections could have been expanded a great deal.  At least he didn't push the Scout Rifle concept too hard in this book.  I respect Mr. Cooper and his accomplishments but his claim that "riflecraft is an art that has been completely ignored since WWII" is simply untrue.  There are better books available on this subject 
 The Winter Prince was amazing. I found myself frustrated with Medraut when he became arrogant and prideful. He refused to ask his father, Artos, for help in battling his evil mother, Morgause. I felt helpless because I could not offer Medraut support. Luckily Medraut begins to change as Lleu begins to trust him. I love the ending where....well I won't tell you that. This  book is really great! It kept me on the edge of seat. The historical attributes help me understand ancient history that had been confusing previously 
 Go elsewhere for a balanced scholarly account, this book is just an attempt to cash in on a false politically-correct warping of history.  Not much good for anything 
 A how-to book for reading the future is a product that has had universal appeal for people.  Since ancient times, people have sought to use various methods to gain an advantage, to know what others are thinking and what the future will hold.  Unfortunately, there is no such thing as psychic abilities, and all the wishing and hoping in the world, and all the how-to books that one reads will not change that.  Once people thought they could tell the future by reading the entrails of animals, and by judging how birds were flying.  Now there are a whole new set of fantasies.  One thing, though - at least this one doesn't claim to be speaking to the dead relatives of her fans 
 It takes too much time to receive the first book. I haven't received the first book yet 
 This publication features vague descriptions of photo concepts that makes it useless for reference.  Possibly good for beginners, but if you are even an amateur photographer, you need a book that describes more in depth about filters, push processing, lenses, and chemicals. I was slightly disappointed and am still looking for a good reference book. For now, I am just googling concepts that I am  trying to research. Works better than this book 
 This book is a very descriptive book on anatomy and the author covers the human body in great detail and provides many examples and good illustrations. Here's why I only gave it 2 stars.  This book is NOT an easy read by any means. It is truly college level reading material. I am a student majoring in Nursing and I have to tell you that the author does not do an adequate job of simplifying the material, which gets VERY complex in later chapters. Frequently throughout the text when describing something, say an organ, he will give you every last ounce of info on that organ but truly fail to tell you the BASIC FUNCTION that it performs. He uses a page of text when a paragraph will do. I frequenlty had to have a dictionary by my side reading this. Many of my classmates shared the same opinion.  He  does not "Dumb it down" so to speak for an average person who is reading this. Frederick Martini's version of Anatomy is much better. He really simplifies the complex concepts and his way of writing is much more decipherable and READER FRIENDLY  than Saladin's. Many college students I know have struggled  mightily reading through Saladin's technical writing and wish they had a  simpler book to read. I probably would have done much better in my anatomy classes had they issued us a better textbook than this complex, indecipherable encyclopedia 
 First let me say this was my first exposure to Jodi Picoult, so maybe her authorship of many novels may imply talent, I can't comment beyond this book. That said, this was one of the few "novels" I was always reluctant to resume and ultimately abandoned halfway through. In addition to another reviewer's comments on shifting POV (for what reason?, I couldn't come to terms with it), unrealistic characters, and soap-opera-type scenes, it was jarring to come across a lack of basic writing skills in some passages. "Pop lit" came to mind immediately, and while I tried to finish this book loaned by a friend, I found it an irritating endeavor. Despite some popularity, I'm not likely to pick up another Picoult book 
 The book started out really well, but then became very self-congratulatory.  The author includes about 40 photographs of herself in an array of different outfits.  While I admire her success, a bit less self-adulation would have made this a far better read.  
 Rob touches on so much with this CD.  My favorite song is one that hasn't got any airplay and, in my opinion, the public missed out a great hit!  "Streetcorner Symphony" is about people coming together. It's what I call my happy song.  Each day as I go to work I play the song as loud as I can get it!  We, my daughters and I, saw him live and he also called it a happy song!  I can't wait for his live albulm to come out! There are fast and slow songs on this CD and will be worth EVERY PENNY you spend to buy it! Incredible voice and songwritting 
 It's been enduring pain when I tested the code examples and it did'nt work on JBoss. The content looks a bit old and needs an update 
 A picture showing James Dean and Elia Kazan visiting the East of Eden set claims they're doing so in 1955 when they were probably actually visiting it in 1954 (the year they actually made EOE). I never thought of Kazan as being one of the greatest directors ever and I still don't. He's certainly no Alfred Hitchcock or Cecil B. deMille or Steven Spielberg. 
 Another "white man bad" screed.  What should have been a fascinating story ends up being a platform for the author's own bigotry.  Skip it 
 I bought this to add to my growing collection of etiquette books, but it's less a book of etiquette advice (no real guidelines) and more a book of brief, isolated observations about what kind of person aspiring ladies would like to be ("A lady always knows when to X," "A lady will know how to Y").   Forgive me for pointing out that someone purchasing this book probably already has a fair idea of these kinds of things. That's why they are trying to learn how to become a lady.  The text is sparse, very large and highly stylized with wide margins. It's cute for a coffee table, a gift basket, or other decorating purposes, but if you're looking for an etiquette guide to know HOW to become more lady-like, this book is not for you.  For a catch all reference work, invest in a relatively up to date version of Emily Post's, Amy Vanderbilt's, or Laeticia Baldridge's etiquette books, the first being my favorite. If you'd like something more anecdote/situation driven, try the Miss Manners books by Judith Martin 
 If you are looking for a book that does a cover to cover job of bashing western civilization with complete and obvious bias, this is it. 
 I've always loved the original trilogy, but these prequals are just awful. This episode 3 was probably the most dissapointing. I had hoped that maybe lucas could salvage this horrible trilogy but he just made it worse. Horrible acting and writing really sent this movie down the toilet. The only slightly decent thing in the movie was the lightsaber scene between anakin and obi wan. 
 Set Abominae wrote a very good review about this trash, but its time I put in my two cents. I loathe Jay-Z and Linkin Park ALOT, but putting them together is horrifying beyond belief!!  Like what Set Abominae said, this is nothing more than Jay-Z croonimg about his bling, thugz, hoez, and moneyz with a bunch of nerdy white kids screaming out Korn and Limp Bizkit b-sides with some irritating techno going with it.  Only nerds who adore Trigun (one of the worst anime titles of all time) and play DDR all the time will like this.  I'd keep going but I think I've made 400+ Trigun/DDR fans cry and wet their pants. 
 To prove America is a Christian nation David Barton cites the little known blasphemy conviction of Abner Kneeland. During the 1830s Kneeland,a former Universalist turned pantheist, was sentenced to sixty days in a Boston jail for ridiculing the deity of Christ. Barton cites Commonwealth v. Abner Kneeland as example of how early American jurisprudence defended Christianity.   Either David Barton is a sloppy scholar or he is a man with a scary agenda. Does Barton believe that state governments should have the power to jail people for stating religious opinions contrary to his? Why else would he cite the Kneeland case?   Kneeland should only be a curious anachronism, not a legal precedent.   
 This worked fine at first but after a few months, the charger could not hold the AAA batteries in place. The spring mechanisms failed for 3 out of the 4 positions that would hold the AAA batteries. Thus, I could no longer charge the AAA batteries. Then after a while, the charger just quit working all together 
 I tried inventing a character by answering the questions in this book, but got overwhelmed by the dozens (hundreds?) of questions. I wonder whether it's necessary to compile so much information to create a character. I would guess that a few key traits as well as some information about profession, appearance, and backstory are probably what's needed. I sensed Mr. Lukeman's concern and intelligence throughout, but I notice that he's an agent, not a fiction writer. Is it possible that he's mistaken about how writers really create characters 
 Even if you're a "conservative," you gotta admit that this is one of the worst magazines around. If you like good writing, don't even try this one. A "one star" is still too generous in my opinion. 
 I was pretty pumped to get the DVD collection of my beloved White Sox World Series run. I was dismayed to find out that the collection would not include all post season games. One of the games not included is a fairly memorable game Game 2 of the ALCS vs the Angels that had the much discussed incident with A.J. Pierzynski.  Putting aside the missing games I horrified when I put the first disk in. Contrary to what I have read in other reviews, this is NOT an anamorphic widescreen transfer. The games were broadcast in 16:9 high definition so I cannot understand why the DVDs were not transfered this way. The DVDs are presented in a 4:3 letterboxed format. I found the games difficult to watch like this. If you don't have a high definition television then maybe this will not be an issue, but if you DO have a HD set (the only way to watch sports in my opinion) you will be disappointed 
 Shooting People is a small thesis on how America exported reality TV to Europe and gave them bad habits. It blames the US for everything.  The last time I checked, we never forced Europe to watch television 
 I'm not sure why the description says "easy to remove" clothes, because I had to cut everything except the dolls out.  Maybe they meant easy to remove from the dolls, or maybe I just got a bad lot!  But I had no idea I was going to have to cut everything out in order to use it!  My hand is hurting!  It's a cute set but also a little flimsy (while punching out the dolls a couple of them tore on the tabs) 
 My roommate gave me this book and I thought it would be a good read during the winter break (I am a college student).  Halfway through chapter 2 (pg 18) I decided to stop reading the book. The book can be summarized by saying that we human make decisions based on feeling and not logic. This book explains why is that. But it doesn't teach you how to become more logical 
 I already knew that Michael Savage was a draft dodger since I always check the New Hampshire Chickenhawk Database. From some reason they do not have his birthday. According to the official "Name Authority" from the Library of Congress database, his real name is Michael A. Weiner and he was born March 31, 1942. But why is he a hypocrit regarding American soldiers like me?  Dr. Weiner/Savage does the usual butter-me-up, like on page 104. He talks about former Hollywood actors who served in WWII, "True American heroes yes...They, unlike the empty suits of today, fought shoulder-to-shoulder alongside America's finest young boys. The farmers, the steelworkers, the taxi drivers. The people who made this country great." The only problem here is that he is describing MY family and not his.  His image of former soldiers is extremely negative and very offensive to me. In describing a veteran expressing his true feelings about war "war is awful..he never wanted to fight, he didn't believe in fighting although he wore the uniform [what do you mean Weiner?] and yes he was a hero and has many medals even though he naver actually fought." This isn't even the pot calling the kettle black. "Their anti-war comments both undermine our troops' morale and encourage our enemies by creating a picture of a divided front." Weiner also states, "[t]he ill-informed comments of these camera-craving, ex-military types in the attempt to prop-up a sagging self-esteem, do extensive damage to the war on terror and our military." Keep that second comment in mind, but who is the guy with the self-esteem problem? He doesn't have any "fake" medals so who is he to criticize a person who actually served?  If anybody is harming our troops it is Weiner/Savage. On page 88 he actually tells us it is okay for al-Qaida to kill our soldiers. Really. "If you were a leader or an intellectual in the Muslim world and you saw the debauchery promulgated by the West...and saw your young people gravitating toward the filth pumped over your airwaves, what would you do? Frankly you would support al-Qaida or any organization [like al-Qaida in Iraq or the Taliban in Afghanistan?] that would want to stop that flood of pollution from entering your country." Thanks for clearing up why it is okay for these guys to kill our soldiers. And here I thought they just hated our freedoms.   There are other problems with this book. On page 108 he decries the "intense use of drugs." Yeah, like Limbaugh's abuse of Oxycontin that he forgot to mention. Most diturbing to me is his use of words such as "sheeple," which is word coined by racist Aryan Nations members. Why he would use a favorite word of anti-Semites, seeing as how Weiner/Savage is a Jew, as well as a word used extensively by Timothy McVey is quite strange. He also uses dismissive language like "leg-crossers," (page 85)which I assume is a substitute for "bitch." And, finally, for all of you steelworkers, taxi drivers, etc., who are his fans: this guy thinks you're dumb. All you need to do is read page 106 to see what he thinks about opinions of non-college graduates.  As one last snipe on this guy, I just love that photo of him (all photos are of him) in the book, under the line "my ship has come in." That is one big yacht he is at the helm of. To his question of where to steer his yacht, how about towards the Gulf and to join the fight? I did ny combat, now you do yours. 
 Note: If I could give this 0 stars, I would  I picked up this book on the strength of the high recommendations listed here - I guess I should have looked at the fact that there were only (5) reviews.  This book was trite, un-even, and just plain ridiculous.  It started out with a decent enough premise but did nothing to really build the relationship between the hero and heroine.  Maggie came off as a young, naive, totally unrealistic, "I'm trying to be cute & pert" but, I'm not.  It's almost as if the character "Ally McBeal" were thrust into a book.  The plot veered off in directions that didn't get tied up and the Hero, Connor, seemed to be spouting lines because that's what he was supposed to say rather than what he felt.    Also, there wasn't too much of anything that was daring in this book.  Just Ugghhh!  I feel sad that I dared to buy this.  Just run the other way - get something by Gaelen Foley (The Duke) or Lisa Kleypas (Dreaming of You) instea 
 Slow,dull and done on the "cheap"....stick with "Zulu" and read your history book's ....far more entertaining 
 It would at least meant that I cared one way or another what was happening when reading it 
 book was written in 95. i read it in 2005. half of this is on computers in 95. 1/4 of this is good 
 First I will start with the obvious...Rebecca Walker is without a doubt a very gifted writer...the way she puts words and phrases together...in some ways is almost melodic. I was not disappointed with how this memoir was crafted...it is the content that disappointed me.  I am 34 years old and 28 weeks pregnant.  I have felt a lifetime of ambivalence about having children.  I thought this book was going to explore the pathways between that ambivalence and the decision to embrace motherhood.  Yet Rebecca stated that she always wanted to have a baby....you see her struggle with finding the right opportunity for getting pregnant but never with the desire to be pregnant.  I kept on feeling that in that sense the subtitle was somewhat misleading.  I have read the reviews on this board and other reviews as well and no one seems to be willing to truely "critique" this book.  Is it because she is who she is?  I don't feel that reviewers have been truely honest about the merits of this book.  Not to mention the fact that so few women will be able to relate to this writer and her experience.  
 Got the toaster oven instead of the convection oven twice.. 
 Stephen King is a master of suspense, but for whatever reason he decided to leave his trademark out of this apocalyptic 'masterpiece.'  I'm not sure what all the hype is about with this novel. I found it much too long and anti-climactic. The character development is extensive and wonderful, but if I had to read about one more commitee meeting I was going to throw the book out the door. Near the book's end I was ready for them all to die just so the story would stop.   The great parts of this book were much too few and far between to justify the length. In the end I understood why his editors cut it down. I had much more fun reading Salem's Lot 
 	My opinion of this book is that it would be better off in the hands of a nine year old.  In a way this book was a bit too juvenile for me.  The hardest word was "hernia".   	The story took place in Moon, Texas, where the roads hadn't been paved yet.  Grandpap becomes ill.  He moves with the Jaynell's family.  Gradpap buys an emerald greed Cadillac.  He teaches Jaynell how to drive.  Grandpap passes away.  They sell the Cadillac.  Not exactly my idea of an interesting book.  This book was very vague.  I couldn't even find the climax.  I would not recommend this book if there were others. 
 I was assigned this book for a teaching certification course and I have never seen a worse textbook in my life.  It's full of long lists of terms that are never explained.  The visuals are confusing.  It's incredibly wordy.  I think the same information could easily be condensed down to a short pamplett if they just took out all of the redundancy 
 I don't know why the pundits and apologists in the Star Trek book community (in which I deem myself a proud member) write glorious and positive reviews about every Star Trek book that comes out.  Can't someone in this community just honestly say what they really think, i.e. that a lot of Star Trek books nowadays are just plain crap?  I don't want to offend any writers (I envy your job), but I hope that the quality of Star Trek books that are published is indicative of lower reading ability and laziness on the part of the reading public, and not a matter of weak talent among writers.  I can say this with confidence about "Orion's Hounds" because I know that Bennett can write really well.  And just don't take my word for it, read "Ex Machina."  In any event, on to "Orion's Hounds."  This "Titan" series appeared promising.  After a good start with the first book, it was all downhill from there.  Isn't there anything else to write about except bringing back the "star jellies" from the first season of "The Next Generation" (TNG)?  I couldn't even finish this book, and after a month, I don't really care anymore.  The characters violate their own set of ethics (the Prime Directive) just so a group of space faring creatures won't be killed.  Are we now to justify interfering with every culture that hunts to sustain itself, or that even eats meat.  I don't think so, because that includes 24th century humans.  The writing is weak, characters act out of character, there's a mishmash of species that don't even exist in the Star Trek universe (I could tolerate this at first, but now it's getting annoying; part of the essence of Trek is the Trek universe's unique races; by making up more and more races that don't exist as part of the Trek universe waters down the essence of Trek), and the author obviously writes with a political agenda in mind, which is fine itself, but stop preaching.  It's not that I necessarily disagree with the author on some points, but I read Trek novels to escape and be entertained.    
 As a student of many books, I can safely say that this offered less information on the subject title of any book I have read. It has made me a little hesitant of new books unless I specifically know the author. Spend your money elsewhere 
 I looked forward to reading this book as the third part of Mr. Hensall's discussion of the Nazi and Japanese advanced weapons program.  The first two books had appeared to be well-researched, and somewhat ground-breaking their thesis that the Nazis were quite intent on placing NBC warheads on the V1 and V2.I guess I was wrong.  This book is a rather workman-like recital of site details from the first two books to which is appended rumor, conjecture, and leaps of faith about what took place in the respective nuclear programs.  Facts are twisted and rumors made truths.The most glaring example of this is when Mr. Hensall recants a position from "Vengance"; namely that there were Bazi missile silos near Cherbourg.  He now says that they were pre-war French designed bases for gun turrets.  He passes on his mistake with a disingenuous, well that's what they looked like to me comment.Overall, a waste of time and money 
 The premise of people with animal DNA I thought had potential for interesting differences and conflicts.  Having read and enjoyed other paranormal and "romantica" novels, the reviews had me looking forward to this one.  The main characters were attractive enough, and although the plot was fairly predictable the book's biggest disappointment was that the hot encounters between Callan and Merinus was so motivated by an overwhelming chemical dependency (via Callan's pheromones) that the sex was disturbingly and distractingly involuntary--like a drug addiction.  If this sounds like it would bother you, look elsewhere 
 I am an avid reader and probably go through a book a week. When I can upon the book it looked interesting and even though it was the second book in the series (the book store did not have the first) I went ahead and got it. It was a BIG disappointment!  Many of the ideas and concept the author uses come strange from Laurel K. Hamilton and Anne Bishop books. The whole book seemed to be a mixture of these two writes previously used ideas. The copying is so blatant I am really surprised that it even got published. If you're interested in reading a good book try the authors she copied off of. 
 We bought this for my son for Christmas, on the conditon that he never put fish in it, since the reviews said it killed fish.  That worked fine until he won a fish at the school carnival.  Of course it had to go in with the sharks.  So with freshly treated water and a prayer, we put the fish in.  The next day it was very listless and lying along the bottom.  After checking the reviews, I saw one where the person removed the fish and they recovered.  So we've taken the beta out and are waiting to see if it will survive.  I still would rate this aquarium 1 star for cool looks and lights, but it's very noisy and I believe it kills fish 
 As a field biologist involved in hummingbird studies in the SW, I can say that red--or any other color--dye is nonsense!  NOT needed, quite likely harmful.  Also, I question the instant nectar--instructions say it doesn't require boiling.  Is there a preservative in it that retards yeast and bacterial growth?  If so it would likely be extremely harmful to the gut of the hummers: it could harm their natural internal flora 
 There was no conspiracy. It pains me to say that, but it is true. The government is not capable of pulling it off, I promise.   Lee Oswald acted alone, we did land on the moon, there was no alien landing at Roswell NM, RFK was murdered by a lone nut as was MLK (maybe James Earl Ray's brother knew about it in advance), We are not in Iraq for Halliburton (they had more contracts under Bill Clinton), FDR did not know about Pearl Harbor....none of it makes sense. America seriously needs to move on and tackle more serious issues (like the fact that we are going bankrupt). Seriously, young people around the country hate the US because adults tell them that the CIA killed JFK and the President sends troops to war to make money for Halliburton (morons like Phil Donahue!!!)....please grow up...   As for this book...read all the conspiracy you want...Brennen SAW Lee Oswald DO it!!! Go to Dealey Plaza (I have been there several times), it is very small....from the spot Brennen was standing you could honestly tell if somebody in the 6th floor window was wearing braces, or had on a POLO brand Shirt, or had not shaved that morning. There is no way that Brennen would mis-identify a person from that close a distance. This is the same reason that a grassy knoll shooter is not feasable. Honeslty, A rifle, from 90 ft? I could have hit JFK with a baseball from the Grassy Knoll..and about 200 people would have seen me do it and I would not have moved 50 ft before I was tackled. Again...go there and look...the grassy knoll is about 25 ft from where Zabruder stood (from an elevated stance), all he had to do was turn his camera another inch or 2 and we would have a clear view of the area behind the picket fence. He did not do so because his attention was not drawn there...because there was nobody shooting there!!! Rifle Fire is LOUD, and unmistakable!!! God Damn Jack Ruby for causing this mess!!  
 I find this album trash for a few reasons but Foxy was the number 1 reason to me. I just hate female rappers. She was like what, 16 in this? I aint takin no young hooker serious. And since Nas is my favorite mc it hurts like hell to give this a low rating. The only listenable tracks to me is firm biz and phone tap. Canibus ripped them on they own track. All I gotta say is this. Dont cop this album. Cop Nas and AZ albums. The firm is for the birds 
 I believe that the author of this book should review it. I did not fine any searching in this book. The native people from the rain forest should be let in peace 
 I read this biography not just because I'm a big and longstanding fan of Bob Dylan, but also because of the strength of many of the accolades the book has received, both in Amazon and elsewhere. I couldn't have been more disappointed. The biography is clearly well-researched, despite Heylin's proud but unconvincing defence of the fact that he has never met Dylan. However, the biography lacks any warmth or feel for Dylan and the huge and deep contribution his music has made to modern culture. The book comes down with detail, but much of it is incidental and irrelevant. Moreover, Heylin manages to be condescending and irritatingly opinionated, especially and unnecessarily so about other biographers. His constant use of direct quotes merely breaks the flow of the text and rarely adds much. Normally, when one reads a biography of a musician and songwriter who has played such an important part in one's own life, and especially when the author admits to being fan, one would expect to be driven back to the music with renewed vigour and interest. In the case of Heylin's biography this didn't happen. I can still recall the huge impact that some of Dylan's albums had on my life, and music more generally, but this does not come across in Heylin's often flat and at times self-important writing style. While there is plenty of gossip around Dylan's fondness for women, drugs and drink, few original insights are offered about his music. Indeed, Dylan's music is hardly assessed at all, apart from occasional references to the views of other critics. Dylan's life and music deserve a lot more 
 First of all, let me qualify this review by stating up front that I have been a DM fan since its inception and think that the band has single-handedly influenced a whole generation of musicians. That being said, I think this album is a symptom of a much larger problem with the band: a real lack of vision and originality.  On the good side, many DM diehard fans will like the majority of the tracks because it reverts to familiar fodder - dark lyrics with machine-driven rhythms. On the bad side, it's all too familiar stuff with  beats that could have been lifted from earlier efforts. The only real difference is that the tracks on "Angel" sound like they've been fed through a fuzz-box.   The first time I listened to this disc, I thought I had blown-out the speakers because the drum tracks clipped and everything else sounded distorted and fuzzy. I soon realized this was intentional, but had to ask myself, why? "Exciter" was experimental, but a truly drained effort. This album sounds like a pale imitation of Bjork. They even copied the toy piano and music box stuff like on Bjork's "Vespertine" album. The difference between Bjork and DM is that Bjork knows how to use weird sounds to enhance a lyric and create a musical mood. This album just sounds like conventional mid 80's DM music that was fed through badly recorded effects.  I really could feel the creative slide with this band when "Ultra" was released, but this record confirms what I have sensed for some time. The band has really struggled to achieve artistic relevency since the departure of Alan Wilder. Martin Gore is a musical genius, but he has limitations when carrying 90% of the musical vision and writing. I really think Gore needs an intellectual foil to conterpoint and challenge his ideas. Unfortunately, this album sounds more like a Gore solo effort than a true DM product and as a result, the music has greatly suffered. Gone are the famously catchy hooks and relevant, edgy lyrics. Here comes the gloomy ballads with headcase-jilted-lover lyrics (yawn). A new member or creative colaborator in the band would inject some fresh ideas into their music or I fear this may be their last record.  Word of advise: although this album does show some promise at times, your best friend here is iTunes. Download "Precious" and preview the rest of the record before making any additional choices. You may find it very hard to find another tune worthy of keeping on your iPod 
 This stand looks okay but it is very unstable.  When I put my monitor on it it took 20 seconds to stop wobbling.  Very unsturdy 
 After enjoying the first novel in this series I was really looking forward to this sequel.  It started out pretty well but soon went downhill.  The plot is barely believable and the "woe is me" and handwringing gets old.  I don't think I'll even bother with the third book - wish I hadn't already bought it 
 It's not easy to criticize this book, because it is beautifully written and captures something tragic and poignant and important:  the emotional trials and conflicts of a spunky twelve year old girl who is coming of age in a world that doesn't understand her.  But McCullers' darker undercurrents taint the book.  Threaded throughout are elements of sexual perversity, terrible sexual boundaries with children, and hints at pedophilia, leading me to question strongly what in the world happened to Carson McCullers when she was a little girl.  Furthermore, the perversity often pops up in a disjointed way that adds nothing to the book's power, and thus reads largely as gratuitous.  A few examples from the book - a book which I did not finish because I didn't trust where its author was taking me:  1) The main character, a pubescent twelve year old girl who is nearly five-foot six, has spent her whole life up till now sleeping in the bed with her widowed and single father, until he looks at her one day and realizes she's "a great big long-legged twelve year old" - McCullers leaves exactly what he means to our imagination - and kicks her out of bed.  2) The girl's best friend is a six year old boy, whom she bullies and torments, and then basically forces to spend the night with her in her bed.  McCullers makes a point of showing how they change their clothes for bed in the same room - "with their backs turned to each other" - and then get in bed together.  Once the little boy is asleep the girl, who is two months away from turning thirteen, rubs his bare stomach with her hand, licks him behind his ear, and then nuzzles up to him.  (Also, imagine if their genders were reversed!)  3) The father takes a married couple as boarders in the house, but the girl - then age nine - walks in on them doing something overtly sexual with the door left purposefully open.  McCullers leaves it to the readers' imagination what her little protagonist viewed.  4) McCullers talks about the girl character, age twelve, having had sex with a neighborhood boy.  Again, she gets vague on details, but why is she sharing even this much?  If you were to remove the literary style and add a scant few more details, you would have child pornography.  5) Eventually the girl changes her name, wears an adult dress that makes her look much older - and goes out on the town and meets a visiting adult soldier.  He comes onto her sexually - though stops only because others come into the bar where he is giving her alcohol.  One is only left to wonder where the book will go from here.  Because this book was written in the 1940s the author can get away with it - and perhaps also because she's a female author - but really, it's disturbing and perverse 
 Who lives outside in barns, begging for food? Well, in a book called The Midwife's Apprentice, Alyce, aslo known as Dung or Brat does. Since she is starving, she asks people for jobs she can do. Aluce finally convines a midwife, called Jane, to give her a job. Alyce also tells Jane if she works, she wants food in return. Jane agrees to the deal, and that's when Alyce journey begins.   I didn't really like this book since it was boring. Even though the book was dull, I think Karen Cushman did a good job of expressing emotions of the characters, like when boys called Alyce names. I also feel a connection to the book. When Aluce didn't do an important assignment, she felt ashamed. I  feel ashamed when I don't do something important properly. Karen Cushman has also written other books like Catherine Called Birdy. Really, I wouldn't reccomend this book to to anybody since it was boring. But I think people could learn from the moral of the story: which is hard work pays of.   
 There is no way this man can be serious.  This book is a joke, it has to be.  It's been a while since I've read it, but while I was reading, I found myself literally marking passages with a pen that were ridiculous, absurd, sometimes bordering on insane.  I can't believe that anyone in their right mind could read this book as anything but parody.  The Enemy Within is not only asinine, but it is also an incredible waste of time - full of pointless anectodes and machismo, rife with typical conservative name calling, Michael Savage is so representative of what is wrong with America today.    Ignorant, bigoted, idiotic.  If these words fit you, you might enjoy The Enemy Within 
 I was disappointed in this book, and felt it wasn't at all to JCO's standards. Like the previous reviewer, Rob's name suddenly changing to Ron pulled me up short.  And I don't think we should necessarily blame the sub editors and proof readers.  It says in the blurb that JCO reads and amends around five times, and this should be enough to pick up on such a major point as a name change before it even gets to the publisher.  Additionally, in a conversation between Ron/Rob and Nikki, he says Auld Lang Sign (sic) and Nikki says that she thinks he means Auld Lang Syne.  If they were having a conversation, how could she tell how he had spelled Syne/Sign as both words sound identical?  I also wondered why the title had been changed from Missing Mom, to Mother, Missing, presumably for the UK market.  The whole book is about 'Mom' and is set in the US, so why change it?  And there is a whole different nuance between the two titles.  One is about emotion, the other more like a police missing person statement.  Did JCO agree to this 
 I suppose everyone who does gluten-free baking is always searching for the holy grail that would make GF products have the same texture as non-GF products.  This gluten substitute is not worth the effort...save your money!  
 I wanted this to work, since I have a house full of unglazed, porous, beige ceramic tile floors with white grout (no, it wasn't my idea). It would be a full-time job just trying to stay ahead of the ground-in dirt that rapidly shows up. And the Scooba did work, at least on the superficial dirt, the first time I used it. Unfortunately, it failed on two counts: it couldn't get out the ground-in dirt; and it broke within a few weeks. To be fair, not much else--short of getting down on my hands and knees and attacking the floor with a scrub brush--gets up the dirt either. But the clincher is that after only a few uses, the Scooba's cover stuck closed and couldn't be reopened without a big struggle. Then getting it reclosed again proved almost impossible. Add this fight to the normal hassle of dealing with all the fiddly little parts in the device, and it just became unusable. Oh, and when it did work, it tended to leak spots of dirty water and leave occasional black "skid marks" on the floor 
 Sorry, I am confused why and African-American woman would be so docile and unable to defend herself. How could she not get a drop on the the main character's assistant -- Oh Come On. Anyway, sorry this book did not do much for me 
 when you reach the second half of life you need ginko biloba to remember what you did fifteen minutes ago. The meaning has always been there.Remember the golden rule - love your neighbor as yourself. Don't waste your money. I read this book and gave it as a gift. I liked it. But I can't remember anything about it 
 I am a great lover of biscotti, especially since I have to watch my sugar intake. Because biscotti can be expensive, I decided to make this simple cookie and have quite successfully.  However, this book is not the book to buy if one wants biscotti of good texture and taste.  I remade one recipe (Almond Biscotti) and tried two others (Coconut Biscotti and Milk Chocolate & Honey) to see if I made a mistake or preferred another flavor, but none of them were worth the effort. They were dry and too hard. The recipes I found on-line and in magazines were much better.  I'll try another book 
 Love the movie, but the quality of the DVD put out by Alpha Video was so bad it was very difficult to watch. The sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up. If you don't want to be disappointed and feel like you've been ripped off, wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one 
 This book de-evolves into a manifesto of what Greeley would like to see in the next Pope. It's almost the author's fantasy scenario about extreme liberalism coming to dominance in the Catholic Church, right down to a Spanish Pope who wears business suits and who used to be a married husband and father. This far-fetched novel has so little material on which to construct a plot that Greeley concocts a love story around his Papal election politics. There is a reconciliation of a married couple on the outs, and a half-hearted aside into a secondary plotline about a man who wants to murder the next Pope. Oh, and Father Greeley drags his favorite Chicago Cardinal into the book to fill more pages and gives the poor old man a life and death personal crisis. This soap opera could have been a good short story but it's a dismal novel. Virgin And Martyr and Angels of September are better books by Andrew Greeley, and a few of the Blackie Ryan mysteries are fun, but White Smoke is a clunker 
 This book didn't cover anything new.  A pre-placement parenting class was required for our homestudy for our adoption, and reading this book was like re-taking that class.  The same issues (generic) were discussed.  Maybe if I hadn't heard all the information before, I would have found this book more valuable 
 The reviewers in this magazine sometimes hit the mark and write with style and insight, but also there are many shallow and cheap shot reviews that are very anemic wanna-be's of true cultural wits like Mencken and Updike. Some of the reviewers suppositions sound as though they are grad student interns, and havent yet lived long in the field of writing to form seasoned viewpoints that are supportable. I'd pass on this superficial pop culture mag, and save your money to buy books that nourish you. 
 I have two adult female cats who don't like each other.  This book didn't give me any new ideas about how to overcome this problem, and for anyone who knows their pets well, this is a complete waste of money.  What REALLY irritated me is that there was a section devoted to male-male aggression but nothing about female-female or male-female problems!!  There were so many glaring omissions about basic cat "body language" and behavior, that I became more annoyed the more I read.  I was VERY disappointed 
 I couldn't even read half of this garbage before wanting to throw it away! Vicki Iovine tells a very negative story of Motherhood, and as a first time Mom to be, I couldn't be more nervous aobut it. Thank God I read many of the other reviews which claim this book is highly exaggerated. I am going to try to return the book tomorrow. Do not waste your time here unless you want to be depressed about Motherhood 
 I purchased the book "The Anatomy of Buzz" and was happy to read about the impact that Word of Mouth marketing has on a product's success.  After reading "Ideavirus...", I was shocked to see that they used Seth Godin's name and quote on the back of it.  The first book was well written and provided several great references and facts that I am still using today.  The "Ideavirus" is, at best, a case study on the tripe people bought during the tech boom (and discarded shortly after the tech bust) to help "further" businesses marketing plans.  The bottom line of the book should have been "see: The Anatomy of Buzz", because while he tries to proclaim that he's found the "thing" that makes a product "sizzle", the reality is that all of the examples in the book were A. good products that B. people told each other about because C. they made life easier.  If you're looking for a good laugh, pick it up.  It's the cheapest laugh (I paid $1.99 used) I've had in a while.  Looking back, some of the non-referenced "facts" (see: "It costs an online retailer $80 just to get people to their storefront!") are downright hilarious 
 Andrew Greeley used to be known for page-turning excitement, vivid characters and an unusual sense of humor.   As his literary output has grown to well over 100 books, his writing has grown lazy and out of touch.  Golden Years is no exception.  Golden Years is the story of how Chucky and Rosemarie O'Malley and their extended family (the "Crazy O'Malleys) cope with the death of Chucky's parents.   On the positive side, the story illustrates how believing Catholics can find hope for life in the death of a loved one.   The scene where the Crazy O'Malleys perform "When the Saints Go Marching In" at the graveside of Chucky's father is one of the few inspired moments in the book.   The sibling rivalry between oldest sister Jane and the rest of the family also rings pretty true.  However, to get to these nuggets, the reader must wade through pages of filler.  This is also the story of Chucky O'Malley falling in love with his wife again.  We know this because the author and the characters tell us this--on nearly every page.   Marital love expressed in playful foreplay and passionate coupling can be life affirming, but gets dull after the 10th or 20th scene.   In this story, the obligatory mystery is mentioned almost in passing and gets solved without breaking a sweat.     Greeley's characters also grow more unbelievable and out of touch.   This book is supposedly about the "Golden Years" of Chucky and Rosemary O'Malley.  The characters are 53 and 49 respectively.  In most people's lives, this is late middle age, a point where parents have to work extra hard to pay for kids in college, marriages, mortgages and saving for retirement.  On Planet Greeley, it is a time of second adolescence where all of their financial needs are taken care of without the necessity of working and they can devote most of their attention to each other.   The O'Malleys live in a beautiful house with an indoor swimming pool which apparently does not have a mortgage payment.   Their five year old child is raised by a live-in nannny (who falls in love with their son).   Their older childrens' college education apparently pays for itself.  If they need to solve a mystery, they can just charter a Gulfstream jet.      To make all of this more infuriating, these idle rich characters go on at length about what great Irish Catholic Democrats they are.   Ronald Reagan, Republicans and anyone in a position of authority are treated as crude, uneducated and lacking the O'Malleys' sophistication.  In the real world, it was just this type of elitist thinking which caused many ethnic Catholics to bolt the Democratic party in the 1980s.     I continue to buy Father Greeley's books in the hope of finding something thought-provoking, inciteful or at least entertaining.  However, with each new disappointment, it is becoming more difficult.         
 Randall may have uncovered just about every fact there is about Thomas Jefferson.  The fact that he dedicated pages evenly to each one is where this book fails.  Thomas Jefferson could be the most complex figure in American history, but most people won't realize that fact from reading this biography because their minds will be numb from reading the first 300 pages of the book dedicated to his early law career that really played little role in the development of Jefferson.  The author tries to justify his inclusion of all this material by theorizing that his contempt for the law system turned Jefferson's mind towards changing the system and thus revolution, and once committed to revolution his ideas on government were influenced by his law teachings, but dedicating 50 pages to Jefferson part in exploting a loop hole in Virinia law to help the First Families acquire more land serves more to make the reader flip through the pages scanning for interesting dates to resume reading.  The real dissapointment in the book is that in spite of all this research, Randall fails to really tackle Jefferson's hypocricies and puzzling political movements.  Perhaps he was unable to find good cause for Jefferson's motives, but to ignore his obvious faults makes this biography toothless.  His borderline treasonous behavior as both Washington's Secretary of State and Adams' Vice-President, his obvious hypocrisy between champion of human equality and slaveowner, and his change of heart about the institution between his authorship of the Declaration and his ascension to the Presidency (along with the glossing over of his decision-making process during the Louisiana Purchase), are all controversial actions of a man usually considered "great" without much examination.  This book would be the proper forum to defend the actions, explain the rationale behind them, or if failing to discover one, call out Jefferson for these personal blemishes.  Randall does none of this, either lamely glossing over the points or omitting them altogether.  After becoming president, the story gets so thin that it makes one wonder if Randall himself got bored with his research and writing of Jefferson's early career that he simply wanted to finish the book.  He chose the wrong part of Jefferson's life to cut from.  The book gets 2 stars for the information it contained, and doesn't get 3 more because of its presentation and lack of the information that it should have.  There must be more engaging biographies of Jefferson than this one 
 I was really disappointed in this book. I loved all of Andre Norton's original Time Traders stories.  This one took half the book to just get the story started!  Not like my old Andre Norton at all.  Spare me any more of these 
 Thank God I didn't have to pay for this book. It's overloaded with information that I didn't find helpful in actually learning to speak Spanish. Even a retired person, such as myself, began to grow impatient with the abundance of information that was not directly related to speaking Spanish. If you really want to get to the "meat" of Spanish vocabulary and grammar, you would do much better by purchasing "Spanish Grammar for Indepedent Learners." It is expensive but I think it's much better than Spanish for Dummies.  But even with Spanish Grammar for Indenpendent Learners, you will still need private lessons or a good Spanish course. If you like learning on your own, Pimsleur is excellent. It's my favorite because the Spanish is very formal, you'd have to go to Spain if you wanted to learn Spanish more formal. If you don't like the formal Spanish and just want to learn Spanish for communicating with employees, customers, co-workers, or for dating, then you may prefer Learning Spanish Like Crazy. 
 I saw the MLP movie and then I got this and was shocked. The witches have the stupidest voices ever! The original voices were SO much better. Even I can do the voices from the REAL movie. Also, the animation has TOO MANY GLITCHES!! 
 I brought this book after reading the reviews of the many people it has clearly helped.  I have suffered from chronic neck pain for many years now.  I wondered if the chronic nature of my pain could be due to emotional or other reasons.   Unfortunately, the book did not help.  It appears that either this is not the cause or I am in the small group of people that Dr Sarno believes need counseling.    One thing I did find frustrating was the abruptness with which the book ended.  Dr Sarno concludes that some people will need counseling to achieve relief.  However he provides no guidance about the type of counseling or what sort of issues may need to be addressed.  I got to the end of the book with no where else to go.  I couldn't envision going to a psychologist and saying "I have neck pain, help me discover what is causing it".    I have since decided that this is not the cause of my problem.  It appears to be an intermittent physical problem.  So far my I've found that yoga and remedial massage have been the most successful in controlling my problem.  Regular yoga in particular often provides weeks and weeks of relief.  This book didn't help me, but from the many glowing reviews it has obviously helped many other people.  Mostly, I wrote this review so that people would be aware that it doesn't work in all cases.   
 There are plenty of obvious factual errors in the book, such as the author's statements that the Yankees have had streaks of 7 & 8 consecutive World Championships. On the other hand, Yankee fans will enjoy  the author's anguish about the Redsox fate 
 One good song on the entire album - South side with Gwen Stefani.  Rest of the songs have some sort of rap guy and not much if any Moby.  Waste of mone 
 For years I've heard women talk about this book and I finally finished it. Nancy Leigh De Moss's book Lies Women Believe and the Truth That Sets Them Free gives a pretty thorough overview of common areas of deception      * Lies about themselves: I should not have to live with unfulfilled longings     * Lies about sin: I cannot walk in consistent victory over sin.     * Lies about their marriage: If I submit to my husband, I will be miserable.     * Lies about their emotions: I can't control my emotions.     * Lies about their circumstances: I just can't take it anymore.  We have all experienced a struggle with at least one of these categories and Nancy sheds some light on these lies and how to be delivered from them to freedom and forgiveness.  The main point I liked from this book was her exhortation to deal specifically with lies in our lives by:     1. Identifying the areas of sinful behavior in our lives    2. Identify the lies at root of that behavior.    3. Replace the lies with the Truth.  I thought Nancy did a good job outlining some of the lies behind feelings and thoughts women have-not believing that God loves you, entitlement, physical beauty matters most, my sin isn't really that bad, it is my responsibility to change my husband, I can't control my emotions, I shouldn't have to suffer and if my circumstances were different, I would be different. As you can see, she covers many of the ways in which we could be deceived. At the end of each chapter she has provided questions to stimulate personal reflection over the material helping the reader-"Agree with God. Accept responsibility. And affirm the Truth." She says at the end of the book, "True freedom is found in a vital, growing relationship with the Lord Jesus." (p. 250) Overall she has some good perspectives.  I found the main premise of this book to actually be pretty confusing. It seems that she is writing to Christian women, but then she says that if she had to describe the majority of Christian women she would use the following words:      frazzled, defeated     exhausted, depressed     burned-out, ashamed     overwhelmed, emotionally unstable     confused, uptight     angry, insecure     frustrated, lonely     discouraged, fearful     and, yes, even suicidal     Bondage is another word that comes to mind when I think of contemporary Christian women...they are not free...by their own admission. (p. 17)  These Christian women don't really sound like Christian women at all. There really is no difference between that list above and the life of a non-Christian woman. It isn't to say that the Christian woman does not struggle with some of those things, I know I have felt exhausted, overwhelmed, angry and discouraged, but can a Christan woman be in bondage to something other than God?  I looked up the word bondage in the dictionary and it presents the idea of someone being subject to, controlled and mastered by something. If a Christian woman struggles in her relationship with God because she thinks, "God isn't good. If her were He would______." Nancy's method to evaluate the lie and replace it with the truth is very helpful, but I don't think Scripture describes a real Christian being mastered by doubt or fear, or anything other that the Lord.  In Romans 6:16-18 Paul writes:      "Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves, you are slaves to the one whom you obey--whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness? But thanks be to God that, though you used to be slaves to sin, you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were entrusted. You have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness."   Throughout this book, De Moss wants the reader to know that they are not alone and that struggling with these deceptions is very normal. She offers Biblical hope in saying that change is possible through the person of Jesus Christ and the power of the truth of God's Word. In using terms like "bondage" or "enslaved to_____" to describe Christians, but in light of Romans 6, I think De Moss is confusing the need for "sanctification" with the need for "justification."      * Being justified is a one time event in which a sinner is made right with God. Justification is the moment where through faith in Christ a person is set free from sin, judgment and eternal death and given a relationship with God and the power of the Holy Spirit. At justification, God makes you a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17), you are filled with the Holy Spirit and empowered to resist temptation and pursue righteousness.      * Being sanctified is the lifelong process of putting off sin and putting on holiness.  If someone has not been justified they cannot be sanctified. This book was in need of clarity on this point.  All in all this book offered some Biblical insights on lies that we women believe. A Christian woman using good discernment can glean some great things from this book, but I don't know that I would really recommend it. Instead of this book I would suggest Martha Peace's new book Damsels in Distress: Biblical Solutions for Problems Women Face 
 I should have read this comment before i bought the book. Now is too late, i have it just to occupy my bookshelf. After fist few chapters, i was very doubtful of the techniques.  The book is very questionable especially when you move to the middle part which makes no sense or too difficult to believe it will work.  
 From a new grad student's perspective, i have to say that this book is absolutely terrible!!  The writers provided NO useful examples in the chapters and for the examples that are there, they never showed how they generated the results.  Its pretty obvious that these guys are not interested in teaching and that very little thought was put into this book.  I would recommend this book be banned from the classroom 
 My son is 2 and a half and this was his first bike.He looks adorable on the bike but unless I want to go over and help him he can't seem to manage on his own.Why?Well the darn trike is impossible to steer for one and secondly it tips over very easily.It is really unsturdy.Also what is up with no breaks? This is a cute bike to take some pics looking cute but for serious bike riding..forget it! -mom in Orlando,F 
 I firmly agree with the message of this compliation - George W. Bush's illegal, immoral administration needs to go, and soon - but this CD is AWFUL.  These bands are 'punk'?  No.  NO.  'Punk' is the Ramones, the Sex Pistols, Television, Black Flag.  You want good political punk?  Go for the Clash, Dead Kennedys, or Minor Threat.  You want good political music in general?  Grab Rage Against The Machine's debut (yeah, yeah, they spawned the nu-metal scourge, but you'd have to be a corpse or a Republican to tell me this album doesn't make you wanna stand up and revolt), Sepultura's Chaos A.D. (but for the love of God, avoid the turdfest that is Roots), or some System Of A Down.  HOWEVER:  You'll notice I gave the CD two stars.  Well, those stars come from one song in particular:  "No W" by Ministry.  This song is amazing.  Ministry is a great band, and far too strong to be plonked in with all these no-talent hacks like Less Than Jake and NOFX and Alkaline Trio.  Hell, Ministry aren't even punk!  They're industrial metal!  "No W" is thrash metal with voice samples and keyboards!  And it RULES!  But you could just skip that and buy Ministry's Houses Of The Mole instead.  The song's on that too.  In short:  download 'No W', skip the rest, and use the money you were going to spend on this CD to finance a different progressive cause 
 OK, I don't know what these other reviewers are listening to, but this is the most stale, unemotional music I've heard out of TD up to that point. I prefer Cyclone over this album anyday. My copy says that it's "live" but no mention is made of the venue. Maybe it's a type-o or it's "live-in'studio". But it's very plastic-sounding and repetitive. Let me go back in time: The album came out around 1980. At that time there was the beginning of the digital revolution and synths were becoming more complex, with new synthetic instruments being produced and gaining popularity. TD was always in the forefront, using the latest and greatest gear. One problem at the time was that many of these synths lacked what is called "velocity sensitivity". That's the effect you get when you play a piano hard or soft, you get two very diffenrent sounds, plus all the variations possible in between. These new synths lacked that ability for another year or two. The sequencing equipment, though more complex, also lacked the ability to record velocity info, so everything comes out at the same volume. Now this effect was perfect for the new synth-pop and New Wave music that eventually led to that dark and emotionless period in music history known as "the 80's". So therefore you get TD playing synths with lots of tonal possibilities but very little expressiveness. The same problem is in evidence on Jean-Michele Jarre's Magnetic Fields album. No soul. Now the music itself is rather lackluster, even poppy in parts, and downright embarrassing in other parts. I could see Edgar Froese taking over after Pete Baumann left, and getting caught up in the possibilities of the new synth technology. It resulted in this case in an album that sounds VERY dated, unlike much other TD music. I suppose this music would have it's fans but someone who appreciates TD's adventurous nature will not help but be surprised that TD could put out such bland stuff. Then again what followed for twenty years was pretty much in the same vein or worse, though I'm still looking for the exceptions. Buy at your own risk 
 If you want a book to read about Fidel Castro, to tell you the truth about the revolution and himself then steer well clear of this book. This book is nothing more than an aggressive, and completely unfounded attack on Fidel Castro. You can learn nothing from this book other than Fidel liked his ladies...WOW! The author, despite her claim to the contary in the forward, hates Fidel Castro. She shoots herself in the foot by pages eight when she, while listing Castro's "faults" (all of which can be justified when you take into account outside influences), gives a bitter rendition of "America's humiliating defeat at the Bay of Pigs." Like he was just going to sit around and LET America steal his people's country. The Bay of Pigs was a glorious victory, America should never have stuck their noses in in the first place. Viva Fidel Castro! Soy Fidelista contentisima 
 I do like cinematic journeys to exotic places and new experiences. So imagine my disappointment to find that the title of the movie was merely referring to a particular Chinese opera.   But there is a journey here. However, only from blue-tinted Japan to villages in warmly colorful Yunnan Province in China. (This a message film but I don't know if the color pallette is part of it.)   As for the message...Aging Japanese icon Ken Takakura wears one facial expression thru out the movie. It was his character's mask. And his character finds himself in China to record his dying son's obsession, a Chinese 'Masked' Opera. Get it? And he's been 'riding alone' since his estrangement from his son. Get it? And the opera singer the old man sought out has his own young son that he hasn't seen and wants to. Get it? So much for subtlety.  In a daring move, Zhang Yimou used non-actors in many of these roles. For this sub-title reader, that daringness worked. Other unique elements, however, didn't work. In fact, they were unwelcome.  I've always wanted to see the difficulties of a foreigner in a land without translators (or inadequate ones) presented realistically. But, now I see why this isn't done very often. With a few exceptions, this proved very difficult to pull off without dragging down the drama.  I've often wondered how long before we see some of the more hidden aspects of life brought to the screen. Zhang Yimou is daring. So we now have a scene with a cascade of snot falling from a crying man's nose, and a scene with a child squatting to genuinely relieve himself. Now I know why those scene aren't done more often.   Without Gong Li or Zhang Ziyi, I've found Zhang Yimou movies to be almost repugnant. Borrowing from Ayn Rand: his "sense of life" as epitomized by his movies is fatalistic and bitter and ugly despite the beauty of his visuals.   I like gentle, naturalistic experiences. But not when, in total, they depress me. This movie was, for me, a thousand screenshots of downer 
 This is the ONLY Heinlein work I don't like and have read only once, and I've read everything he wrote that I could get my hands on for more than thirty years (since I was a teenager). I've literally worn out multiple softcover copies of several of his novels, and starting to do the same in hardcover, especially "I Will Fear No Evil" and "Time Enough for Love." I'm sorry to say, however, Heinlein completely lost me with "Job"- it's not a 'comedy,' it's a travesty 
 I wished I could write a good review for this book.  However, I can't.  I read it.  From a literary standpoint, the book is an obvious polemic.  Ever evil under the sun can be traced to men, Christianity, and society run by men, (in about that order).    However, her book suffers many flaws.  First, she makes some outrageous claims with absolutely no documentation.  Second, she makes some outrageous claims with WRONGFUL documentation.  That is, whenever one troubles themselves to find the book that she is referencing, it does not say what she says that it does.   Third, many of the books that she uses are outdated and also biased.  Almost none of the theories espoused by her have any connection to any modern scholarship.  For example, she says that the Arabian religion prior to Muhammad was based upon a group of female prophets who believed the Qur'an was inscribed upon the tablets of destiny much the same as the Goddess Tiamet has absolutely no verifiable reference.  I've read many Islamic studies and many dissident scholars, but none of them say that.  Wonder why?  Same, she gives no reference for that quote.  Because she is worthless as a primary reference, each and every thing she says must be independently confirmed by someone less biased and more reliable.  That means, once one goes through the trouble, two things.  First, her book is worthless as a source unto itself.  Second, whenever this trouble is undertaken, most of it is outdated or plain fabricated.  Much the same as she accuses Christian authors.  (And I have no bias toward Christianity.)  
 Good product, forget about service. I e-mailed InFocus about my faulty projector 8th January 2005 it is now 7th January 2006 and I still do not have my projector. That's right, it's been ONE YEAR since my projector stopped working, I have given up on it being repaired (it was under warranty) and am now struggling to get it back so that I can repair it out of my own pocket. Check this company's record at  the Better Business Bureau, it is deemed to be unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints 
 Communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history, responsible for the extermination of 100+ million people. This book (which started it all) holds at least much of the blame. Communists were and still are a threat to the free world, and communism is a slave system. Some "intellectuals" actually support the tired mantras of Marx's philosophy, whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven't seen enough sunlight, I don't know. In any case, if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property, and is totalitarian and slave-driving (the government owns everything, including you). And the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up. Pol Pot, Mao, Stalin (of course), etc etc...who are these people kidding 
 This is one of those books that's so bad you can use it to judge critics -- because if *anybody* says it's well written, or well plotted, or has good characterizations, THEY'RE NUTS.  The fact is, there's NO characterization, the sentence constructions are painful, and at least one major plot point is impossible.  (If you're paying even a minimum of attention, you'll put the book down and go, "HUH?")  This book is good for exactly one thing:  it shows you don't have to spend a lot of time writing a book -- or even be a competent writer -- to have a best seller.  I don't mind mindless escapism -- heck, I'll give Janet Evanovitch two thumbs WAY up -- but when it's a trash heap like this it gives reading a bad name 
 It started out as a murder mystery. I was pleasantly surprised. Then, it introduced the "affair" and that was it for me. The book became more about desperate housewives looking for love in all the wrong places. Please. Isn't this a little played out? I was not as impressed as everyone else was with this book. The book was overhyped. Sorry, but it's true. 
 Tour of Duty was just another example of the ineptitude of the Kerry people and how they underestimated the survivors, the real heroes of Vietnam. Perhaps Kerry, Brinkley and company thought that these brave heroes would forget or would not come forward or were dead.   Perhaps Kerry and his  minions thought that nobody would check and let Kerry get away with his flagrant lies about heroism. NOT ON OUR WATCH!  The title of t his book is also just another example of how Kerry tries to align himself with hollywood. In this case, taking a title that was a popular tv show. Sorry, but the actors in that tv show were better. The only comparison is that in both cases, it is all ficion. In the case of this book, the fiction part has been taken to an extreme.  Nice try, but this pr campaign to try to land Kerry a seat in the oval office didn't work. Too many people know the facts about Kerry.  I also recommend that you check out wintersoldier.com for more info on Kerry. The real John Kerry 
   This can't be Outkast. It just can't be. Thats what I kept tellin myself as I skipped thru the album. I was a HUGE fan of their first 3 albums. But there was NO way for me to know that this one would be wack. They were wrong. Releasing {So fresh so clean} & {Miss Jackson} as singles. That was misleading in everyway. Those singles were OK to me when I heard em on the radio. But compared to the other tracks on the album those 2 might as well be gold. ... Beware, this album is Str8,100% pure, concentrated GARBAGE. It almost hurts to say that bout em. But when I remember how they hurt me {and many others} with this trash I ....   They were HUGE around the time this album was made. It shows. They just went into the studio and said things into the mic. They musta made those WACK beats themselves {while high} SURELY they didn't pay someone to do that. 
 This was one of these books I'd usually pick off the library shelf,  glance quickly through it and put it right back. I thought there was too much fluff. What I found most annoying was that the author inserted unrelated myths or anecdotes, etc., sometimes in mid-paragraph, with seemingly no rhyme or reason, that had me searchng for the next relevant page 
 This CD isn't horrible, but it's pretty bland. She has a good voice, but she doesn't use it on this album. Either she's trying to purr like Britney or scream like Christina, but she doesn't manage to do either one quite as good. Jessica, stick to pop music, Christmas music is not for you 
 Al Franken is an individual who has been mediocre at everything, this book is his attempt to take on radio giant, rush limbaugh.  All I can say is; it is a good thing Mr Franken used Rush's name on the title, otherwise this book would have been like every other Franken project: an abject failure.  If you are easily entertained by shrill, and hysterical name calling this book is for you.  I found it sophmoric, and superficial, pretty much like Al 
 If you were a Ludlam fan, and begin reading this book, you will be reminded immediately that he is dead.  How sad that a byline has turned into a trademark.   If you have a distaste for subtlety, and prefer ideas repeated and underlined in red, buy this book.  Shameful exploitation of a decent name 
 First off let me state for the record that I only buy Sony , but I have to advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman. I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006, as I had purchased replacement insurance and was able to return it because it broke. It is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open, not to mention the headphones always pull out. The FM receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable. Save your self the hassel!!!!! 
 lmao at this album. "I have rims, yeah, by the way I have big shiny rims, and oh yeah, did I mention I have rims? Big shiny ones! And hoes too!"  Manny Fresh is an incredibally bad lyricist, the beats are dull, and everyone praising this garbage is no doubt from the south, where virtually NO good hip hop acts exist with the exception of Scarface and Outkast 
 Recieved this item and only turned it on twice, everything seemed to work fine and sounded great, when I tried to tuen system back on doesn't seem to have any power. I have tried several outlet and still no power. I guess I paid for just for show and no music 
 This was the worst item I ever paid over $200 for. Maybe got 20 hours of use-at most. Mintek Digital did not back their product. I cannot believe that the positive reviews did not come from employees or shills for the company. Sent the unit to be fixed. Told me it couldn't be fixed and I should buy a new one or pay $10.00 to get this unit back. I recommend all users contact the Attorney General in their state to file a complaint about this worthless product and company 
 Really, folks, spend the money on a gym membership, go outside and play with your dog, play soccer with your kids, or spend time in the afternoons working in the yard or the house after warming up with slow movements and a power walk.  Be reasonable.  Just remain aware of how your body feels, know your limits (i.e. knees, back, elbows) and don't over do it!  It takes time to find your own approach to weight/figure management.  You can do it your own way.  You don't need this thing AT ALL.      This product will NOT bring you any satisfaction.  you'll only feel stupid for getting sucked into the infomercial and wasting time when you could've been watching Saturday morning cartoons!!!  In the infomercial it shows you "all the machines" you have to use at the gym.  Well, there's a reason people use them- becuase their tried and true.  Those machines, well worth the cost of a membership, guide the user in producing precision movements.  THey cost thousands of dollars and are built to be absolutely sturdy.  You're better off using machines at the gym(hey, don't forget the YMCA), varying your cardio between outdoor and indoor exercise, and throwing in consistant measures of Pilates and Yoga, if you want to "change your body."  This is just another stupid product, we've seen them come and go for years.  It won't be around long, folks...  Disappoint will occur, and the probabilty that injury will occur is well within the realm of possibility.      
 To violent for anyone! This movie is horrible. The cast is good, but the plot stinks! Its just this family who have super powers. Then this kid wanted to be Mr. Incredibles side kick. (in a way)Mr. Incredible says no so then he hates him. Then the kid turns evil and kills people, and wants every body to like him. Thats origanal. There are barely any jokes you laugh once every 20 minutes, and there is way to much violence. Killing, guns, punching, bombs, and they say stupid words sometimes. I do not like the person who directed this film because he should not like violence. So I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Especially the 2 disc special edition! 
 Superheroes escaping impossible situations.  Villains dreaming up new threats.  Existing threats constantly working to get enough energy to become dangerous.  SSDD.  Pretty boring.  If not for the errant knight, this wouldn't have been worth reading 
 My roomate who is devoutly Catholic has this book and I decided to read it, because to be honest, if I read all history books that I would agree with, I would find that my world was very narrow and one-sided.  Let me first start with some of the positives.  1. The book did present an orthodox perspective on many historical events in the early church.  Some of these examples include the debate over the Trinity, Divinity of Christ Gnosticism and other controversies that were prevalent during this time period.  2. His research and work on Thomas Aquinas was excellent.  His examination of the early Scholastic movement was by far the best portion of this book.  3. He does criticize those in the church who abused their positions prior to and during the time of the Reformation.  However, this was brief and will lead into some later criticisms.  4. He does actively criticize liberal Catholics who would see the church morph into something that has no basis in the Scriptures or in Church history.    Despite, these positives, there are many aspects of this book which are historically inaccurate and present an idealized picture of Church history which reflects a tendency to show a one-sides view of the Catholic Church.  In this way, he moves away from being a historian and instead becomes an Catholic Apologist in the same vein as Karl Keating and others.  Criticisms (especially concerning the Protestant Reformation):  1. His utter dismissal of Eastern Orthodox and Protestant Churches as heretical.  On page 111, he describes eastern Christianity as being a "hotbed of heresy."  It would seem that all Christian faiths outside of Roman Catholicism are untrue and without merit    2. Protestants particularly are treated with disdain.  Luther in particular is vilified as a rebel.  He quotes selectively from Luther in order to paint him as a wild and irrational human being.  While Luther's later anti-semitism is well worth being criticized or condemned, Crocker goes too far in tying Luther to Hitler and the Holocaust.  Also, he does a disservice in creating a false portrait of Erasmus as a superior theologian to Luther.  3. Along the same lines, Calvin is given some credit as being the greatest Protestant theologian, but he is ultimately dismissed as creating the first "Christian Police State."  Now, Calvin again was a man who was imperfect, but his Geneva Republic which he called an "Aristocracy bordering on Democracy" was one of the first attempts since ancient times to create a system of checks and balances and representative government that had not been terribly evident in the Middle Ages.  In the American context, it might be interesting to note that Calvinism (in its distrust of human nature) was influential in helping the American Founders to create a system of checks and balances whereby we got our Executive, Legislative and Judicial Bodies.  Also, Crocker's comparision of Calvin's view of art to the ACLU was a cheap shot that could have been omitted.  With some of these thoughts in mind, I recommend reading this book to provide a one-sided view of history.  However, I would not read this as a detailed and non-partisan account of history.  A better book that is historically more sound and would seem to be non-partisan would be "The Protestant Reformation" by Diarmaid MacCulloch is a much more unbiased look at the Reformation.    
 This is the lamest of Ry Cooder's CDs. Save your money and find a copy of soundtrack to Blue City, a forgetable (thank God!) movie with wonderful music 
 Here is another air-headed businessman who wants to go out in political glory.  Ross Perot wanted the same thing, and all he managed to do was bring the Clintons into the White House with a minority of the popular vote, and then later exit the political stage whining about NAFTA.  George Soros thinks he is more dangerous, and perhaps he is.  He has a few more billion dollars.  But, hey!  Get a load of the man's strategy!  He's an American citizen, but, unlike Ross Perot, he refuses to stand up and say what he believes in, and RUN FOR OFFICE!  Nope!  George likes being the Shadow In The Background, committing countless shadowy acts through his shadowy network of political groups.  Would it help anyone to realize that Georgie Soros was unable to finish his Big Book Of Philosophy?  He couldn't find the logic to do it!  How about the fact that (ho ho!) his last name is actually Esperanto?  "Soros" is Esperanto, for "we shall soar!"  You can buy this book and read it, if you have nothing better to do with your time.  Much better to read the Austrian economists, however -- not this amateur misrepresentation of Karl Popper 
 If you're an armchair general who never served in the military and who believes that professors know more about war than soldiers, this is the book for you.  If you love dreary writing, buy two copies.  If tendentious history is your thing, buy three.  This is campus arrogance with little sense of the complexity, confusion and danger of battle.  But if you're just aching to believe that generals are all dummies, and that anybody with a doctorate in international relations could run our wars better than the men and women who sweat, bleed and die for our country, this is the perfect book for you.  Good trees died for this 
 For a group that exudes such passion in their music (LIVE FROM BUFFALO anybody?) this song is like a funeral dirge. I can only hope that they haven't released the full album because they are trying to rekindle the passion that has made them the fan-favorite that they are.  Take your time guys - let's get your BEST work.   T 
 The basic argument of this book is that psychotherapy is wrong and should be abolished. Any thesis can be legitimately supported, provided that the arguments used are logical. Unfortunately, this book is a bizarre patchwork of unrelated facts and illogical arguments. It reads like an angry statement "against", with no constructive goal in sight.  Masson sees abuse and injustice everywhere in psychotherapy. In his description of psychotherapy, the author is like somebody who is looking at the world through a pair of glasses that filter out all colours, except for the black. Seeing only shades of black in the world, he complains of how awful and oppressive this view is. And it certainly is, because he set himself up for this experience from the very beginning. Adopting his viewpoint, one could say exactly the same about most aspects of life, for example school, family, work, the judicial system, the political system. And is the solution to just dismantle all these institutions, like the author suggests to do with psychotherapy? One quickly realises how far removed from reality this proposition is.   Masson states that psychotherapy is inherently bad. This statement raises a number of questions: Can emotional distress be studied? Can it be managed? Can people help one another, and how? These are very interesting questions, but unfortunately Masson doesn't seem interested in them. He simply states that psychotherapy should cease to exist. "It can and should be replaced by open and searching criticism of the very foundation of our society" (p.295) This is such an idealistic statement. Is this all he would suggest to somebody who is looking for help? The only attempt he makes to offer a practical idea is about "self-help groups that are leaderless and avoid authoritarian structures, in which no money is exchanged, that are not grounded on religious principles [...], and in which all participants have experienced the problem they come to discuss". When this is all he has to offer in a book of 300 pages, you quickly realise that his work lacks a constructive intent.  Another problem with the book is that Masson's highly biased approach when describing different orientations to therapy makes his work lack credibility. For example, the chapter on Gestalt consists of a series of judgments about Fritz Perls as a person; only a few words are spent on his method. Reading the section on Ericksonian hypnotherapy, you have the impression that Masson skimmed through various books about Erickson, found some case histories that shocked him, and that he cut and pasted portions of such case histories into his book. This is a very poor representation of the Ericksonian approach. Such lack of objectivity discredits Masson's work. Not knowing anything about some of the therapists described in the book, I am inclined to think that Masson has misrepresented them just as much as he has misrepresented Erickson, and therefore the credibility of the whole book drops low.  However, I believe that there is some good to be found in "Against therapy". Even if its main contention is unreasonable and poorly supported, the fact that Masson's ideas are so extreme provokes the reader into taking a stand and making her/his own judgment about what is right, what is wrong and what you're not sure of.   One other important theme underlying most of the book's arguments is that psychotherapy reflects and expresses the social and political environment where therapy lies. However Masson does not attempt to develop this theme. People like Wilhelm Reich have written extensively about the social and political implications of therapy. The book makes no mention of these writings, which is a huge omission.  It would have made more justice to its work if Masson had titled the book something like "Abuses and violence in psychotherapy and psychiatry." If you are looking for examples of such situations, the book offers interesting materials and is food for thought. If you are looking for an objective and logical discussion of psychotherapy, look elsewhere 
 This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  I knew from the very beginning of the movie that there was no way I was going to be able to stay awake through the whole thing.  I was right; I fell asleep about fifteen minutes into it.  Recently, I was offered the chance to watch it again.  I thought, "OK, I didn't see the whole thing, it might have gotten better, so I'll give it another chance." ... Bad mistake.  This little tale about a horse race across a vast desert did nothing to hold my interest for very long.  Hidalgo is the name of the horse.  So what?  That's about as boring as this movie.  So why the 1-star markup? Cause the main character is played by Viggo Mortensen, of Aragorn fame in the smash movie series The Lord of the Rings- and I do like Viggo.  I did not, however, like this movie.  It's kind of fitting it should be set in a desert- cause that's exactly where this movie should be buried, never to bore another wave of audiences again.  If you find yourself overworked and in need of a nice long nap, watch Hidalgo; you'll be out in no time 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 If you are interested in this book, good chances you have a child with Asperger Syndrome or PDD-NOS. You should familiarize yourself with these topics before labeling him/her an Einstein 
 If you have read these in the paper you are no doubt aware that Family Circus is trite and vapid. But if you think that this book somehow contains the jems that you somehow missed, please don't be fooled. I picked this up at a friends house after asking myself "why would sombody buy this?". The answer is This is the most undesirable gift to ever grace a white elephant gift exchange. If you want to see everybody scramble to get rid of a gift, just throw this waste of paper in the mix, but please don't buy it yourself 
 History Goes to the Movies : A Viewer's Guide to the Best (and Some of the Worst) Historical Films Ever Made, by Joseph H. Roquemore.  I recently finished reading this and can't recommend it.  My attitude can be summed up by saying that I don't trust the author's qualifications either as a reviewer of cinema or as an historian.  Glaring mistakes abound in his recitation of historical "facts".  Worse, the author frequently allows his political views to dictate his cinematic opinions, i.e., a film that promotes left-wing values or ideas cannot be any good, regardless of any other considerations.  The biggest crime is inconsistency: many films (that he doesn't like) are slammed for the most minor of historical inaccuracies, while films that he *does* like get passes on even the most absurd of historical gaffes.  Finally, the choices and classification of films into different historical periods is somewhat eclectic; some very obvious films are completely omitted, and many of the films reviewed were never intended as "history" of any sort!  That being said, there are some good points.  There are a lot of films covered here, a number of which I had never heard of or knew very little about, and I wouldn't mind checking some of them out.  Roquefort's grasp of history seems better in some eras than in others (as is true of most of us, I guess) and when he's accurate he makes some good points.  Overall, however, I cannot recommend this book to anyone with a serious interest in either history or cinema. 
 Country singers either sing about being drunk, drinking, having sex, or being patriotic. Well not that last one anymore, since 9-11 is a few years old. Hasnt anyone ever heard of quailty music anymore? Listen to Hank Williams or Marty Robbins. Thats real music. Hank sings about drinking but he actully wrote his songs, not like 90% of the country artist today. Plus, Hank can sing better then anyone in country today. 
 Mouse movement is extremely slow. It literally takes 10 (!) seconds to get from one side of the screen to another (800x600). I just got it from OfficeDepot [...].  Buttons are too small and hard to control. Joystick is unresponsive 
 I found this book rather boring and filled with unneccessary rhetoric rather than truth.  Koren is obviously a decent writer, however, she tries too hard in this book.  Her experiences with alcohol are nothing extraordinary and the only thing painted in a poor light throughout this memoir is her; not alcohol.  She drank to such excess so many times that halfway through I thought there would be some type of climax in one of these unfortunate experiences.  But there wasn't.  It was just more of the same over and over again.  Also, a lot of assumptions were made.  I don't think every girl remembers their first drink.  I think Koren remembers because she is an alcoholic.  I couldn't tell you the first drink I had or when it was or anything about it.  It is unimportant.  I also think there is more to Koren fearing affection from a man.  That was strange too me.  When you are 14 or 15, I understand, but 20 and 21?  Come on.  That's just an excuse she gave herself for her drinking.  Overall, I thought the hype surrounding this book was just that; hype.  There wasn't much too it.  There was too many references to mid90's pop culture and it appears too me that Koren didn't really even start drinking in excess until she joined her sorority.  I felt that you never really got to know the truth about the writer; you got to know the version of the truth that the writer wants to be true.  
 I've read just about everything Nora Roberts has written. I cannot believe Nora Roberts actually wrote this - it must have been a ghost writer.  The characters lack all the charm and depth one expects to find in a Roberts novel.  I won't be moving on to the next two novels - I simply don't care enough about any of the characters to see what happens to them 
 This CD sounds like a Prom band in a bad movie or something you would hear at a Wake. I waited months to hear Gerald's music be butchered? This and a few other Jazz Tributes should be removed from the market 
 No one dies, as they do in most Steele novels, but "Klone" is entertaining anyhow.  Recommend as an audio listen, not as a read 
 I thought I would love this book...and out of all the viking series I did like it.  But it was poorly written.   I have seen that Ms. Coulter does rewrite some of her novels this is definitely one of them that needs to be reproduced.  She had one to many loopholes that aggravate me as the reader.   I loved Miranda's character.  In my opinion out of all her characters I've read, I've only liked Alexandra Sherbrooke as my ideal woman next to Miranda.   What was disappointing there was not enough more combatative fighting between Miranda and those that kidnapped her nor just a visual between her brother and her.     Secondly with Miranda and Rorik...there was no romance.  I cannot figure how a man moves from detesting the woman to deciding to marry her...although there was a small explanation or round about, mainly Rorik's thoughts on how strong she is and capable.  But besides the romance...the sex scenes were horrid.   It seemed cold and clinical.  There was no passion.   Between Douglas and Alexandra, or even the Legacy/Brides/ and the rest of the Viking sagas..there was some kind of passion that gets you excited and into the hero.  But Rorik was horrid as a lover and poor Miranda just seemed unimpressed..until she decided to take things into her own hands...and then she had to be ill before that was sucessful.  So the quality of romance/passion was utterly lacking in this fic.  My main concerns would be to develop Miranda more and give her a bit more nuances, and expand on her fighting skills with a bit more action.    Another would be to definitely romanticise a bit of the sex scenes at least and give them a bit more loving relationship.  That is not only based on a marriage of convenience.     I think those two would change things a great deal and really improve the book 
 The poses in this book are indeed very dynamic and interesting but the one MAJOR draw-back is that they are all with the models laying down on the ground. Definitely not a very practical figure reference book for an illustrator like myself. I mean lets be honest, how many times are you going to be drawing a figure contorted on the ground verses standing and engaged in some sort of action. It may, however, be possible too adapt some of the poses for a standing position and yet gravity affects the body completely differently when it is horizontal instead of vertical. The photographs themselves are very poor in terms of quality in that they are: muddy, bad resolution, slighty out of focus, badly lit etc. etc. etc. Basically this was a very disappointing purchase. The "Fairburn System" series is far better than this book for photographic figure reference material; however, very hard to find 
 I bought this book and was looking for some insight of what one can do to help with my dog's behavior due to trauma from her past owner and dog walking issues and social issues. This book was so boring to begin with.  The Other End of the Leash, this book didn't even go into any training techniques, Patricia Connell just was so into her own dogs, that I felt like I was reading a expose' on her dog's lives.  Did I gain any insight on remedies to help me along with my dog I rescued who has trauma and is an alpha female dog and can't walk on a leash or socialize with other dogs/people.  No, I ended up giving the book away before even finishing the last chapter.  Enough of Ms. McConnell's writings, my time was wasted and I could not use any of what I read in her book to my situation.   I would not recommend this book for anyone's reading if it is to solve your dog's issues.  
 This has all of the features of the headset that came with my phone, and it was much less expensive than buying a replacement headset from T-mobile.  Brand new, and I had to jiggle the cable near the plug to get it to work. In order to fit anyone but a newborn I had to pull the earpieces apart, which could have broken the wires if I weren't careful, and may tear further through wearing it.   The mike is located symmetrically from both earpieces; this means that the mike is lodged at my addams apple.   There are several places which I'm worried will break soon through normal wear and tear. The ear pieces are hard plastic, and look like they'll be uncomfortable if worn for a long time. The reason I needed stereo headsets in the first place was to listen to music. Also be warned that shipping was listed as $5 for a $7 item, when it was sent in an envelope that only needed 2-3 stamps.  The cable is barely 3 feet long from mike to plug, so I don't recommend it for tall people.  It will do until I can find better, but that's the best I can sa 
 There was a time when I thought no one wrote self-indulgent pap as well as Bellow, but in light of A Theft, I may change my mind.  The other reviewers seem to agree on the absence of plot; I suggest that this novella receive goose eggs in the character development and dramatic tension categories as well.  Considering how beautifully Bellow can write when he's making the effort, this book is particularly offensive.  Note to Bellow newcomers -- don't give up without reading Mr. Sammler's Planet 
 This movie was obviously made by Japanese fans of several American films.  It then tried to mix them all together in one film.   The main ones are the Matrix, Reservoir Dogs, and Night of the Living Dead.  Especially the Matrix.  We have several yakuza meeting at a specified location where they usually bury their victims, the location turns out to be a forest of reincarnation so their victims are coming back to life.  Then it is a dead-come-back-to-life genre gore film heavy with feuding Yakuza elements.  Our main character has the long black Matrix type coat and general emotionless demeanor.   The high-tech 360 camera movements of the Matrix are blatantly being imitated minus the high-tech aspect.  Instead it is obvious that the camera itself is being moved 360 around the action.  I really hated the Matrix so a film mainly paying tribute to the Matrix already has a big strike against it.  As for the other elements, they were all brought in awkwardly and it just seemed to constantly extend the story with another element of their favorite American movies that they wanted to include.  The gore was mostly uncreative and uninteresting.  Note that if you are looking for something different than typical American movies by checking out those wacky Japanese movies, you will not get it here 
 I believe that these authors received a big kickback from large factory farms and big business 
 I was so excited to receive my first issue of Art In America, and I was severly disappointed to see that it is mostly full-page ads for galleries in Europe.  There are very few articles or artist Bios.  The photos are beautiful, but don't get this if you were hoping to learn anything about American artists or galleries 
 Check out the viewable sample of the book first!  I looked through the index and it doesn't even have an entry for lycanthrope or lycanthropy.  What kind of Werewolf Encyclopedia would omit the scientific terminology for a werewolf 
 I can't argue with the fact that the author knows his research material.  The problem is that the book is so full of examples, that it makes for a very difficult and painful read.  There is no flow, no voice, just examples.  And I mean multiple examples in one paragraph.  No real analysis, just a compression of facts and other information. This would have been better off as a bibliography and not an attempt at an actual book 
 Reading the title and description of this book, I was excited about reading it. I found the writing not up to the task! Despite having a great deal of interest in the subject, after scanning the book I decided not to read it 
 The monitor works really well. The functions are a bit limited from the perspective of calorie counting and fitness tracking.   If you are looking for a good basic monitor, this is a great unit. 
 This is not a dictionary you can download onto your memory card. It comes on its own memory card, which you have to insert into your pda to use. You have to carry this dictionary card around with you and when you want to look something up, take your card out of your pda and then insert this one. It's impractical. For me it was a waste of money. 
 Sure this book is only for beginner or outsider of Cosulting business. But then, for the price of this book, I would rather buy a much cheaper book but with more useful information and ideas - such as Consulting for Dummies. The book is full of motherhood statements and it is more liked written by a grand mom and she called herself consultant; But come on, Consulting is a highly skillful business that require structural, systematic yet creative thinking. Overall, I think this book is a waste of money for experienced consultant. While for beginner, the reader will risk the wrong impression that it's this easy to win a consulting work - highly unlikely in a complex and competative world 
 The Buteyko method is a superb therapy for asthma. Teresa Hales book touches on it but does not contain it. There are many books available which are worthy of reading especially if you have asthma, fatigue and other complaints. For example- do a search for Asthma Free naturally, Every Breath you take, The Buteyko Manual or a very simple read with all exercises called Close Your Mouth.  Good luck and healthy breathin 
 We read this book in a senior lit class and I have to say that it lulled me to sleep.  The entire book centers around a young woman trying to find out her past. A lovely story, the only problem is that within 300 pages.. nothing to really inticing to the reader happens.  Almost every page tells you to fall asleep and give up as the book has no real point until the end.  I don't know why someone said it is heart-felt.  Maybe I wouldread this book again if I was trying to fall asleep at 2 in the morning and an antihistimine hadn't put me to sleep well enough 
 as I remember when i watched the original chinese version, although it wasnt any big deal but I did like it as I remember, but this version is totally destroy that feeling, something about the translation is just bad to the core makes the movie like a piece of crap, especially some sound effect. Why don't they put the original track in it I hard can understand. if u can find some asian version and rewatch it u would agree with me. it worth my 3 stars with the original trac 
 This is my first Ludlum book and it is sure to be my last.  The plot is preposterous because of Ludlum's limited understanding of economics and history.  Once you realize that, all interest in the story falls away.  It starts off plausible enough...and the blurbs on the jacket imply some "weapon" more powerful than a mere 270 million dollars!  Hitler gained power because of the alignment of a number of situations that made the ground fertile for his brand of megalomania.  Some spoiled, rich American brat and his fortune would hardly make a difference to the currents of history.  I know that this is only supposed to be a work of fiction, and it is all in good fun, but the plot-concept needs to be much more believable to hold my interest.  If you don't need logic in your fiction, it's interesting enough as a cloak and dagger story, but it falls far short in the historical (and economic) fiction department 
 This book started really strong and started dying about half way through.  The first half flowed pretty nicely, the authors all had very close styles of writing that made it really enjoyable.  About half way through, one of the big characters just disappeared and became a minor one, the styles of writing changed, sex and violence suddenly were added in what seemed like a PG-rated book, and the flow of events suddenly changed and left you confused.  At the end, things seemed to make some sense, but at the same time your thinking "What?" Started strong, ended badly.  Too bad too, I really liked Booger 
 This is my first book by Edmund White and probably my last.  His stories are marginally entertaining & I suppose the they succeed on some level, but they so strewn with French phrases that can only be known by a French  speaker or a Francophile that one begins to wonder who Edmund is trying to  impress?  The same goes for his conquests, always trying to impress with  his prowess and his internationalism.  In short, if you can stomach  pretention at a party you may be able to stomach this.  I can't, there are  too many good things to read 
 I grill year round and in many weather conditions.  Unlike the gold and platinum grills, the silver grill does not have a carry handle to keep it shut for transport (see the review about the burnt down car), nor does it have the ability to prop the lid as a wind/rain shield.  The silver grill works fine in nice weather for fast, hot cooking, but if you want to grill in a drizzle or in a little wind, the ability to prop the lid up (available on the gold and platinum models) is essential.  I lost my gold grill.  Last night I tried cooking in a little rain on the silver grill, and it wasn't up to task like my gold grill was.  I'm going to buy a gold or platinum grill this time 
 The title of this book is unfortunately misleading.  If you believe, as I do, that "Web Services" has something to do with SOAP (or more specifically, nuSOAP or other PHP-specific library) then prepare to be disappointed if you buy this book!  The closest thing you will find is a short discussion of the Amazon API and Google translation services, a slim 24 page chapter out of the entire 400+ page book.  These are both already documented online. The rest is an intermediate-level discussion of common PHP applications, which are addressed as well (if not better) in a number of other books...  Not recommended.      Postscript: Based on the ratings for this review, I felt it necessary to add the following clarifying comments:  This book is a decent introduction to general PHP web programming.  However (and most PHP newbies would not know this), "Web Services" is a VERY specific programming term used to describe some relatively advanced concepts, e.g. Remote Procedure Calls between hardware-agnostic servers.    So what we have here is a book that explicitly claims to provide some specific, advanced programming knowledge.  THE BOOK DOES NOT DELIVER ON THE PROMISE IMPLIED BY ITS TITLE!  No matter how good an introductory book this is, readers should be warned that they will not come away with any increased knowledge of "Web Services".  Caveat Emptor

 The other reviewers are right - this dog of a book should never have been published. In fact it seems to have been published by the author himself by way of a vanity press. Well, he shouldn't have wasted his time or his  money, and I shouldn't have wasted mine. This author knows NOTHING about  philosophy, but that doesn't stop him from complaining REPEATEDLY that  philosophers are a bunch of idiots. If possible, he's even more ignorant  (and prouder of it) than Rand herself 
 This novel was a terrible disappointment for me because I have enjoyed almost all of Elizabeth Berg's previous novels.  This one, however, is so unrealistic, so phony and so easy to see where the story is leading.  An idyllic marriage, a perfect little town, ideal new neighbors and acquaintances,  friends who rush to the aid of the new widow even though she has ignored them for 30 years, and so on.  Too treacly by far! 
 As a serious amateur woodworker who has also studied the design and building of wooden boats, let me say that beechwood is by far one of the inferior materials one could choose for making wooden spoons.  Olivewood is by far the superior material for this sort of common yet critical kitchen tool. Should you doubt this, please visit the kitchens of France, Italy and Spain to see what's stirring the pot.   Additionally, fabricating the spoon by gluing multiple pieces together is a lesson in engineering failure. It violates the most basic principles of woodworking.  Wood, because it is made by nature and not man is not uniform.  Wood not only expands and contracts as it heats and cools, but also as it draws up moisture and dries.  Multiple pieces equals multiple rates of expanding and contracting, working against the glued joint.   While Oxo makes and sells some very fine kitchen tools (I have a vegetable peeler by them that's the best I've ever owned and it's about a decade old), this is sure not among them.  A product to avoid 
 I should have listened to my first instinct not to get this book when I noted a Harvard child psychiatrist wrote it.  But when you're a fan you suspend disbelief in order to hear what other "average Americans" have to say about Springsteen's work.  I agree with one reviewer, Coles book sounds like Cole writing what he thinks common folk think about Springsteen's songs.  Either that or he has worked with the people featured in the book so much, they have taken on his voice.  I finished the book not out of fascination for what the people said (some of their insights and observations had me wondering if they really listened to the music or perhaps took some bad college literature classes), but out of what seemed strange similarities between the interviewees.  They are purportedly from different walks of life and parts of the country, and yet, if you read through, you will find they have similar ways of phrasing ideas, ways of speaking they hold in common (that are not in keeping with how most people speak), and similar rhythms to their speech.  It had the feel of coming from the same Harvard educated author and not interviews of different "common folk".  I'm not going to accuse Coles of fabrication, rather of embellishing the stories (heavily) with his voice and his ideas.  Beyond the question of authenticity, the interpretations and visions of Springsteen's songs in this book are soulless in my opinion.  They do a poor job of exploring the teenage angst of his earlier work, the worker/adulthood angst in later work, and the angst of his favorite topic - societal misfits and deviant's.  When one of the interviewees in the book states that the songs Nebraska and Johnny 99 are trying to get you to feel sorry for the main characters - it goes to show how far off the mark the interviewee and Coles are 
 I actually picked up this book in my church library.  While, I'm wary of christian romances, this one caught my eye.  And I loved it!  Dee Henderson's writing style is fun and her charachters are okay.  She deals much more honestly with the realities of the world then other romance novels.  Having read almost all of her books now though, I have to say that they are dangerous for young women.  Every book is a romance with God playing a distant second to the man and woman who are falling in love.  In all of them that I've read, the formula is exactly the same.  Man or Woman of God meets Woman or Man who is not a Christian with a personal battle to overcome.  Get them together through some sort of danger fall in love.  Even before the non-christian converts though, while the christian is saying that they can't date them, they still kiss and pursue each other.  This teaches young women 1. That it's good to pursue a non-christian-after all maybe you'll convert them. 2. That physical reletionships are okay with non-christians, even if you can't date them. 3. That a non-christian will inevitably fall in love with Jesus if you want them to.  I'm going to ask my church to remove it from our library.  A great alternative is Shaunti Feldhaun's two novels The Veritas Conflict, and the Lights of Tenth Street.      
 Putting aside all the club politics and the way this guy lived his life and chose to leave his club.What it boils down to is this is a book that this biker wrote by himself . Big mistake . All the really good biographys and memoirs I have read by outlaw bikers Like Sonny Barger's book and Chuck Zito's were co-authored by professional writers . Toby Levingston from the east Bay dragons hired the same guys who did Sonny's book to do his and you know what? It turned out to be an entertaining and engaging read. Since Ct. Ed didn't do this this book is pages and pages of droning dialogue which repeats itself and goes on and on. This book should of been edited. It does turn into a celebration of the authors own ego and self-importance. I collect books on Outlaw motorcycles clubs .This one was really lacking and lame. 
 The author speaks of incredible global structures based on "white privilege" and thus reveals his work as complete and total medicine showmanship. This book could have been worthwhile as a laugh, but it is not well written enough and therefore comes across as garbage instead. The author pretends to speak on behalf of all white people, thereby exposing himself as as big of a charlatan as those like Jesse Jackson who claim to be able to speak for all of black people. This book is not even worth the sales tax or the shipping 
 This is an overly simplistic and poorly written introduction to the Arthur legend. If there weren't many better presentations of these tales for young readers, there might be an excuse for such a substandard rendering. Unless you want your kids to think that writing sentence fragments is preferable to constructing clear complex sentences, you might want to stay away from the entire "Bullseye Step Into Classic" series 
 I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the  "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
 Walt Whitman's life's work is his "Leaves of Grass", enlarged over the years with additional poems.  Regarded as America's poet, Whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the "Manifest Destiny" ideology of the pre-war, through the Reconstruction period of US History.    The poems are diverse and upbeat.  The language, for the most part, is clear and easy.  Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines.  Very few poetic devises are used.  One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry.  But, in comparison to rhyhming verse by Longfellow, Frost, Byron, Browning, or Shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.    Although a classic, "Leaves of Grass" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology.  None of his poems are memorable.  Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.  I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.  Whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie, "Dead Poet's Society"; so, the reputation of the work must be quite impressive, though it beats me how that is 
 NOWHERE on the package is it indicated that this products requires a particular type of photo memory card (MS or SD).  It will not operate without it!  On the back of the package it reads "Download photos with USB cable (incl.) or simply insert memory card (MS or SD - not incl.)"  Wording is extremely deceiving and implies that photos can be directly downloaded to the device - they cannot 
 The green and Yellow Cover suggests it's about a not very good football club from England. Chirp Chirp. I couldn't find any football in it at all - this was dosappointing 
 i was forced to read this book by our public schools which are strongly influanced in theocracy i think that this book has too many references to  "THE GREAT LORD" well i think this is wrong and obviously i didnt  enjoy this book it was too boring and really really slow at most parts its  a bunch of short stories which have been writen over a period of time.  Margaret laurence isnt a good writer, i personally think that my review has  more intelect and insight than any one of her novel 
 Based on a storyline from the 1800's, this book, in this day and age, is verging on child pornography, child neglect and promiscuous language.  I can see its value for literary purposes with much expressive language, however, the heroine of this book is 13yrs old at the beginning of the book, is treated as a child throughout, the story advances by just days at a time and yet in the end she marries in the next spring at the age of 13 or 14yrs.  Some of the language used is so 1940's and has developed alternate meanings over the time frame of 60+ years.  Some very good escapist scenes, however, it will be interesting to see what they do to this novel to clean it up for the 21st century movie that is planned. When there are so many other thousands of good storylines to choose from, why did movie makers choose this one 
 First of all, this software performs like someones term project.  Why havent these guys been sued yet? Pros:   Nice retail packaging  Cons:   Not tested Doesnt burn all your files NO support Overall a waste of moner  
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be. They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body. Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first. A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects. Some don't make it out the other side. I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone. Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones. I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too. Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 I was very disappointed in this book, as I expected a book with at least some insights into religion versus science Instead, we are 'treated' to  someone who never found what he wanted to do so became a Jesuit whose main  and only job now at the Vatican seems to be the keeper of meterorites. Much  of the latter part of the book is simply his personal experience in  Antartica or somewhere, totally unrelated to the book's title or presumed  focus (and the reason I bought it. A real waste of time. And the waste of  what was and could have continued to be an important life 
 If you could, that's what I would rate this. It's almost as bad as Kevin Federline's music, which I don't think you can call music either 
 Not Impressed, not even a little bit.  I was so excited when I got this in the mail....BUT, very very disappointed after viewing it. I completely mis-understood the purpose of this DVD.  I thought it was more focused towards teaching Dancehall style moves.  I don't find it the least bit instructional in any way.  It looks like some sort of strange aerobics on the beach.  I can honestly say I have never seen anyone doing any of these dance moves in any of the clubs within 100 miles of where I live (near DC). Most of the dances are shown in 1 or 2 minute clips.  The majority of the DVD is documentary and interviews.  (and kinda hard to understand what they are saying)    Sorry for the bad review, but, I don't want anyone else to have the same fabulous expectation of instruction and then be disappointed by this cheaply made disc. (seriously, it is cheap 
 This is the sort of book you get when an author writes on a subject with which he has only a passing familiarity, and lacks the confidence that the subject matter is inherently interesting enough to hold the reader's attention.  The result is a book that is ultimately unsatisfying.  One symptom of the problems described above is that large portions are devoted to subjects other than money.  For example, the author uses the first three pages after the introduction to describe Aztec ritual sacrifice in literally gory detail before proceeding on to the use of cocao beans as commodity money.  I think that's meant to be what they used to call in show business a "grabber," but for the reader expecting to learn about money, it's a distraction. Another problem is that the author's grasp of modern economics is shaky at best, and especially in the latter part of the book, he'll make a point and then repeat himself, much as an undergraduate trying to extend the length of a term paper that's run a few pages short.  And yet, there's also some interesting and oddly convincing tidbits of information here. The author states that L. Frank Baum's 1900 book "The Wizard of Oz" is really a parable about the need for a bimetallic dollar based on both gold and silver.  But even as it strikes you that this is an interesting bit of trivia, you realize that it's only a bit of trivia and has little larger significance.  If you're looking for a economic history of money, you should look elsewhere.  If you're interested in the cultural and sociological impact of money, this may be more to your liking, though I think it still falls short.    
 This book makes saltwater aquariums seem easier than they actually are. For one, I don't even think the book mentions the use of reverse osmosis or deionized water, which is strongly recommended by all marine aquarists. The author also doesn't mention the importance of live rock. In fact, he goes as far to advise against using live rock for fish-only tanks! Sure, you might be able to get away with not using live rock, but it won't be worth it in the long run. Also, I don't agree with the list of recommended filter combinations. One more thing, the book lists an air stone as essential equipment, but the only thing an air stone will do is aid evaporation and cause salt creep! If you have enough movement of water at the surface, you should get sufficient gas exchange. There is, however, one thing the book does get right: its strong recommendation of using a protein skimmer.  This book is easy to understand, but you won't be getting the best information 
 Update:  I think I've figured out why they've made the changes which take away much of the Magick that is Riverdance.  The people I work with know how crazy I am about all things Celtic.  So, bless 'em, they thought I would like Michael Flatley's latest creation, Celtic Tiger, and got me that for my holiday gift this year.  After watching that HIDEOUSLY TACKY travesty of a show, it seems like whoever is in charge of RD these days is trying to compete with Sacred meets Vegas and Vegas wins junk that Mr. Flatley has produced!  So, come on, take RD back to it's Magickal, Lovely, Sacred Roots!           What are they thinking?  Who changed the number that originally featured Davey Spillane playing the pipes?  Why on Earth would anyone want to take one of the most soul-hauntingly lovely pieces of Sacred Musick ever written amd make subtle alterations to it?  And the sound quality of the tape leaves a lot to be desired!  As always, the performers are AWESOME!  And I've gotten over the trauma of knowing that I'll never get to see Michael and Jean live!  Just kidding about the trauma part, however the RD of my dreams DEFINIETELY has those two in the lead roles!  But come on, a Lugh with black hair!  The best Lugh I've actually seen live was Patrick Roddy.  The best Brigit I've seen live is Eileen Martin.   The last time I saw RD live was about a year ago, and this was the version that I saw and it kind of made me think that RD was trying to go Hollywood!  However, there were a few good things about the changes.  The narration about how it's all a journey from one lifetime to the next and the inclusion of the Shivna number!  It's quite good!  I wouldn't realy advise buying this tape unless you are a RD nut like I am and buy anything about RD that you can get your hands on!   
 I bought this as a textbook for a college course.  While the intro to Mac was helpful, and the author sets up and goes through real-life type projects in a logical manner, the many errors in the book interfere with learning.  For example, the reader is told to press 'm' to access the move tool when pressing 'm' really accesses the marquee tool.  Often when the examples are worked step-by-step they don't look like the finished product as shown in the book, especially when using text.  Overall disappointing.  And I've only gone through the photoshop part so far.  I would have given them 3 stars if there was an errata page online that could help me.  But there's not 
 First of all, shame on the women who gave this book glowing reviews on the first few pages!  I was completely shocked (had to re-read the passages several times) by the authors suggestion that a woman who was sexually approached by a co-worker basicallly overreacted by becoming angry, and that she should have instead interpreted the pass as his awkward attempt to "find some way to connect with her.  Might she have deflected the pass but turned the attempt into something more suitable to a collegial work relationship?"(page126)  Give me a break!  I can't believe that this example of gaining influence over people ever made it past the editor.  And if that wasn't bad enough, they again insulted women on page 226, when they explain that a women ponders her failure in a management role by saying "I still haven't figured out why they allowed a female - especially one without an engineering background - to manage the project".  What?!?  I had to check the front of the book to see if it was published in the 60s!  Besides these profoundly ignorant examples, I found the book to be less than marginal in developing my ability to influence those around me.  I'll look elsewhere 
 I read the reviews before buying this book and understood some of the objections others had.  Having DID, I bought this book with the soul purpose of finding out the process and struggles Oxnam went through in his healing.  I was extremely disappointed. His constant reference about how he spent two years in exhausting therapy sessions three times a week sent a resounding message about his financial status. Most people in therapy can hardly afford to go once a week.  His need to be special and exceptional was evident by his comment that "MPD" was "extremely rare".  This showed a lack of knowledge of Oxnam and his threapist.  The percent of children traumatized before the age of five is staggering.  Current understanding leads experts to believe that DID is more common than they used to think it was.  Oxnam's constant name dropping and many pages of his accomplishments through out the book was boring and served no purpose.  His insistance in calling the disorder MPD instead of DID was an indicator that he was operating from outdated resources and knowledge.  There is a reason the disorder was changed from MPD to DID and in 1990 when Oxnam was diagnosed, the disorder was called DID.  There is a difference in threaputic approaches between MPD and DID.  This insistance by Oxnam and his threapist put doubts on the validity of treatment.  Anyone who has studied DID and has gone through therapy for DID with an experienced therapist will detect that Oxnam's therapist was not experienced in treating DID.  I was left wondering why the therapist did and said what he did. Oxnam's extreme foul language in the book was not congruent with his constant mentioning of his superior intellect.  Upon finishing the book, I still remained uninformed about what Oxnam's real internal struggles were and extremely frustrated over Dr. Smith's methods. The many pages of Dr. Smith's explanation of DID at the end of the book is a futile attempt to convince the reader that he is an expert which he clearly was not at the time he worked with Oxnam for seven years.  In short, the book is about a very spoiled, weatlthy man's frustration over having DID and his insistance that he be pampered through the whole processes. I actually felt sorry for Oxnam that his therapist strung him along, but with Oxnam's constant references to his wealth, vast intellegence and status in life, I didn't feel too sorry. I will donate this book to the library book sale which will sell for 50 cents which is still over priced.   If you really want to read and understand DID, read Dissociative Identity Disorder Source Book.  It still remains the bible of DID for those who really truly suffer from its effects.   
 This is honestly one of the worst films (I use this term loosely) I have ever sat through. A past review said it was good script, I can't believe there was a script. Between all the uh's and um's that come out of the "actors" mouths, one would have to think they were coming up with the dialogue as they went along. This is the unfortunate downside of a time when anyone with a DV recorder and Final Cut can make a movie and put it out. True, it allows many unknown artists the opportunity to realize their vision without the help of some corporate mega-studio giving them the go ahead, but on the other hand, you might end up having to watch something called "Firecracker". Do yourself a favor, stare at a wall for an hour and a half instead 
 I read this book at the local Barnes & Nobles. I thougt I was getting something out of it because the ideas the author was talking about sounds very interesting.  I was greatly disappointed because throughout the entire book, I found no actual example of dialogues, NONE. It's like saying "BE frindly at first every you meet a person" and it does not tell you how to be friendly nor any example of conversation.  Don't waste your money, I recommend this one instead:  Conversationally Speaking : Tested New Ways to Increase Your Personal and Social Effectiveness by Alan Garner  Thanks for readin 
 The book opens with what sounds like a justification as to why Left Hand of Darkness should be considered sci-fi; that it needs justification at all should be considered a huge warning sign. The story can quickly be summarized as follows: an envoy (Genly Ai) for an interplanetary society is sent to negotiate a trade treaty with the nations of the ice planet Gethen. Through the protagonists' travels two nations are examined. The monarchy of Karhiden and Orgoreyn, a totalitarian state. Banished from one and tortured in the other, Genly Ai has to make a dangerous escape through the icy plains before finishing his mission. There is the additional twist that Gethenians are androgynous and only become male or female when they are in heat, two days of each month. However, this theme is not really explored and if Le Guin's characters were simply male and female the story would not see much change. Which begs the question: why introduce that concept in the first place ? The political drama part has a few similarities to Dune on the one hand and 1984 on the other. However, it pales in comparison to either of them. What we are left with then is a vivid description of the arctic landscape, its horrors and its beauty, making the reader shiver as he follows Genly's and his friend's three month journey.  Why has this book won Nebula and Hugo awards ? I have no idea. As a travel report of the arctic in National Geographic magazine it would be excellent, but as a science fiction novel it is quite disappointing 
 alex cross. yes. james patterson. yes. stories about sex, violence, murder, thrill, suspence, money, victems, etc. PLEASE DO NOT INVOLVE PREGNANCY'S AND CHILDREN! this is too much. 
 I tried to embrace this book--I really did. It was tempting to want to have at last found a piece of academic writing that deftly encapsulates and explains this clash of titans: jihad and globalism. Barber's main title is, however, more tantalizing than explanatory. This book demonstrates the dangers of allegiance to dichotomies; there are other forces at work in society that grapple with the headline-stealing titans.  This is an important book at least insofar as it captures a growing sentiment among academics interested in the socio-economic forces that compel current events. It is not, therefore, an easy read for the layman (particularly the last part of the book) which is ironic given his call to grassroots citizen action.   Barber asserts--really insists with an uncomfortable brand of academic arrogance--in almost narrowly political overtones that the world is immersed in a battle of opposing ideologies: the corporate, amoral and homogenized one that really is without ideology and the local, or tribal, and rigidly moral and fragmented one that is part ideology, part myth-making.  Unfortunately, in his earnestness to construct and defend his convenient dichotomy, he conforms exceptions to his rule. The jihadists--whether ethnic hatemongers or terrorists--have for Barber retained some residue of moral dignity while the globalist--whether gullible, materialistic and indifferent consumers or manipulative, multinational executives--have altogether lost their moral compass.  His solution (which he fails to outline, thus making his work more of a polemic and manifesto rather than manual for change) is an activist citizenry fully appreciative of their need and ability to shore up the civil sector of modern societies. Here again Barber is remiss, revealing that writing from one's desk rather than the field has its limitations. He fails to acknowledge, for example, the extent to which the lack of a civic tradition in such nations as Russia and China impedes social progress of the sort he pines for. And the following further indicates his lack of awareness of Chinese cultural resiliency: "What is striking is that even here where a native culture might be thought to have its greatest chances against the children of the Western Enlightenment, McWorld seems irresistible."(190)  Aside from this concern, and his lack of concrete solutions and elusive, often inaccessible writing style, Barber tends to exaggerate the extent to which corporate influence is mitigated by both government and civic organizations, especially in the Western democracies. He is undeservedly far too pessimistic in this regard and fails to note the many ways in which a bygone American lacked a collective sense of civic duty. Moreover, his analysis is flawed, as I believe you will also discover, by his apparent aspirations to global citizenship. Nor, as other reviewers have noted, has he given due credit to the government and business sectors in creating a climate for a civic society to exist, must less flourish with some degree of autonomy. The symbolic assault on McDonald's is both tedious and unfair. While guilty of promoting unhealthy diets to some extent, it is a zealous stretch to accuse this and other multinationals of single handedly distorting the cultural landscape of developing nations. And even in the U.S., McDonald's has played a civic role via the Ronald McDonald House, it's management hiring practices and provisions for inner-city employment.  This book, perhaps like this review, could have been thought out more and condensed considerably. For a far better articulated review of this book see Gary Rosen's piece online from the journal First Things 
 I am one of a growing number that find Larkin lame and flaccid. You read, you understand, you move on. There is little to struggle over, nothing one wishes to reread. Simple poems of a lost England 
 My all time favorite book is Deavers THE BLUE NOWHERE and The Testament by another author.  I think this book is on the bottom of my list.  It was a combo term paper and novel.  I wonder where the editor of this book is.  Where was he/she?  It read like it was written by two different people and a poor editor combined them.    Don't worry Jeff, I'll still buy your next book...I've bought them all but please ...get a second opinion about your editor. I good editor wouldn't have let it go out in this shape. 
 This movie is the story of a gay Cuban writer who eventually makes it to the U.S. to escape the persecution he's suffered in Cuba. And that's about all that can be inferred from this movie. There are large chunks that are spoken in a different language. But there are no English subtitles so you have no idea at all what's going on. This disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all. Whatever the message of this movie is, whatever it's trying to convey, it's lost in the plotless story 
 My hsuband and and decided that I would nurse Hailey her entire first year.  I work at a school and was able to pump twice a day.  I didn't like doing it in school though because there wasn't space for it.  SO I would go in my car and do it.  All I had a first was the battery pack.  I would go through 10 batteries a week and half way through the week I would loose strength/suction.  Once I got the adapter I never had a problem again.  We could go anywhere and I would always have access to power Including when we drove from VA to GA.  My husband would drive and I would pump.  It is great.. 
 I found Mitchell's topic very interesting and approached the books with a lot of enthusiasm.  However, in the end I found Mitchell's description disappointing.  While he does note a few concrete changes he expects to come about in the urban landscape (e.g. buildings being less clearly distinguished in terms of the kinds of activities they contain, and perhaps a shift in the importance of the urban center as digital connectivity diminishes the emphasis on physical location) that were good starting points for a consideration of architecture in the digital age, the bulk of this book was characterized by repetitive speculation about the changes associated with the digital age (accounts that may have made more of an impact on his readers in 1995 when the book was first published, but today seem rather obvious or exagerated and tiresome to read) without really relating them to architecture in an insightful way.  Mitchell's vague and speculative language distracted me from the few interesting points that he did make. Interesting topic, but Mitchell's treatment of it was not particularly satisfying.  
 I'm surprised no other reviewer noticed! Why did Penquin place Ronald Colman and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. prominently on the cover? In this reviewer's opinion, they must secretly realize that the wonderful 1937 classic film vastly outshines the printed word. I found the  story to be poorly written and hard to follow. Its' style is too formal, too flowery and too wordy!	If I had not seen (both) versions of the film, I could not have followed the "action". I constantly referred back to mental images of the movie to orientate myself. A review of "PZ" boils down to a basic truth: While most agree that the book is usually superior, occasionally the movie wins out. "PZ" is a prime example. ("Strangers on a Train" is another!). As for the so -called sequel, "Rupert of Hentzau"- don't even bother, unless you are an Anthony Hope fanatic. Reviewing the book makes one appreciate-once again- that wonderful film fadeout as Ronald Colman rides off over the hill. Since it happens to be available on amazon, click on the movie reviews. Therein will lie the essence of the wonderful adventure story of "The Prisoner of Zenda" 
 I bought the DVD with this artwork out of a dollar bin and I got what I paid for. The image is fuzzy and the audio is of poor quality. This must have been taken from a 16mm print. It may be that this film is in public domain, so it may be difficult to find a decent quality DVD. There are many issues of this film so you would do better to try one of the other DVD issues. Note: Amazon seems to spread these reviews across DVDs of the same title, so you may see this review under multiple DVD releases of "Meet John Doe".  The poor quality DVD that I bought has a cover that looked like this: [... 
 We read this book in ILA and it was so boring! The character had no emotions and it was very slow moving with no excitement. I almost fell asleep. DON'T READ THIS BOO 
 The book is a hateful diatrabe against Christians.  The book is allegedly about Hume, Newton and their relation to the Design argument.    The book attacks Newton as progenitor of the design argument and then denies Newton was progenitor of the design argument.  The book claims Paley and others gave us the design argument and that Newton was under pressure to insert the argument in his General Scholium.  Then the book says that Hume's arguments were really directed against Plato, Aristotle, Stoicists and Philo.  So why does he bother talking about Paley, Newton and so on if Hume was arguing against someone else?  The book ends up falling on conclusory statements of Darwin's natural selection fantasy in order to dispense with the design argument even though the main thesis is Hume's dialogues concerning natural religion, which predated Darwin by several hundred years.    On page 173, the author dispenses with Paley's argument from the eye to divine design.  The author claims, without any argument, that Paley's argument was illegitimate.  However, Darwin didn't think so.  Darwin wrote on page 75 of "the Origin of the Species" that "To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree."  Therefore, Hurlbutt's god Darwin didn't approve of Hurlbutt's criticism of Paley.  The author writes like he's grinding his teeth in irrational anger.  His book boils down to ad hominem arguments.  For example, when talking about scientific style, page 26, he says "the coat is mathematical and the pants empirical.  The underwear is religious and old-fashioned."  On page 169, he quotes Abrose Bierce as follows: "Ocean, n. A body of water occupying about two-thirds of a world made for man -- who has no gills."    Hurlbutt is very inconsistent.  Hurlbutt denies there is such thing as morality and then argues that there cannot be a God with so much immorality in the world.  Hurlbutt eventuallly abandons all of his posturing himself as a man of reason when he concludes at the end of his book, page 196, that "Life is full of absurdity, is irrational, is inexplicable, is unexplainable, is incongruous, is meaningless."  Then why is he arguing that he's a man of reason if reason can't get you anywhere?  Even evolutin can't explain what is inexplicable.  He spent the last few hundred pages saying Christians are irrational.  If so, why doesn't he join their camp?  Too late for him now, though.  Now that he's in hell, he can argue with Hume, Darwin and Bierce about how wrong they are 
 I admittedly have not completed the full book, as it is thick.  However I do find that the narrative focuses on the reactive rather than the proactive tools needed for DFSS.  For example almost all the examples given in section 2 talk about an existing system or process and there doesn't seem to be any design examples and how the stats are used to solve the design problems.  I therefore think the book is more about Six Sigma than DFSS.  Barry 
 This is simply a disjointed journal of a series of short hikes with portions deteriorating to a lame account of car camping. This ranks as one of the worst books ever published. Don't waste your time 
 This is the first (and last) book by David Baldacci that I've ever read. He is one of the worst best-selling writers I've ever read. He writes almost every sentence of dialog in the form of a Tom Swifty sentence ("We've got to get out of here," said King, menacingly). His flair for melodramatic overstatement is second to none. The actions of the characters make no sense at all. For example, when Michelle sees a laser from a gun sight pointed at the chest of her trusty sidekick, Sean King, she says, "Sean, don't move!" instead of "Sean, dive for cover!!!" Bottom line - save your money and buy something worthwhile 
 This magazine used to be very thorough, and it used to be very good at providing me with TONS of deals and tips that I never would have found on my own. It was great, and very opinionated. But last year sometime, they changed the look of it and now there's a lot less text. It's much more a style magazine now, and that's not what I want in a travel magazine that I have bought to tell me about money saving! Worse, except for the 40 Best Vacation Bargains, which are still okay, most of the articles forget to incluce a lot of money-saving tips and instead they too often suggest I do expensive things. Since when is a $225 a night hotel considered budget?? The headlines and captions are expecially smart-aalecky.  It's not as good with the expert advice as it used to be! I noticed that Arthur Frommer isn't editing it anymore which maybe is why--bring him back! My search for a true money-saving travel magazine has unfortunately resumed again 
 I saw a small write-up about this book in the newspaper. Intrigued by the title and encouraged by the review, I bought the book. I read through it despite not really enjoying it overall. It seemed real repetitive, unorganized and more or less, it is just a collection of metaphors with a little bit of narrative added to it. While it is a good basic book that you can reference if you are ever in need of a metaphor, if you are looking for a little more strategic use of language this is not it 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 If you're looking for a "what's new in SQL Server 2005" this book covers that.  If you're looking for a reference book on the product, that goes into how to configure or upgrade from an earlier version--Keep Looking.  The book explains new features in some detail.  But, I want to know how to place the databases in a specific directory, how to set up replication--not mirroring; and how to install the software remotely.  The book does not discuss any of that 
 It is conventional wisdom that good books are written by good writers, and that understanding of the subject is of secondary importance.  This book is a disproof of that conventional wisdom.  Mr. Olson is a fine writer, but he is not a scientist.  Within the first 50 pages he has spent 2 pages on an incorrect explanation of an important genetic concept.   Give me instead the real McCoy: Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza is a scientist with true insight.  His book, "Genes, Peoples, and Languages" is beautifully inspired.  He truly understands what he is writing about; and the most interesting elements of Mr. Olson's book are better handled in (if not derived from) Dr. Cavalli-Sforza's book.  Mr. Olson, by contrast, is a layman who doesn't quite comprehend that about which he writes.  He is the blind leading the blind; and most of his readers don't know the difference, apparently including  the nominating committee for the National Book Award.  
 As a fan of Indian fiction I was really excited to read this novel.  I had read a glowing review on it and put my name on the local library list for it. Boy was I disappointed! The writing was overly simple and dull.  Ramchand, the main character, elicited no sympathy from me.  I never felt like the author adequately explained the inner turmoil that was so central to his character. Overall I found the book depressing 
 I bought this toy as a xmas present for my daughter. It lasted six days! It will randomly stop playing her cds after a certain amount of seconds. It was her favorite part of the radio and now she can't even use it! 
 I've had the opportunity to watch the movie Stealth over the past week.  It was on TV here. Otherwise, I don't think I would have watched it.  My instincts would have been correct.  An action technothriller, Stealth has a predictable plot. A new elite team of 3 good-looking pilots gets a new wingman on their first mission in the field: an artificially intelligent stealth aircraft which picks up the bad habits of the 3 pilots, including a disrespect for authority. Mayhem ensues. People die. The leaqd pilot develops a relationship with the artificial intelligence, and they work together to save the female pilot, who's gone down in North Korea.  The plot, direction, and acting combine together to produce performances from the 3 leads (Josh Lucas, Jessica Biel, Jamie Foxx) that are about as wooden as their electronic counterpart.  I'm sure that people went to see this because of the 3 beautiful leads, and came away disappointed. Me? I was expecting little, so I guess my expectations were met.  Though I will say I was amused by the last line 
 I have been a Toad fan from day one. I own and can not stop listening to albums from Toad, Glen, Lapdog and Nickel Creek but this ablum sucks. It is so bad that I almost emailed Glen to ask for a refund. Windmills is a great example. MAS takes a great pop/rock song and destoys by trying to turn it into a folk song being played by a bluegrass band. That the problem with this album it doesn't know what it want to be 
 If you want info on what to do with toilet paper rolls or empty plastic bottles and food trays then this book has good info.  However, if you are looking for crafts that you would be proud to give as lasting gifts buy  another book. Also I found that unless you have a large supply of craft  materials like paints, glues, fabrics, etc., you will need to spend a lot  of money to finish most projects. Defeats the trash to treasure premise.  The furniture section is not much better. I garnered more information  watching the home and garden television shows. I am very disappointed this  book does not provide information on gifts I would be PROUD to give this  Christmas. This was a waste of money for me 
 Gary Zukav states in his introduction "I had never studied physics. In fact I didn't like science and I had no mathematical aptitude.  On Opra (TV) he admitted that he does not have a TV which may explain his lack of contemporary physics let alone any depth.  I noticed that some reviewers refer to the "New Physics" is that like "New Age" or voodoo physics?   90% of the matter must be missing from this book. Or else how can he take physics out of context and make such fantastic leaps to religions parallels that he knows little of. He even twists the religion around to serve some unknown purpose.   Many people say they did not understand physics until this book; Surprises, you still do not. You now know what Zukav wished physics was. Take anti-mater for instants that does not mean the opposite of mater. And the relationship between particles has no correlation with the relationship of dogs and cats.  At least get it straight before mixing it up. Try reading some of these: "The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski". The book available everywhere the DVD's available from the UK.  "The Upanishads" by Eknath Easwaran (Editor), Michael N. Nagler (Photographer)  Or just about any mainstream material on physics and religion.  Then if you still want to mix worlds into one read someone saner: "The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism" by Fritjof Capra.  Also on the fringe but not as radical as Zukav is a series called "What the Bleep." (both in books and on video) 
 I was taught to read this way. It was very detrimental to my later emotional, social and even intellectual development. You are not giving your children an edge up by teaching them to read too early. I feel very strongly that this is a very bad idea.  Let them be children. Read to them, and if they pick it up early without flashcards, great, but if you just read to them enough they will become good readers when it's time. Please. Don't do this to your kids. 
 It's very cute, but it didn't work - you'd wind it up and it would just sit there, not moving, despite all sorts of prodding. I opened it up and managed to pry a metal coil away from the plastic casing, against which it seemed to be rubbing. It worked for a couple of weeks after that, but eventually went back to not working. Too bad.. 
 What am I going to do??? I have book group in less than two hours and I HATED this book.  I can't for the life of me figure out why it was selected.  We have never read things like this boring "feminist" diatribe before.  The writing is excruciatingly amateur.  The premise is absurd.  I couldn't figure out why any news agency would report on a bunch of women walking down a rural road in Wisconsin as newsworthy.  I have many really good women friends, but the male bashing really bothered me.  Yes, there were some men in the book who were portrayed as nice, even noble, but the women-as-victim-becoming- empowered theme was quite frankly overwrought and silly.  I was struck by the lesbian overtones in the book and the amount of references to alcohol.  I am not a teetotaler, I like to drink, but the whole thing was absolutely  booze soaked - even the pregnant woman drank like a fish! I could not recommend this book to anyone. As another reviewer on this site stated - if you want to read good literature about women and mothers and friendship, please read Ann Tyler, Annie LaMott, Amy Tan, Margaret Atwood, and any number of other much better writers.  
 I gagged my way through The Notebook but thought I would give Nicholas Sparks another try.  I read about 1/3 of the book and decided it was a waste of my time.  
 This book is dense and filled with all sorts of self-important and sometimes useful information, but the overall tone made me consider writing a nasty letter to the author. Unfortunately, there is no one distinct chapter entitled "You Probably Will Never Make It As A Director So Get Used to The Idea of Editor, Writer, or Gaffer," so you never know when some discouraging, negative, excitment-crushing comment will pop up. This book is not simply realistic in alerting the reader to the idea that the industry is a tough market, it makes directing sound impossible and you a giant fool for expecting to break into it. How about a little encouragement, Rabiger? Just because you didn't become a famous director yourself doesn't mean there aren't some talented future directors out there currently disguised as innocent victims of your wretched book 
 Typical of a Ripley's Beleive It Or Not book, there are no refrences.  It is a collection of cute trivia from the older Ripley's Believe It Or Not books.  Problem is, most of what can be checked, is wrong.  Frank Wells was never on the Titanic nor the other ship disasters claimed.  The section on laws includes myths and jokes that someone believed.  Stories from older Ripley books are re-told with different names.  It even says "Mushrooms are a fruit." (They are actually fungi. 
 After reviewing all the choices in this category, I purchased this book because the description promised solutions to e-mail overload. As a busy entrepreneur running a 10-person team from a home office, e-mail is a very big part of my workday. I was looking for solid strategies to help me use this tool more efficiently and effectively. Instead, I got an eye-glazing management analysis, pitifully short on solutions. Directed at managers and employees of large corporations, the book is all but useless for anyone else. The so-called solutions were just short of insulting. A few standout examples: "Don't send unnecessary e-mails"; "Don't read every e-mail you get"; "Pick up the phone instead of sending an e-mail." Ya think? Maybe there really is no solution, but after slogging through 189 b-o-r-i-n-g pages, it would have been nice to come away with ONE solid suggestion that could be implemented. I can't say I got even that 
 I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up...... 
 One of my high school students absolutely insisted that I read this book, so after some feeble attempts at making excuses, I agreed to do it.  Because I didn't want to disappoint the boy, I finished the whole book, but if I hadn't promised to read it, I would have put it down about halfway through.  The plot is trite and predictable, but it takes the author forever to get to the predicted point.  (If you're going to write a trilogy, I guess you need a lot of filler.)  The pacing was horribly uneven, the characters are annoying, and the "Kyralian" and "Elyne" words for things we don't have in our world are just plain silly.  There is a glossary in the back of the book if you can't figure out from context what "bol" and "sumi" are.   The magicians don't seem able to DO anything with their magic except create force-fields and communicate telepathically with each other.  Perhaps this book is really an allegory about classism and talent in a stratified society, or maybe it's just another sophomoric, second-rate fantasy novel.  Don't waste your time with it.  Reread Tolkien.    
 I can't believe rubbish like this goes platinum. Rap today with a few exceptions is a joke. People like Chingy, Nelly, Ludacris, Ja Rule, Lil Jon and any other idiot with Lil in their name are ruining rap and making it look like a joke. What is really getting me angry is how so many people don't give any respect to real rap legends like Tupac and Biggie, and give tons of respect to all these clowns. People are thinking this is the sort of stuff rap fans listen to. All these people talk about is money, bling bling and sex. Rap used to be about the streets now its just all i've got so much money and stuff. If you want a real rap CD then get one of the following. NWA - Straight Outta Compton Ice Cube - Amerikka's Most Wanted Dr Dre - The Chronic Snoop Doggy Dogg - Doggystyle Nas - Illmatic Tha Dogg Pound - Dogg Food Tupac - Me Against The World Tupac - All Eyez On me Tupac - Greatest Hits 50 Cent - Power Of The Dollar Biggie - Life After Death You get the picture 
 The decline of Christianity!  Right.  There aren't too many Christians around anymore.  Besides that obvious, astonishing oversight, I expected worse in regards to a biased perspective Crusades, and was appeased at the author's acknowledgement of the silmultaneous atrocities of Islam.  While attempting Biblical higher criticism assumes massive arrogance on the part of the critic, Johnson remains as balanced as one could expect.  But in the last analysis, Christianity is a lot more than a history, and claiming to be able to explain Christianity as a historical specimen assumes both monstrous egotism and unimaginable naivete 
 I had read this one before I read the author's book on Iraq and it is the best of the two, but still I felt the author was giving out second hand information.  She lived so briefly in the kingdom and did not even live in a native setting, so I do not believe she is a person who needs to be writing about the Saudis.  She is assuming to be an expert when in reality, that is rather a joke.  I think of this book as giving me a chance to be an outsider peeking in, for about five minutes.  There are plenty of good books out there on the Middle East, but unfortunately, none are written by this author.  She should find a new career 
  It seems to me that there is FAR too little focas on the entireity of those who suffer from eatig disorders and self injurous behavior. I do mean suffer, because there is more to the whole picture than hurting themselves.  It is very frustrating being a male who suffers from and seeks treatment for both eating disorders and self injurous behaviors,  seeing the myriad of the same stuff written up over and over by different people. Some of them have good things to say, the voice of experience in some cases; and there are many many more that works which are written for the sake of writting alone, or maybe their intentions are vaild, in wishing to further the public acknowledgement/awareness of such disorders.  It is mildly vexing to read the summaries of books on ED and SI [Eating Disorder(s) and Self Injury respectively]and find that evry single title ive seen to date has been about young women. it IS true, sadly, that 2% of american women suffer from ED and/or SI while less than .02% of american men suffer from either, let alone both. Still, i think it is something that almost requires at the very least MORE attention.   That said, it is borderline offensive to read of these perfect people leading perfect lives and for whom either SI or ED or both have a minute if even quantifiable rule on even the most menial of day to day events. i cannot stress enough how large an impact such disorders have in one's own life, as wel as those around you.  Most anything that perpetuates in anything but a negative light, the stereotypes causes problems. real and tangible problems. it unermines the legitimacy of those who knowingly or otherwise conform to said stereotypes, and additionally it creates a general callousness by means of saturation, on the part of the genral public, toward those who do suffer; creating a sort of "they dont deserve help 'cause they started because of a book/tv show/movie" mentality.  On a more vitriolic note: nobody has business writting about or speaking with authority on any first-hand subject material, without having been there first hand to know whats going on where others cannot see. doing so is much much more damaging to the uninitiated getting a fair picture of a given situation than any out negative publicity because 'the most dangerous enemy may well be a trusted friend uninformed' 
 There is no question that this book is the product of an unbounded thinker of possibilities. Lee Smolin's opening description of the history and current state of theoretical physics is highly understandable and makes a  more compelling (albeit unconscious) argument for Intelligent Design theory  rather than his one of "Cosmic Natural Selection." What is interesting is  professor Smolin's rejection a priori of any answer lying outside the realm  of human observation.  He then summarily proposes to describe our universe  as "naturally selected" to maximize the quantity of black holes; they of  course being the "wombs" of new universes with their own black holes, etc.   I have to ask, "Why must they create universes; why not leprechauns or  fairies, for both of which we have minimally far more observational  testimony"?  To quote Davies & Brown from their "Ghost in the  Atom", the many-worlds interpretation "introduces a preposterous amount of  `excess metaphysical baggage' into our description of the physical world."   Rudolph Peierls, formerly at Oxford, dismisses such a theory with a simple  question: "Since we have no means of seeing or ever communication with the  other universes, why invent them?" It is easily more probable to believe  that 10 space/time dimensions really do coexist than to buy into a theory  composed of: an infinite number of ever expanding (non-colliding?)  universes, created by some unknown mechanism, in some unknown space, for  some unknown reason. Who says faith is outside the realm of science? If a  new theory is truly needed now, this seems an unlikely candidate 
 I love this band and have all the rest of their cds 
 Do some research about Wilson. Find his website and listen to his sermons about family. Hear what he says about returning to the Old Testament tribal system. Find what he has said about slavery in the Old South. Think about what his 'learning' has done for him. This guy is nuttier than Lyndon LaRouche, yet he impresses the rubes with a little Latin and a bit of formal logic. "Classical Christian" education as described by Wilson and the Bluedorns is neither 
 I was looking forward to reading this book on what I thought would be a keen insider's look at the Cuban missile crisis, and was somewhat disappointed.  I realize that RFK was not able to complete the text, and perhaps that is reflected in it's length (100 pages of narrative).  A large part of the printed material, about 1/3, is made up of supporting documents.  I had hoped for more detail about the minute-to-minute events of those 13 days.  The strength of the book is its undeniably interesting topic and author.  There was insight to the crisis that I had not previously known, and reading it here was interesting and informative.  For a mid-1900's buff, this might be one piece of a collection and its uniqueness may prove worthwhile.  This is the first book I read on the Cuban missile crisis, and I am left wanting a lot more 
 My 4-year-old son LOVED The Berenstain Bears' New Baby and it was a big help in preparing for the arrival of his baby sister.  So when we were struggling with remembering manners, I bought this book, certain that it would help.  However, I ended up disagreeing with the approach to correcting bad or forgotten manners and rude behavior.  This book outlined specific chores as punishments for various offenses. As parents, we have learned that allowing children to help around the house with things like sweeping, taking out the garbage, and helping Mommy empty the dishwasher (the plastic stuff!) is very empowering and makes kids feel like they can contribute to the household and they enjoy being part of the "family team" (hopefully this will continue into their teens since we've started them as toddlers!).   Also, I learned that I should probably read through any new book by myself at least once before sitting down to read it to my children (parents can learn too!).  Just a thought 
 I guess I'm spoiled by the I Spy games I've purchased for my children. This game has an enormous amount of "story"...it's almost as bad as sitting your child in front of the television. Interaction is confusing and frustrating. I'd rate this lower but it's clear that a lot of work went into the animation, which is top notch. I just wouldn't classify this as a learning game. 
 This product was purchased as a Christmas gift for my father, unfortunately it did not perform for him. I was replacing this with one that he has had for over 10 years and that one still works and outperfomed this brand new model. I am not sure if we just got a defective one but i dont recommend purchasing although i have to say returning to amazon was straightforward they just simply refunded my money, I will inturn buy my dad something else from amazon you just cant beat the service

 I had to use this book for cryptography class, and would not recommend it to anyone.  The book was very math intensive, which I wouldn't mind if it weren't for the fact that there are no explanations in plain english to follow the math.  This book is basically just a bunch of theorems and proofs.  Also, there is no cryptanalysis of any of the algorithms included.  There are much better books out there, I don't know why anyone would want to get this one 
 I loved the original book "The Sherbrooke Bride".  I have read all of the bride books and this is by far the worse.  The only reason I have given this book two stars is because it lets us know what has become of our favorite characters.  Otherwise, this book is a complete waste of time.  If you want to be thoroughly entertained I suggest reading the first book which happens to be about Alex and Douglass.  Skip the second for Ryder's story is so-so.  I would then read Sinjun's search for love.  It is very funny and captivating.  Ms. Coulter generally writes really good books.  She should have quit while she was ahead 
 In recent years, a lot of rubbish has been written attempting to link Jesus to the Essenes.  This book is a prime example of that rubbish.  Efforts to link Jesus to the Essenes are almost entirely based upon speculation and wishful thinking.  Not only do these books create unsubstantiated links between Jesus and the Essenes, they present a false, New Age caricature of the Essenes themselves.  The Essenes were a strict, ascetic Jewish cult, steeped in the Old Testament and their own apocalyptic, sectarian writings.  Few, if any, modern people could reasonably expect to identify sympathetically with their worldview.  But, yes, it's POSSIBLE that Jesus may have had contact with the Essenes, and may have drawn some of his followers from that group;  he may even have lived with the Essenes for some time.  But there is no firm evidence to support any of these claims.  Legitimate authorities such as the Benedictine archaelogist Bargil Pixner have speculated that Jesus had contact with urban Essenes living in Jerusalem, and these Essenes may have provided him with the room for the Last Supper.  Speculation is fine, even necessary, not to mention fun;  but we must not confuse speculation with fact.   
 A ghastly book by the sadly misnamed Sarah Smiley. I have a weakness for domestic memoirs (Jean Kerr, Shirley Jackson, Erma Bombeck) and I am, myself, a military wife, so I was excited to find this book and fully expected to enjoy it.  I hated it. A lot. With the exception of books about serial killers, I don't believe I've ever read a book with a protagonist I liked less. 260 pages of whining. No empathy for anyone: poor Sarah always has it worse. Her mother (an admiral's wife) comments that deployments used to be worse back in the days before email. No, says Sarah, email is worse because there is more disappointed anticipation. ?!?   A friend suffers a miscarriage and Sarah has to be literally shamed into going to help her (Sarah doesn't like blood, you see). Nowhere in the remainder of the book is there an inkling of sympathy for this woman (also a military wife) who has had three miscarriages, the last one while her husband was deployed. It's all about Sarah (who has to babysit for the woman's older child).  Another friend's husband is sent home from the deployment and their family must relocate to California (from Florida) in a month. The reasons for this are not specified, but I can tell you that an officer isn't usually sent home early from a deployment for good behavior. Sarah's response? First, jealousy that her friend's husband is coming home; second, discontent that she (Sarah) will be losing her friend!  The worst, though, is her treatment of her husband, whom she is mad at throughout the entire book. To use one example only: Sarah's husband sends her an email -- one that would have broken my heart had my husband sent it to me -- in which he writes sadly that he will miss seeing their new baby's first smile, just as he missed seeing their older son's. Sarah's response to this? To be angry because that was the only email he sent her that day.   I finished the book only because I was hoping she would grow up! Nope, though. She was just as self-absorbed and whiney on the last page as she had been on the first. I came to Amazon and read the reviews and found several people who said something like "I don't know anything about the military, but now I have an understanding of what military wives go through." I hate the idea that people will read this tripe and think it is in any way representative of me, or of any of the fine military spouses I have known!  And this was a memoir! I can't imagine writing a book in which I acted like a spoiled brat from page 1 to page 260 and allowing it to be published with my picture on the front! Of course, Sarah doesn't think she is a spoiled brat -- oh no! Sarah pees champagne and poops gold bricks and is the white-hot center of the universe...  Once I finished it I threw the thing in the garbage. Yep, the garbage. Usually I donate books I don't want anymore to the library, but that didn't seem final enough in this case. So it's on its way to the York County Waste Treatment Facility right now. And I'm not a bit sorry! 
 So you pick up this book and read on the back cover the exciting quote about Hemingway's ghost and you're ready to drop some cash, right?  Guess what--there's zero information about the Hemingway haunting in this book!  In addition, old Ataulfo of Madrid has less words wasted on him than an asthmatic's version of Handel's Halleluja Chorus.  Instead, what's offered here is a rehash of old stories (and old theories about what ghosts could be) with insipid, comic book illustrations.  Why this is called a "field guide" with its connotation of an exhaustive reference to every kind of manifestation of a particular phenomenon--be it birds, plants, or mushrooms--is yet another part of the mystery of why this book exists.  If you're a serious researcher of this subject, then pass this book up and seek Hem's fetch elsewhere 
 I was very disappointed to discover that this book had a homosexual character. This is absolutely inappropriate for a young adult book, and unless a parent has read the reviews that mention it, said parent would have no clue as it sure isn't mentioned anywhere on the blurb in the book.  I usually am more aware of what my daughter is reading, but this time this particular book slipped under my radar.  She told me that it had a reference to a gay character, which I took to mean just a passing reference, but when I read the book, it was treated more seriously than I thought, even going so far as to have the two girls kiss.  It is inexcusable, both on Ms Pierce's part and on Scholastic's.  No matter what the author's personal beliefs, it is irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to parents. I believe that as a parent, I'm the one responsible for what my children see and do, but it sure helps to have some type of information so I can make an informed decision.  Anise Hollingshea 
 I have been very disappointed by these speakers. I have the series III ones. While the treble sounds fine, perfectly clear...this system has NO BASS! My husband recently bought a $35 set of 2 computer speakers and subwoofer and his setup sounds 10x better than mine!   Because the subwoofer feeds power off the stereo/reciever it's hooked up to, and does NOT have its own direct power supply or amplifier, it literally lacks power. This subwoofer is the biggest joke ever! I can barely hear the bass on most things, even with the volume cranked up.  Bose products are extremely overrated and overpriced. Do not waste your money -- buy something worthwhile (for a fraction of the price!), and make sure the subwoofer has its own amplifier/direct line to outlet 
 Never got to wear this Lingerie at all.  Mailed item back for exchange due to a wrong size recieved but no one got back. Sent several emails to check on item for exchange but in the end got a reply saying that they will credit the amount back to my credit card.  Sent another email to emphasise that I requested for an exchange instead of refund but no one got back...  Very Very bad servic 
 The movie has great sets, and is kind of a mix between matrix and blade runner. However the acting is unconvincing, the big secret is revealed at the beginning, and the character development is weak 
 This CD has the right titles, however the orchestration and the back-up are absolutely atrocious. Also at times Humperdink sounds like Willy Nelson, there is none of that warm vibration that you would expect. The collection of songs is good, some of the execution is decent, but the overall quality of the recording is absolutely below par. Buy Humperdink, but not this production 
 I confess.  I only read the excerpts.  Well, not all of it, my stomach wasn't up to it.  I can't speak to plot (although I have dark suspicions), but the writing style is so bad that I would be ashamed of it if I had written it, and I'm not a published author.  I know I sound like a literary snob, but honestly, I'm not.  I mostly read science fiction, a genre not exactly known for its great literary merit (though I think people do undersell that aspect of it).  The book -- make that the excerpts, suffer from three serious flaws.  The first is the sheer quantity of "saidisms."  Saidisms (prounounced said-is-emss) are modifying the word said.  "she said, grumpily" or "he said, honestly" or "she said, wearily."  Saidisms have two problems.  In the first place, they make the prose clunky.  In something like Buffy, the prose should be snappy, quick and funny.  You can't get that effect if every sentence contains a saidism, it slows down the dialolg.  The other problem is that is insults the reader -- or demonstrates a lack of skill on the part of the writer.  In almost every case, the reader should know how the speaker is speaking.  If a character is grumpy, it's really not necessary to say, "she said, grumpily."  There are rare cases where saidisms are useful, but just look at the sheer number of them in the Sunnydale section.    As long as we're dialog, allow me to mention the second issue which is just wrong.  The writer does not have the characters voices.  We know and love these characters, and one of the characteristics we know and treasure is their unique "voice," the way in which they speak.  In a Buffy episode, you could read a script without attributions, and be able to pick out which characters speak which lines.  One of the extras on the DVDs has an author talking about this issue of unique voices.  She had a line that she'd written for Willow, which she rewrote to give to Xander because she thought that Xander didn't have enough to do.  When Joss saw he script. he pointed to that line and asked her if that line hadn't originally been for Willow.  They put it back in Willow's lines.  The third problem is manifests is  tthat the author has no gift for exposition.  Exposition is explaining the back story, explaining the things that the characters already know but that the audience doesn't.  Exposition is really hard.  One of BtVS exceptional strengths, in fact, is the grace and economy with which they work exposition into episodes.  Without ever feeling like you've been lectured, whole worlds have been laid out for you, credible and interesting, and you never get bored.  That whole Whitechapel beginning is a vast lump of exposition that is indigestible.  There's no story for what seems like forever.  Buffy episodes don't start slow, they start with action and move fast.  Large expositional lumps are exactly contrary to the style of BtVS.  Even if it weren't, large expositional lumps are still a bad idea.  They encourage the reader to put down the book.  How many times do you really want Lonodon fog to be described?  How necessary is it to describe the poverty of Whitechapel?  At minimum, exposition should move the story forward, not cause it to break suddenly to clue you into something.  in the end, I want to justify reviewing a  book based on excerpts.  The flaws I saw in the excerpts are so identifiable, and so basic, that it makes me want to stay a mile away.   At best, this is extremely amateur prose.  The plot might be very good, but the effort of reading that prose makes even the most brilliant plot uninteresting 
 I didn't find the stories as naughty as it states.  They were rather boring 
 Item ordered on September 4th!!!!!  After much delay, I was notified that it would be shipped on Oct 12th. It's now OCTOBER 20TH!!!!!!!!  Now the estimated shipping date is November!!!  Are they kidding!!!!! It is still listed as IN STOCK  on the Amazon website.  WORST ON LINE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!! 
 I'm trying to figure out what movie these other reviewers were watching. I wasted my money so you won't waste yours. It was so boring, I skipped through most of it and deleted it 1/2 way through 
 I have to admit I'm disappointed in this title.  I was hoping to get acquainted with the more complex capabilities of this software, but the book doesn't go any further than the free download help files from Nero.  The Nero Vision (DVD video burning) material amounts to a little over a dozen pages, with most of the space taken up with screen shots - not really that useful, or, at least, not worth laying out the money for a book.  Even the part of "trimming" a video file was wrong based on what I found by trial and error using the real product.  If I had it to do over, I'd save my money and pass on this title. 
 THIS GAME IS EDUCATIONAL BECAUSE U R ASKING QUESTION`S TO OTHER PEOPLEAND IF THIER WRONG THEY HEAR THE ANWSER ANYWAY SO I THINK U SHOULD BUY THIS GAME BECAUSE IT WILL TEACH UR KIDS ALOT.I WISH ALL U PARENTS AND CHILDREN GOOD LUCK 
 The book is poorly organized and sentences are poor written.  It's way too hard to read and understand the point the authors are trying to make.  A lot of run-on sentences, which creates a lot of confusion.  The only good thing is the examples given in the book.  The price is WAY TOO HIGH 
 I didn't like this book.  It's about giving zero tolerance to children's rudeness.  The authors are convinced that there way is right.  It is authoritarian style parenting. It's supposed to be about logical consequences but the consequences are not logical just punishing. They don't recommend, they tell you what you must do. They say that not taking your child to a concert where people are relying on him to perform is how to deal with rudeness and teach him/her how to be respectful of other people!!!  Parent's need to see the bigger picture and deal with the situation which includes the child's rudeness and not focus solely on that.  
 This book has many characteristics that I really dislike to see in a textbook.    First, the authors flooded almost every page with extraneous information.  When you're learning this stuff, you want it to be explained simply and clearly - but the authors seem more intent on showing you how much they know about some topic, even when that information is tangenital and not very helpful.     They don't word things clearly.  They'll call the same thing by two different names - (i.e. "Pension Cost" and "Pension Expense") which needlessly adds to the confusion.  They'll discuss some topic for several pages without even writing down the basic, relevant journal entry.  One of the wordiest, most poorly written accounting books I have ever had the displeasure of studying from 
 I got this for my son's 9th birthday. It looked like so much fun, but it is just a bunch of colored ping pong balls on top of a hair dryer. Lots of tiny pieces. They invented a lot of ridiculously complicated games to disguise the essential boringness. I almost returned it but couldn't face the repacking. No one plays with it, I'll probably pitch it into the trash in a few weeks 
 What a disappointment.  The TV series bears almost no resemblance to the book.  A few character names are the same and the "Carrie" and "Mr. Big" characters are drawn roughly the same as the TV characters.  All I can say is that the TV scriptwriters did an outstanding job at developing the series' well-rounded characters from this mess of a "book."  There is virtually no plot or character development.  The book is a collection of seemingly unconnected short essays in interview format.  Bushnell owes a debt of gratitude to the screenplay writer who was genius enough to take her twisted mess of words and turn them into the scintillating story that we know from the series 
 I've always loved the original trilogy, but these prequals are just awful. This episode 3 was probably the most dissapointing. I had hoped that maybe lucas could salvage this horrible trilogy but he just made it worse. Horrible acting and writing really sent this movie down the toilet. The only slightly decent thing in the movie was the lightsaber scene between anakin and obi wan. 
 I've loved Jeanne Ray's other books (Julie & Romeo, Step Ball Change, and Eat Cake). I found them all to be well written, funny and entertaining reads, with varied and likeable characters. This book doesn't come close to meeting the standard set by the others. It isn't funny at all. All of the characters act horribly, including the martyred Julie who lets everyone in her family walk all over her. I haven't read a book in a long time where I didn't like a single character. (And I liked these people in the first book - Julie and Romeo). I highly recommend her other books, but I'd stay away from this one 
 Plain and simple this DVD is not worth more than 10 bucks. These matches are all from the past year and a half and should not all have been on this DVD. They had nothing from the Tennessee Era, which was a big disappointment, and was an even bigger mistake. The best thing about this DVD is a pretty lame interview with Jerry Lynn, it might have been boring but at least it was something you never seen before.  The 2 bonus matches are terrible and they don't even edit out the commercials from the broadcast, how freaking low budget is that?   TNA really dropped the ball on this DVD, I hope Volume 2 is much better, but with most of the DVD featuring matches from Impact I highly doubt it. If this truly is the best of this division, then this is one sorry division 
 Loud HISS all the time. The sound comes and goes all the time. Works 10 mins. then stops. Have to turn volume up loud to get it back. When working sounds ok. But will not continue working. I have a pretty new Sony TV and am only 12 feet away but the unit just does not work. Shame, I liked it when it worked 
 Diving into maya 6 unexperienced, without an aid is terribly confusing, but diving into maya 6 with this book is not that much better -- it is like a nonswimmer being thrown into the deep end of the pool with a deflated lifesaver.   Sure, the directions are pretty easy to follow, but the problems arise when there are MISSING directions! I was having a headache trying to get something to work like it supposedly did in the book, when I realized that the author FORGOT to include a vital step! I would not have been able to get ahead if I had not figured out the problem on my own (through trial and error). Shame Shame SHAME on the author! Sorry we beginning users are not as professional and proficient in the program.   I give this book a C+ at best. Well-written simple directions mean absolutely nothing if they are not complete! 
 While this book does contain many good rules of thumb for teachers to follow covering many aspects of the teaching experience, much of the information in this book is very basic and obvious.  Most people who have had any experience in the classroom, even as a student teacher, would take many of the tips in this book for granted.  This book would probably be the most helpful as an introduction for someone who has not taken any education classes and would like to become a teacher in his or her content area.  If you are just graduating from an education program, skip this one 
 I did not like this book.  Lao is a VERY simple language, but this book uses a very complex approach 
 I read this book as a follow up to Philip Jenkins's "The Next Christendom."  Unfortunately, it does not compare well.  The book reads like a FAQ (frequently asked questions) from a poorly written website as an infomercial promoting the greatness of Africanized Christianity.  The author makes several interesting points however.  One is that Christianity has grown faster than Islam because Christianity has allowed for the Bible to be translated in tens if not hundreds of different vernacular languages.  Christianity has even allowed indigenous population to use their own word for God.  Islam has shown no such flexibility or adaptation as one is not allowed to translate the Qoran.  Another interesting point is that according to the author, Christianity at the onset was a religion of peace meanwhile Islam was a religion of the State and the Sword as Mohammed was both a military and political leader.  The author states that the crusades were an aberration of Christianity's history.  And, that today all Christians feel guilt and shame when remembering the crusades.  Meanwhile, Muslims are proud of all the historical and current Jihads they campaigned for.   But the above are just interesting concepts lost in a sea of directionless questions and answers.  The author is brilliant, highly educated (teacher at both Harvard and Yale).  But, his book is little more than a random collection of his own subjective opinions not supported well  enough by much facts, studies, or reference to other works.  Because of the odd question and answer format, the author never develops a coherent and focused theory tied to the title's subject.   As mentioned, if you want to study this subject more effectively I strongly recommend Philip Jenkins "The Next Christendom" instead.               
 I cannot believe what an ergonomically ill-fitting and horribly working product this is. The best thing I can say about it is that it looks pretty. Some others are satisfied, so I can only surmise that there are vast differences in the quality of the products leaving the assembly line. Unfortunately, this brand-new can-opener is going in the trash. 
 This is the second Sony cube clock/radio I have owned.. The first one lasted 25 yrs. I see the improvements made.. I like everything better EXCEPT it is difficult to see time in darkness..The background light is good, but the digital numbers are not dark enough. 
 Petra of all places. Supernatural protection, persecution, on ad naseum. The one drug on, and on, and on,  and on ......  Same tired story, persecution by Carpathia a lame attempt at evil incarnate and his lackies. Sorry..   I think the series denegrates Christianity rather then exalting it.   I've read all 12 and found it morose and condemning. The opposite of how I view Christianity is. 
 I used to think of regressions as harmless pursuits, but have since learned that "memories" created by the mind are virtually indistinquishable from real memories and that people who seek to create them tend to believe them, even when those memories later turn out to be demonstrably false.  In his opening paragraph, Andrews notes: "We many never be able to prove that we lived before. Even if we are able to produce names, dates and places, it still does not proved that we lived at that time and place."   So why the book?  "Because, even without conclusive proof, the benefits for personal empowerment, healing and enlightenment are tremendous."  The "theology" of reincarnation comes from unsure sources, one of which is the primitive African Zulus. As explained in this book the souls of people depart and go to sleep until notified that another learning experience awaits it. Then it returns as a human or as an animal.   My own personal view is that man should seek God for spiritual knowledge. Once one begins trusting in "suggestions" of unsure memories, the foundation becomes more than a little shakey. Three different people claiming to be the same historical figure is something that should cause anyone to reexamine this belief in past lives, and this is something that's not difficult to find. False memories seem real but aren't. That's why books like this don't sound dangerous, but are.    
 The Wisdom of Menopause provides an accurate description of what happens to a woman's body during and after ovarian failure (menopause). This book describes in detail the negative effects of menopause (ovarian failure) while still describing it as a natural and normal process to embrace. I don't believe we should be so willing to allow our ovaries to fail, instead we should look for ways to help them work better and for longer. 
 What's with all the titles using the word Fantastic?  Wow, that's so original!  Did you write that yourself?  Anyway, I was disappointed with this one, like many others here.  I thought it was a big waste of time and talent.  I would have liked to have more of a plot-line set up, and some type of comarardarie between the Fantastic Four.    But this slack was garbage.    I would not rent or purchase this movie.  MC White said:  Not F.... darn it, I almost did the same thing 
 After publishing the best introduction to home brewing Papazian released this unenlightening tome.  His snappy style, so essential in his first book, sounds dull and contrived.  One third of the book is complete filler as he lists 60 pages of various beer styles along with their specific gravities, etc.  This information could have been presented in a two page spread.    Additionally, he offers little in the way of advanced brewing technique.  The one saving grace of this book is the recipe section, with interesting ideas like a lambic barley wine and a raspberry imperial stout.  If you are looking for a book that offers a firm overview of all-grain brewing then I can recommend 'Dave Miller's Homebrewing Guide' or Noonan's 'Brewing Lager Beer.'  Papazian's  book will most likely be a complete disappointment 
 This book may be helpful for some people who want to know more about possible conspiracies. Personally, I believe some of them; but that's not why I purchased this book. This book is highly misrepresented on Trudeau's infomecials. There are no specific recommendations for treatment of any illnes in this book. Only some vague references to start you on a paper chase. There is not even an index in the book to direct you to information on a specific illness. This book is basically another infomercial for his subscription website. 
 I can't understand the good reviews given by others to this movie. Frankly, I thought it was a dog.  Not to say that it had no redeeming features - the friendship between the young girl and the lawn man was endearing, if improbable. And the girl herself was a real sweetie, and a good actress - perfect for the part. In fact, the acting all around was admirable.  But the script! Yikes! Not a single character in the whole movie - with the partial exceptions of the two protagonists - had any motivation for anything they did. People acting awkward or mean (in fact, just about everyone in the movie other than said two was mean), or spiteful, or stupid, for no reason at all!   It seems as though somehow, the movie could have been good, but didn't make it. Call it almost watchable.  I came away from Lawn Dogs (Yawn Dogs?) feeling not at all enriched. Puzzled, perhaps, at why anyone would make such a movie. Well, there was that admirable, unlikely friendship. But that was all.  Pass this one by 
 No easy to read at all. I think you would have to be the author to understand the book..... 
 This CD was just an excuse to highlight two new singles, one of which is "Im a Survivor" (a terrible song).  But the rest of the songs (the greatest hits) aren't much better.  Its all Reba's maze of pop stuff...inconsistent and not worthy of her talent. MCA needed to put something out because Reba went Hollywood around this time trying to be an actress (which, in my opinion, she would have done better to leave well enough alone).  So she didn't record because she was burned out.  Its no wonder with stuff like "One Honest Heart", "How Was I to Know" and other unmemorable Reba tunes.  Nothing grabs the heart here like her other greatest hits packages that contained Reba classics like "Somebody Should Leave", "Whoever's In New England"...you get the picture.  There are no classic Reba songs on this compilation.  
 Admittedly, my interest in Maile Meloy initially came entirely from my enjoyment of her younger brother Colin Meloy's band, the Decemberists.  Meloy's debut short story collection is extremely promising in a lot of key areas: her stories have a strong sense of place, and she's got both a good ear for dialogue and a strong handle on narrative pacing.  Things actually happen in these stories, in other words, something that can't always be said about similar short story collections.  However, it seems that Colin inherited all of the family's sense of humor genes, as Maile's stories are almost relentlessly bleak and often downright depressing.  A wider variety of emotional shadings would go a long way towards enhancing this collection 
 The book was very good but the movie version wasn't. Julia Ormond does her best acting (that's not saying much) as Smila. The audience needs to sympathize with Smila but she's so abrasive and self pitying it's hard to. Instead of returning to Greenland and her dead mother's Inuit culture she stays in Europe and sulks about it. Her only friend is an Inuit boy who was, she suspects, murdered. Her lonely task, for no-one, not even the boy's half witted mother seems to care about him, is to find out who did it and why.  Which leads me to the ending. It was one of the most unsatisfying, ubelievable resolutions I've ever seen in a movie. In all, Smila's Sense of Snow is a movie that could've been good but never quite makes the mark.  Perhaps a different actress (Would it have been impossible to find a real Inuit or at least one who looked right?) Perhaps a more vigorous director, perhaps a better script and perhaps an ending that made a lick of sense could've saved this movie but none of that happened so we're left with a mess. 
 What a waste of money. Try buying something else. This lasted me only a couple of months 
 I admired Scholl's singing on his "Gramophone Award" winning Vivaldi CD, and later heard him on various occasions cooperating with Jacobs, Herreweghe and Christie, but - to my ears - with much less success.  There were moments when I was thrilled: recently with his and B. Bonney's  "Stabat Mater" (under Christophe Rousset) and  Solomon (with  Mccreesh), but a recital is a different matter. Here you have to built a  dramatic tension by singing alone (well if supported by a good orchestra)  and if you cannot achieve that, the recital will turn into a sequence of  pleasantly sounding songs. And that's what happens here - Scholl's  "Heroes" are bland. I haven't been able to listen to this record  more than 2 times, with the exeption of two tracks devoted to Gluck, this  however only because Gluck is my fairly recent "discovery" and I  have been waiting impatiently for a delivery of CDs with some of his works.  What else could I do than listen to what I already had? For that matter,  von Otter's Mozart/Gluck/Haydn disc with Pinnock gave me not only more  Gluck, but also much more pleasure (as did Mozart and Haydn).  Scholl's  Handel disappointed me. I think that his success with Solomon lies in the  fact, that there Scholl was put in the particular dramatical context and  did not rely exclusively on his famed voice. Here he cannot make much out  of his "Heroes". The orchestra is not of much help, neither is  quickish tempo, especially in more reflective passages. You simply hear  that the artist has no time to take a breath! Can you contemplate while  gasping?  This is not a CD that I will listen to very often, I do not even  know, if I will ever come back to it. It will sit in one of the darker  corners of my CD racks and wait for better times.  By the way, PR people in  the classical music market are really messing things up. I believe that  excellent artists - and Scholl certainly IS one of them - do not need PR  publicity and completely unjustified releases like this one. But maybe I am  just spoiled and eager to hear more previoulsy unrecorded music, from  composers I have no idea about. With all respect to my beloved Handel.. 
 Lian Hearn lost me on this one.  This is the third and final book of the original Tales of the Otori trilogy (there's a fourth book set decades after this one ends that reportedly resolves the one dangling issue from the trilogy) and it is easily the worst.  Across the Nightingale Floor was very good with swift pacing, a mentally tough heroine and solid action; Grass for his Pillow was a decent middle volume that moved the story forward, set up the final book and did not lose too much momentum.  Brilliance of the Moon is a relative flop.  The two main characters, Takeo and Kaede, make laughably stupid decisions.  Kaede loses too much of her inner strength -- she becomes simply the damsel in distress.  And the anti-climactic, deus ex machina resolution to Takeo's quest is entirely too unsatisfying.    If you can read Book 1 and enjoy it as a stand-alone novel despite its status as the first in a trilogy/tetralogy, do so.  But you're forewarned before you get too deep into the story, the ending in this volume is pure disappointment 
 We were disappointed in this DVD and thought it was a waste of money. We did not learn anything new.   They went through things quickly, everything was so basic, things that are mainly common sense.  I felt this was a big huge waste of money, and is now in the trash 
 Dangerous Skies is a story that is mainly about two boys that live in the middle of the 1700s.  One of the friends is white and the other one is black so they have a lot of disagreements and they spend much of the story trying to figure things out.  One of the people lives on a farm and does a lot of work on it.  The other one is black so they get a lot of discrimination and stuff like that.  I do not really like this book because it was really boring and it had no point.  If you want to fine out what happens in the end you should read the book 
 I think Hemingway wanted to do two things:  (1) critique certain aspects of how WWII was fought (particularly the politicalization of battle plans); and (2) pay homage to his beloved Venice.  To do so, he crafted a fairly thin story about an old soldier who finds himself in one last love with a girl a fraction of his age.  The plot (to the extent there is one) and the relationship between the characters would probably make a nice short story.  The bulk of the book is taken up by tourist writing about Venice (locales, architecture, food, markets, layout, and, of course, the canals) and a journalist's rants about US generals in WWII.  Diehard Hemingway fans will find some jewels worth the read; others should stay away 
 I bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses.  There must be a quality control problem.  My bottle had no noticible, pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair.  I was only trying to go 1 day without washing.  What a disappointing product and a waste of my money.  : 
 Self-Appointed beer expert Jackson churns out more amateur fluff in this shallow study.  Hardly ultimate and hardly scholarship - at least not on the level of Gunderson, Klein, or Passel.  Very disappointing to true  established experts 
 While Dr. Grandin's poignant unraveling of the mysteries of autism deserves the accolades it has received, her perspectives on animals are deeply tainted by her research into "humane" slaughter techniques, which ultimately have an economic rather than a purely scientific rationale. After all, the meat industry cares not one iota about whether animals are treated humanely or not, only whether they can be "disassembled" as quickly and efficiently as possible. Thus, while Grandin's work may indeed make the treatment of farm animals more humane when they reach their brutal demise, it nevertheless facilitates the expansion of an industry that is anything but humane, bringing ever greater numbers of animals under the sway of its remorseless logic of bloodthirsty death. History does not judge the petty functionaries of the Final Solution, the ones who devised more efficient means of killing human beings, to be heroes; nor should history judge Temple Grandin to be a savior of animals. If her concern for animals goes as deep as she claims it does, she should turn the wealth she garners from the meat industry against its practices, donating all of her meat industry earnings to animal rights causes. Ultimately that is the only way she can begin to free herself of the moral stain of responsibility for the brutal death of innocent creatures 
 I have already returned the wrong items you sent me. just return my money please 
 The book is fine, except I had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer.  She's such a boring character.  She's young, but not motivated to work.  In fact, she quited one of her jobs when Macon covered her rent.  The dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men, and get support.  The point is that she doesn't enjoy the job, thus, a detailed description of her dog training job (which she doesn't seem to enjoy) was just a boring digression 
 All the characters in this book were shallow, selfish and boring. The writing was good but I could not relate to nor sympathize with any of the characters 
 They are kindof on the bland side, and I'd rather spend my calories elsewhere!  But they are on the low-carb side.  150 calories, 7g total fat (2g saturated), 8g sugar, 5g fiber, 1g sugar alcohol, 10g protein 
 The first Butterfly Effect is one of my all-time favorite movies. With that in mind, I eagerly started watching BE2. Within the first 5 minutes it became clear that I was going to have to stretch the truth in order to claim this was a good movie. But after finishing it, it was clear that I would have to flat-out lie to do that.  There is one and only one redeeming factor in this movie: Erica Durance naked. But it's too softcore, short, and pointless to really be worth anything.  The writing is terrible. The story is lifted directly from the original, only without any semblance of personal feeling or emotion. It manages to be both predictable and borderline nonsensical, a feat unparelleled in modern film. The protagonist comes off as an idiotic, self-concerned, petty jerk that even jerks would have a hard time identifying with. The acting is...barely passable, for the most part, but the story's protagonist is just plain bad at expressing all the things this character needs to express.  The first one was great because you never knew exactly what to expect - how long would he be able to keep doing this? Would this one be the last? In the sequel, this is gone, but without any extra twists or added value to keep it interesting.  If you have any fond memories of the first one, avoid this turd 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 I loved "A Walk in the Woods" and "In a Sunburned Country".  They were funny and witty, and made me want to hike the Trail and visit Australia.  I am about to travel to Great Britain, so I read this book with much anticipation.  I found it ill-spirited and mostly humorless.  I started skimming as it was so repetitive that any chapter could have been about any town he visited.  It almost made me NOT want to go to Great Britain.  I don't understand the reviews that say he talks fondly of England.  In my opinion, he bad-mouthed almost everything, and came out looking like an often foul-mouthed old curmudgeon.  If you're still interested in this book, check it out of a library and decide for yourself.  I'm sorry I spent any time on it, but glad I didn't waste any money. I gave it 2 stars to be charitable 
 The book I received appears a very cheap copy of the original book. There is no ISBN and copyright page, even the cover appears a cheap colour photocopy. What's the story?? You pay $20 for a book you expect to get a quality printed book. It mentions that it is published by Harper Collins though I am unable to find any reference to it on their website. I believe Amazon and/or the author owe buyers an explanation 
 The most valuable thing I learn is from another book: rent a multi-family vacation house with my friends, 16 people for $199 a day. We all enjoy the stay at a luxury emerald island resort. check this out: http://www.cyberrentals.com/index.cfm/property/12668 
 Honestly, I found this textbook to be hard to follow, difficult to understand, and many of the recipes and formulas did not work. Also, there were not many photos, and the diagrams were confusing. This certainly is not for the home chef, and I hesitate to recommend this to professional students either. 
 This particular DVD edition of Nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film's mood.  I'm not sure when this "score" was "written", although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film.  Nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film.  With this edition's music, I got confused at times between what I saw and what I heard, and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while.  If you want an affective, edge-of-the-seat experience out of Nosferatu, I reccomend another edition.  
 I bought Zig Ziglar's book Raising Positive Kids in a Negative World, and had many problems with it. I am an Northeaster Illinois University student majoring in early childhood education, and I know a LOT about children. I thought this book would give me more insight on how I could help other parents raise positive children. Throughout his book Zig Ziglar constantly pats his self on the back/toots his own horn for all his accomplishments and "parents he has reached". He might know a thing or two about writing books on how to sell things, but he should leave raising positive children to the professionals. Yes, at the beginning of the book I was hooked and thought this man knew it all. I only got half way through the book when I realized that he knows nothing. I did not enjoy some of his ideas, for example if you and your children are not religious then they will be terrible people. I know plenty of wonderful children who do not believe in god. It made me sick to hear how he feels about working mothers, and women in general. Zig(what kind of name is that) is extremely sexist! Don't waste your time on this book. YUCK! If anyone wants this book(as a coaster of course) I will very happily send it to you 
 I bought this TV to use during lunch breaks at work and to take to football games.  It couldn't pickup any VHF channels and could only pickup the same 2 UHF channels.  The next day I shipped it back for a refund 
 Horrible movie, only worth watching if you are a Jayne Mansfield or Phyllis Diller fan. Movie looks like it was cheaply filmed and only uses about 4 scenes in entire movie. However, if you like cartoons, than you might like this movie. The singer Laurie Berger is the funniest when she sings and dances her solo. Save your money for a fast food burger. 
 I wouldn't let my dog sleep on these sheets.  They are of the worst quality imaginable.   We took ours back and purchased plain ole porta crib sheets and they fit PERFECTLY.  I recommend the Koala Baby name brand porta rib sheet.  They are available at BRU and have elastic all the way around, making for a snug fit.  And the quality is 1000 times improved over the PNP sheets 
 After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to try Skeleton Man as my first Hillerman novel.  Unfortunately, I'm about 100 pages into it and have decided to give up on it.    I read a lot of novels and have never really had a problem with this before, but I find Hillerman's writing style to be very choppy and awkward.  I find I have to re-read sentences to catch the meaning because it just doesn't flow smoothly.     Here's an example of one paragraph that I opened to randomly:  "Getting this ceremonial procession from Tuve's village on Second Mesa to the canyon rim and them to the riverbank involved describing several more stops for prayers and offerings, the placing of painted feathers in the proper places with the proper songs, and putting prayer sticks where the proper spirits traditionally visited.  By the time Tuve had brought them to the Hopi shrine at the tribe's cliff-bottom salt deposits, Joanna Craig had looked at her watch three times that Chee had noticed.  Navajo fashion, he hadn't glanced at his own.  Tuve would finish when he finished."  It's like he talks in short cuts that you're expected to follow. When I'm reading this book, my mind is wandering all over the place because the text doesn't draw me in.  I'm glad he has a lot of fans out there, but I'm not one of them 
 I have had this book for awhile and re-read it last night.. Overall, this book is a disappointing read. The only worthwhile material in the book is the 5-count and his section on crap comps which I thought could have been expanded. The rest is stories and added technical fluff. 5-count is the key in his system and if you do not know what it is, I would pick up one of his books for the concept and knowledge... just not this one.   I would recommend 'Winning Craps for the Serious Player' J. Edward Allen. Very good book 
 The reference to craft "superstars" should have warned me off. The lowly T-shirt shows up as a placemat, a lampshade, a car-lot hanging banner, cafï¿½ curtains, and a rug - oh yeah, and a couple of overworked wearables, too. Tricky projects show off the wit of their too-cool creators rather than enrich the lives of DIY readers.Who needs it? 
 This was the first cookbook I ever bought, back in my early-'90s bachelor days. I tried the coq au vin recipe for a big dinner party -- and it flopped so catastrophically that even a then-amateur cook like me realized that no human can screw up a dish this badly without help. I rarely ever touched the cookbook again. I've made the apple pie several times over the years, but had to seriously adjust the cream recommendation of the recipe, because it made for soupy (if tasty) pies. It took four times using this recipe and ending up with soupy pie to realize **it wasn't me, but the recipe.** For some reason, I kept the book with me (never throw out a cookbook). I became a pretty decent cook, and married one too. Two days ago, my wife decided to make the Comforting Shredded Beef. She asked me to come into the kitchen to light the cognac the authors instruct you to pour over the browned pot roast. The ...thing exploded! I kid you not, we followed the recipe *exactly*, and started a kitchen fire, which required use of the fire extinguisher, and evacuating the apartment until it aired out.. 
 He gave it all he had, but there just wasn't much of interest there.  He's a self-described, turmoiled loser, and not very interesting one to boot.  Kafka, Roth, and Jeremy Leven (Satan, et al), write about similar troubled Jews, and are much funnier and interesting. I like his honesty, but, it's not worth the price of admission 
 I love the Office.  What I don't love is Amazon listing a 3-disc boxed set of Seasons 1 and 2 and the 2 BBC specials for sale and then mailing me 2 separate discs of Seasons 1 and 2.  So be aware that Amazon is not shipping what they advertise here.  I have contacted them and have had not a reply about this 
 Rest Stop is a horrible movie. Sure there are many killings, some with a decent amount of gore and creativity, but that doesn't make up for a bad plotline with a less than pleasing cast. The end and alternate ending both make no sense whatsoever, and after watching this movie, you'll wonder why u wasted your money and how anyone could've thought this was a good movie 
 Another author that I was expecting more of after all the fuss over him.  Some parts of this book were mildly funny/interesting, but overall it just droned on and on.  Had to force myself to finish it.  
 I bought this book because I'm venturing more deeply into interior photography after many years of portraiture and architectural/travel work. This "updated and expaned" edition has simply tacked on a couple of cursory chapters on digital photography to a tired and outdated manuscript that needs reworking from top to bottom. You won't learn much here, with a lot of topics, almost all covered inadequately. The author appears to know whats he's doing (judging from the sample photos) but he's revealing very few secrets. I've learned a lot more through trial and error. If you're interested in interior lighting, for example, consider John Freeman's Lighting for Interiors. It's dramatically more useful 
 It is obvious that the authors are biased against the Disney corporation and wish to force their perspective on everyone else. The money I spent to purchase this book could have been better used elsewhere. I wish i could shred the book and send the pieces back to each author.  THE ONLY REASON IT RECIEVED ONE STAR IS THAT ZERO WAS NOT AN OPTION.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON PURCHASING THIS PIECE OF TRASH 
 I bought this book last year and read the first few chapters before getting bored. In other words, I had no desire to continue reading it. Much of what he says aren't his ideas, he shamelessly borrows from the great thinkers, so it's probably better just to buy THEIR books instead of one from an author who simply quotes others. He apparently writes book after book regurgitating material he's done before or from others to get rich.   Dyer DEFINITELY has an intention, and it's to get rich by selling his mediocre books. 
 The movie is absolute garbage.  Everyone's a badguy(almost all the characters but Pierce are involved in some crazy plot to blow everyone else up), the acting by almost all involved is horrendous, and the editing blows!  The silly love scene in the bathtub actually has 3 hair style changes where the woman's bangs disappear and reappear and disappear again, then reappear again in bed.  You can see the people running from the bomb threats just falling over in panic, the "bad guys" completely overact and many don't seam to have any reason to even be involved.  Hah, Pierce got shot point blank by two guys with uzi's and still not only gets away, but blows them up and goes on to finish the mastermind off and rescue the girl.  It kind of reminded of a Beverly Hill's Cop(even has the same love interest) without any comedic value and an all B-list acting crew.  I would say don't waste your time... but it does have a certain "so bad it's good" quality.  Just know what your walking into :) (Btw I can't understand how this possibly has a 3 1/2 star rating... it really is bad) 
 While the book does validate IC-which 10 years ago was relatively unknown, the treatments will not work for everyone.  I believe everyone needs hope with this dreadful disease, and at a first pass, this book provides it.  I must thank the doctor for that.  I read the book, was a patient of the doctor, and followed the protocol for 2 years.  ... 
 I was somewhat disappointed in this book despite its endorsement by one of my business school classmates.  Professor Tichy discusses already well known principles of leadership within the context of what is promoted as a "new" approach.  Only a few individuals and companies are profiled and are used repeatedly throughout the book.  The examples cited fit awkwardly into the message that is being presented.  The title of the book attributes greatness to the individuals profiled based on only one attribute--a belief in teaching and learning.  This seems such a narrow focus on which to base such accolades 
 I felt like I had entered the twilight zone.  A fawning tale about the highest ranking foreign spy in American history that fails to even deal with the now universally accepted truth that Hopkins was a Soviet Agent.  How this book could have been published subsequent to the release of the Venona documentation is a mystery that can only be explained by the fact that the publisher is The Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute Series on Diplomatic and Economic History.  Your grandfather was a traitor, Ms. Hopkins deal with it 
 Just received the German 4 disc digipak. GOOD NEWS. played 10 mins of both - no problems. Menus are all in English (or German) all the extra's on the English R2 SE's are here except for the photo gallery.  The sound is very good and the restored english mono is BETTER than the MGM 5.1 also on here with the commentary and German mono. The 5.1 sounds muddled compared to the mono which is strong and has good clarity and separation.  Picture. No problems I could see on my 6ft screen via InFocus 5700 projector from an Arcam FMJ-DV29 DVD player. Player is set to progressive playback and did not have to change anything.  Only watched first 10mins of each but doing A-B comparisons with the English R2 MGM SE's the German ones are noticeably better, they look less washed out, contrast is not set so high and colours are a lot more pronounced especially on Fistful, which is why I bought this set, but also on Few Dollars More as well.  They are also cleaned up a bit more as well as most importantly Few Dollars More is at last the full version, which no MGM DVD is worldwide..... 
 This slap dash compilation of short descriptions was probably put together as a quick way to make a few bucks. The authors are indeed esteemed but I bet each one wrote their part from memory on a Sunday afternoon. The battle descriptions are dry and confusing--most of the maps are useless in determining the sequence of events. Geography seems to be sort of thrown in as a catchy way to snare amateur buffs like myself. I usually read reviews before I buy a book and this time I just "assumed" good quality due to the National Geographic Society imprimatur. Stay away 
 There are only two good things about this movie: one, the pure novelty of seeing Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jennifer Love Hewitt in the same movie, and two, the great music (cool soundtrack, plus an actual appearance by Southern Culture on the Skids).  Other than that, this is pretty darn bad.  Although, I have to say that the laughably awful performance from Freddie "one facial expression for every occasion" Prinze Jr. can be really entertaining, but for all the wrong reasons.  Also, this movie has what is probably the most ridiculous scene in the history of movies: the scene in which Jennifer Love Hewitt kind of starts to freak out, and the blonde dude grabs her and is practically strangling her, and her idiot boyfriend (Prinze, naturally) is just standing there like a dumb@ss watching him do it.  Man, if anyone even thought about touching my girlfriend like that, I'd break his arm at the very least, I don't care if he's my friend or not.  Well, at least they made fun of how dumb it was in "Scary Movie".  So anyway, yeah, one star for me.  This was even worse than "Scream" (at least that one had a cool opening scene).  My advice is to pick up the soundtrack, and leave the movie on the shelf 
 Be aware that you may share this same experience if you download the book.  After the book was downloaded to my computer, I was prevented from printing past the first 60 pages due to properties designed into the file.  The book is over 300 pages.    In order for me to receive a printed copy of the entire book, it will be necessary for me to have the hard copy sent to me.  Since I do wish to have the hard copy, I will reorder and pay the shipping and the cost of another copy of the book 
 The first book was great, it had an interesting plot and great characters. The second book wavered on the plot, but it was still good. The third book had the characters, but the original plot was gone. It had been replaced by a confusing, uninteresting, and bad idea that had come out of nowhere.  This book has not only thrown away the plot, it also practically got rid of most of the original characters. And the new plot that appeared in its place was poorly done. He doesn't explain what's going on very well, probably because he doesn't understand it himself. What was Adams thinking when he wrote this? I'm going to read the last book in the series, but I'm not sure what to expect 
 I picked up the first book in this series (The Eyre Affair) based purely on its premise and was left somewhat underwhelmed. Still, the potential for the series seemed so large that I went ahead and read this second one too, only to be even less enchanted with the franchise. This is a pure sequel, and any newcomers are advised to read the misadventures of Thursday Next is strict order, lest one miss out of allusions to past events. Although... on further consideration, maybe it doesn't matter, since clearly anything can and will happen in this series, and Fforde isn't all that interested in keeping to a linear plotline anyway.   The setting is the same as the first book, an alternate mid-1980s England in which literature is the preeminent social preoccupation. Fresh off the events of "The Eyre Affair", Thursday Next (a police officer specializing in literature related crimes, such as first-edition forgeries, valuable manuscript thefts, and the like) is gritting her teeth through a new round of fame as the woman who saved Jane Eyre (and changed the ending for the better), when all she wants to do is cuddle up at home with her new husband Landen. Unfortunately, the evil Goliath Corporation has managed to use a corrupt member of the Chronogaurd (timestream police) to delete Landen from this timeline and are holding his existence hostage. In the first book Thursday imprisoned one of their top men inside Poe's "The Raven", and it seems they want him back.   This a potentially interesting plot, but it keeps get lost amidst all the other things Fforde throws into the mix. Most notable are a series of strange coincidences which keep coming close to killing Thursday (and are also linked to events in the first book). Another plotline concerns the discovery of a "lost" Shakespeare play, which looks to be the most important literary event of the century, if Thursday can authenticate it. There's also the small matter of Thursday's pregnancy. And just when one is comfortable with Thursday's role as a "SpecOps Litratech", and that whole milieu, she's thrown into an entirely new one as a member of "Jurisfiction", a kind of police comprised of book characters who move around in different literary works and maintain order... Finally, her father pops up to inform her that something in the timestream has gone wrong and the entire world is going to be turned into a mass of pink sludge in a few days unless he can figure it out, and can she help him. Phew!  I've probably missed one or two elements, but you get the idea. Fforde is just brimming with nifty ideas, but the shame of it is that he can't stop and give any of them the attention they deserve. It's impossible to get invested in any of the plotlines when you know he's just going to move on to something else in a few pages, and it's impossible to care about the characters when their existence is utterly malleable, as is time and place. I suppose it's all meant to be puckish good fun, but the overall effect is more an attention deficit disorder Nancy Drew heroine meets a poor-man's Douglas Adams. The book has its occasional moments, but the humor is far too broad and unsubtle, and there's absolutely no narrative tension. All the literary in jokes in the world can't save this shambling wreck, and I don't think I'll be moving on to the next book. 
 Since the late 90's Lonely Planet have been dwindling down the number of destinations and hostel listings in these guides and replacing that space with more five star hotels, fine dining and other useless information backpackers will never use.  In this edition Lonely Planet lists the most expensive Hotel in Australia, Palazzo Versace in their Gold Coast accommodation listings.  They are so out of touch with their target market now it is not funny.    Buy the Backpackers Ultimate Guide (BUG) Australia instead as it is what Lonely Planet and Lets Go used to be.  A comprehensive coverage of all hostels in a destination, not just the one or two that pay to be listed and no weight increasing space taking up useless information that we backpackers do not want to lug around an entire continent.      If you can find an old copy from ten years ago buy it otherwise give Lonely Planet a miss!  
 How can Stephen Mitchell even think of such an abberation - editing Walt Whitman's greatest poem? Sure, there are several versions of the Song of Myself, but if you want to read Whitman, read the original. The first version is the most powerful, and Whitman toned it down over the years, turning it into "poetry" rather than his initial burst of enthusiasm. There are several editions of the poem that will let you get the true texts: for example, the Library of America's complete Whitman has both the first version of Leaves of Grass and the "deathbed" version, which Whitman revised shortly before his death. There are other versions throughout Whitman's career, as he added poems to the Leaves, and tinkered with existing poems. But this book is a sham. Avoid it 
 Has Danieele Steel been abducted by aliens or has she been "Kloned" and this insane Klone wrote this book.  I actually thought about not finishing this book but I thought there might be a logical ending...Beyond disappointing.  Her characters have no substance, I don't want to meet the person who could relate to these whimpy weirdos.  This might be the worst book I've ever read. I just read this book, quite quickly in one afternoon. I think I've pretty much purchased and read every Danielle Steel book she's ever written as they used to be entertaining quick reads. I understand she has become an empire but must she also be a book writing factory. There is never much suprise as to how a DS book will end, the pleasure in reading them comes from the twist and turns, historical and geographical research she puts into her books. This book reads more like a short story as many of her other recent books. Definately not worth the hardcover price, the paperback price or even the used price. Time to slow down and put out some quality work instead of quantity 
 Half way through I'm wondering if I want to finish this turkey.  And that's disappointing.  I really did like Stepsister.  I also believe Wicked is a stand alone work of art!  I recommend it to anyone I meet.  I love Mr. Maguire's twists on classic fairy tales.  I hope he's not being forced by the "powers that be" (publishing companies) to crank them out quicker than he is comfortable doing.  I'm sure it took a long time for him to create Wicked and fill in all those gaps and answer all those questions!  No stone was left unturned.  Perhaps he even had some of the questions already answered in his mind for "confessions'" Cinderella and Stepsister?  It just doesn't seem that Mirror Mirror is as well put together and researched as the others.  Therefore, it seems a little disjointed --- lacking in flow.  It also seemed like an awful lot of writing just for the sake of meeting a minimum word count.  I do hope Mr. Maguire has more time (or whatever else he needs ) in order to produce another Wicked.  Perhaps we, as readers, should also coinsider Wicked as a singualar work of art by this artist and not compare everything he writes against that benchmark?  Just an idea 
 Reviewer Alianore's opinion "Rather too indulgent of its subject" is a very accurate portrayal of Weir's work. I will try to add something to that near perfect review. (Note: I listened to the unabridged audiobook of "Queen Isabella", 22 hrs on 18 CDs).  The first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable, loaded with period details. The last third is the worst: Weir's fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation -- nay, elevation -- of Queen Isabella to the role of long-suffering, much-wronged, highly-deserving, and late-redeemed Just Queen of England.  This book is really "subjective, rhetorical biographal dramatization". I do not consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective history and analysis. It is rhetoric because of the endless "weasel words" (and expressions) used copiously throughout: "Some say", "It has been said", "Many believe", "Therefore we may assume", "It can be inferred" ... this isn't just an attribute of her style ... it *is* her style comprehensively. These expressions occur many hundreds of times, commonly in conjunction with Wier's subjective analyses that present her beloved Isabella in the best possible light, always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons.  Equally irksome is Weir's double-standard of historical psychological analysis. She is always 'declaring' for us the contents of Isabella's thoughts. Remarkable gift she has for this. Many times Weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not meaningful. But then moments later she will portray Isabella's actions from a 21st century point of view ... always telling the reader how Isabella must have, might have, could have, would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another ... often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present-day psychosocial interpretation of 800 year old history. This isn't historical writing, it is historical op-ed, with an obvious agenda.  I don't loathe this work, it is enjoyable in many parts for its color characterizations and depth of detail. The narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing. But this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography. (Other egregious examples of such hagiography include Edmund Morris' "Rise of Theodore Roosevelt" and "Theodore Rex". I could not complete either of those since Morris is so obviously enthralled by his subject, lovingly lionizing him in every sappy sentence. Yuck. Really.)  If prefer more history when reading (or listening to) history. And much, much less editorial subjectivity, retroactive psychology, biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation. The only way I could enjoy "Isabella" by Weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly, taking it with "several pounds of salt" as the above referenced reviewer advises.  2.5/5 
 Well the premise of the book was enough to get me to buy it; I love old houses and late 19th century Americana, fascinated by interesting families and the thought of generations of Bostonians returning to the same house each summer.  Some of the book was interesting, but overall I found it very dull and slow moving.  I was not motivated by the family or the story to read further, and I would have been satisfied with a 4 page article on this subject matter in "The New Yorker" or "Old House Journal".   I got 75% through the book and realized there was no real plot twist waiting in the next chapter.  So I donated it to my local public library.   That said, it seems plenty of reviewers who have summer homes at Cape Cod loved this book.  
 A major problem with this spinner is that the mechanism, which sits in the middle of the bowl and touches the lettuce, is not submersible or dishwasher safe.  This means that you cannot thoroughly clean it.  I had to return it 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 I picked up this book in a half-price bin at Powell's in Portland. In the end, I had to laugh, because the sex, drugs, and rock n roll she describes in the sororities is nothing new. Heck, every DORM at the Pacific Northwest school I attended was full of sex, booze, drugs, and partying too--you didn't need to join the Greek system to pass out drunk every weekend! The point is, is it any shock that college-age girls are drinking and having sex while in the Greek system? Of course not. Therefore, the whole book is anti-climatic. This stuff is happening in high school. College? Big deal. Partying is half the reason why you go to college for! There's a famous saying: "Want an education? Go to a library. Want to party? Go to college." 350+ pages on something we all know is going on. Pfft 
 This was a good Mary J album, but it was not a Mary J Blige album: Only two songs really rocked: it's on and seven days, everything else was okay. I say down load to the two songs and keep rolling. 
 ...this movie is a dud. Who'd have thought that John Wayne and the director of "Support Your Local Sherrif" would have joined forces for this stinker!  The characterization hints at being good, but really its character actors doing what they do best - being good support characters. Its a good thing to because the Duke really just mailed this one  in.  First - what this movie does well:  -Ann Margaret is good and she looks great dressed up like a cowboy.  -the supporting cowboy characters literally steal the show.  -it is interesting that the bad guys chasing Ann Margaret and John Wayne and his cast of cronies are never ever seen close up until the very end. When you get to the end, you learn why, but it works well to keep them faceless.  -the last 10 minutes is good - top notch with a twister of an ending.  HOWEVER, what is wrong with the movie is stronger than what is right:  -John Wayne is absolutely uninspired - he is just a cardboard version of himself - a cranky, mean man who they rarely even try to develop as a character - and when they do, it seems very, very clunky.  -At least 20 minutes of this movie consists of long-distance shots of people riding horses. Sometimes, they ride over hills, sometimes they ride through valleys. We get 4 separate long shots of them crossing a wide pond that is supposed to be the Rio Grande (the border with Mexico). Fill in this time with some character development! Some dialogue! Anything!  -the character actors keep referring to other events in the past that sound a lot more interesting than this movie.  All in all, it seems like this was the rough draft of a great script that was rushed to film just so John Wayne could have another movie in the theaters. Too bad, a crack team of writers could have made it something special.  My suggestion, get "Cowboys" or either of the two "Rooster Cogburn" movies or "Support Your Local Sherrif" and see this actor and this director doing much better work! 
 I got it a few weeks ago. Although the light turned on in the charger (indicating the electrical socket is good), my shuffle only briefly flickered its charging/LED light.   I played around with it, but it seems it can't maintain contact and charge despite many attempts over several days.  I gave up and simply use my usb charger (with the stable base) hooked up to my laptop 
 I am on the last leg of this book, much to my relief.  It is terribly over-written, redundant and irritating to read. Jentz could learn a few lessons from Capote about creating a compelling narrative with an economy of words.  Ever meet one of those people who insist on telling you in great excrutiating detail about how they were wronged?  How every nuance, ambiguity and off-hand comment was a significant episode in their victimization? Even if they are factual, you reach a point where you just don't care anymore.  Jentz went through an unbelievable horrible experience.  Her recounting of the experience, is barely readable.  Go buy In Cold Blood and read it again 
 This book for the lack of a better word was cheesy. I read my first Danielle Steel book a few weeks ago (Malice) and was really impressed. I decided to grab another thinking it would be good as well. This book was slow and the brokenhearted story line dragged on forever. On top of that the main character was such a whiney complainer and that I couldn't stand even reading about him. This book was bad and extremely predictable. BIG DISSAPOINTMENT 
 Saved the book for my flight hoping for escape from seatbacks and crying babies.  Alas, the introspective, detached narrative of some genuine losers didn't provide the hoped for transendance.  That's not to say it's not beautifully, craftily written.  Even poetic 
 When I saw this book, i thought it was a good book for me.  but when  i began to read it (after i bought it), i noticed something that i hadn't before: this was a woman's book.  and not only a womens book, but a businesss  womens book.  i am not a woman, nor am i a business person, so i couldn't relate to the author AT ALL.  So, I wouldn't recomend this book to boys, guys, or men; nor would i recomend it to women that can't relate to business-type stuff (which i can't).  i feel bad that i wasted my money on a book written for the oppisite sex, but oh well... it was bargain price! My ratings is innaccurate for the appropiate adience of this book, though... 
 I borrowed this book from the library, as I have been very hesitant to spend the money on Cat Who books lately.  This one has set the seal on it, though...I don't even want to read them any more.  Even Koko and Yum Yum have been made totally uninteresting.  This is a series which should have retired on a positive note because so many people enjoyed it.  Instead, the publisher has run it into the ground through sheer incompetence.  I hope there is some poor lowly soul at Putnam whose job it is to read customer feedback and pass it on to the fools in charge...maybe they will finally let this series rest in piece 
 Rhea Perlman, a short white woman, is going to teach basketball to her towering Black high school students. And even though she knows nothing about hasketball she can still turn them into winners because she's White and sensitive and wants to be their "sistah." Gag me. This whole movie is completely insulting to people of all races. The director seems so sure he can sell a hip-hop basketball movie this bad to "those people" that he doesn't even bother to hide his apparent distaste for them. Avoid at all costs 
 No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.  The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?  To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
 This is a book that truly disappoints. The story itself is adequate, but not great. There is more than enough to keep you interested, but it's almost as if the publisher told the author, "OK, that's enough. End it." The book ends with an epilogue that attempts to tie up all the loose ends of the story. Unfortunately, the ending is much too ridiculous to be believable. This is definitely a 'don't buy' book. Get it from a friend or the library. Maybe you won't be as disappointed as I was 
 Too bad there isn't a 0 star rating. This was simply awful.  I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years - waded though a lot of her semi-readable stuff - waiting for another decent installment.  But I give up.  No more Kaye Scarpetta for me.  This book cured me - for good 
 I was very disappointed. The acting by the principles was fine, but I think the only thing that saved this movie for me was the choreography by Bob Fosse. I think what really turned me off was the omission of a few great songs. The following tunes from the original show were left out - Near To You, We've Got To Think About the Game, A Man Doesn't Know. And Applegate's tune, The Good Old Days, was abridged. A new tune, There's Something About an Empty Chair, was added to replace Near To You, but it was very weak. I wish someone would remake this wonderful show as they've done recently with Music Man and Bye Bye Birdie 
 I ordered this item with the hope of finding a new home for my ever-growing collection of credit cards, grocery store cards, insurance cards, club cards, hotel cards, airline cards... you get the point.  I was disappointed to discover that placing more than one card in the wallet prevents the "Accardion" from collapsing enough to zip close.  I can't imagine how such a defective design would ever have made it to market.  Unless you want a really large leather case for a single credit card, I would not recommend this product 
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 I think this book has amazing potential- the plot lines are intriguing, and the characters are interesting- but it falls far short of what I anticipated.  Phillips' prose simply does not draw the reader in.  Instead, it is dry and boring, and it becomes incredibly difficult to get through the long, uninteresting passages to find the good parts.  While I think that many readers will enjoy this book because of the powerful plot line, it seemed to me as though the book relied too much on plot and not enough on quality writing 
 I understand that some terms are well-known, but in 1998, to use the term "nigger in the woodpile" in quotes or not does not ride well with me.  I have to read a handout from this book for a class. Had I bought the book, I would've returned it. But since I cannot return copies, I guess I'm stuck with it, but I will be complaining to my teacher about the use of this handout 
 I could not help but to watch this film with all of my African American female sensibilities. Despite the proficient acting, cinematography and directing, I found the content highly offensive and trite. Mr. Kinksy claimed to love Shanduri and was willing to do anything to possess her affections. He was put off to find out that Shanduri was married, but not deterred. Shanduri gave him what she believed was an unattainable challenge to have her husband, who was arrested for speaking out against the government, freed from an African prison. I recognize that it is possible for a servant to fall in love with her employer, however I know that it is extremely rare. (Ask any black woman who's cleaned a white person's house, `how much love do you have for your boss.' The relationship between Shanduri and Mr. Kinksy was one of abuse of power and emotional manipulation. During the `relationship' that I watched develop, not once did Shanduri refer to her employer by his first name. Clearly indicating an uneven balance of power and control...not much different from a slave owner offering to free his children born to his African concubine. So, Mr. Kinksy gave up some of his prized possessions; it was European influence that created the climate that allowed Shanduri's husband to be detained indefinitely. Though I am one among several with a different review about the film, I have no reason to forget the long history of abuse past and present that women of color experienced at the hands of white people, especially white men. To see such a film is an insult and another example of how Europeans do not understand the masses of African Americans 
 What age range is the book appropriate for?  Poor Horton -- They beat him.  They maul him.  And try to cage him.  And threaten to boil the dust speck in Beezle-Nut juice just to teach him a lesson.  My poor 5 year old looked at me with sad eyes, and asked, "why?"  Not the best bed-time story 
 Almost the entire book is written in question and answer format! I heard about this book on Janet Parcel's radio show and it sounds like the Dr. knows what he is talking about, but the book is not user friendly due to the format.  I was hoping for some in depth detail about herbs and supplements, but that is not what this book is about. Very disappointed...  :- 
 I'm sure you've read the plot synopsis by now, so I'll skip it and get to the real review.  This book is a long, contrived, boring piece of unrealistic drivel.  This guy went to Harvard?  It reads like an Encyclopedia Brown mystery, except you figure it all out much quicker.  The characters are underdeveloped and frighteningly unrealistic (not to mention just plain stupid.  It took them 400 pages to figure out what was going on?  Maybe they went to Harvard, too).  Evidently, in Dr. Cook's world nobody ever utters an obscenity or does anything risque or more involved than "making love."  We get pages and pages about a man having an affair with his business associate, been when it comes to the pivotal moment the experience is summed up in two words.  Sounds like Cook is as prudish as his main characters.  Skip this book unless you enjoy mind-bogglingly bad literature (a la "Mystery Science Theater 3000", perhaps).  This is my first, and last, Robin Cook novel 
 I really want to give 2.5 stars. It's really just sort of a dry, rote listing of every control on every rack device. The examples lack aesthetics and interest. A lot of the better info is tucked away among the odd collection of sidebars, captions and block quotes. The illustrations are likewise offset from context and in funny formats. Typically, the illustration for the point in the text is several paragraphs later in the book. Also there are a lot of partial shots of the interface so you sort of have to track down the area of the device interface the book references. It's just a petty annoyance, no worse.  The info that's in there is accurate, and that's good, but it is neither in an easily referenced format, nor a format that would cause tidbits to stick in your memory. It's just sort of "there". I'm still reading it cover-to-cover because, well, I paid for it so I may as well get all I can out of it.   There are much more entertaining and stimulating books out there -- one which even has the word "Power" in its title, too. 
 Term Limits is so bad, it should become a pop culture icon ala Rocky Horror Picture Show; fans should be made to wear strange clothing and recite the worst passages to music at midnight. It's so bad that by the end, the act of reading has become blatant rubber-necking - ooh, wow, did you see that?  Ugh!   The writing is amateurish at best.  The author's favorite action verb is 'grab' and he uses it repeatedly in scenes ranging from the mundane (the grabbing of keys and doorknobs) to the romantic (the grabbing of hands and other body parts).  Similes and metaphors are conspicuously absent, but there are plenty of adverbs and adverbial phrases to fill the gap.   The author switches back and forth between referring to his characters by their first and their last names; sometimes he uses one and then - in the very next sentence! - the other. "Michael grabbed her by the shoulders and turned her around. O'Rourke saw the tears in her eyes and tried to put his arms around her..."  He makes many grammatical errors, the most irritating of which is the substitution of 'that' for 'who' consistently ["Congressman O'Rourke received this tape earlier today along with a letter from the assassins that were responsible for killing..."]  The dialogue is stilted and clunky - at the lowest point, he has his assassin ask another character to tell him what has 'transpired' since last they talked.  Rather than simply 'saying' things, the characters yell, shout and scream them, resulting in the unfortunate image of the president of the United States waxing shrill and screechy at his chief of staff.  The plot is neither plausible nor compelling.  The protaganists include a bunch of renegade CIA operatives who murder 'bad' politicians, and a Congressman who approves of these actions and even helps to kidnap and murder a 'bad' retired CIA black ops director.  The antagonists include the aforementioned black ops director, the head of the national security agency, and the bumbling and ridiculous White House chief of staff.  The demand made by the 'good' assassins, following their murder of four prominent politicians, is that the president present a BALANCED BUDGET with NO NEW TAXES to the Congress!  Our intrepid hero-Congressman finds this a worthy cause, and when some 'good' politicans (i.e. the sort who push for the balanced budget idea) are murdered, he is inspired to wreak some violence of his own.  No one, whether they be protagonist or antagonist, seems to possess a moral compass.  'Bad' guys can be murdered indiscriminately and no consequences will be applied; the murder of a 'good' guy may be avenged, again, without consequence. The climax and its aftermath are laughably bad; of course, I can't reveal the ending, but let me just point out that the climax begins with a bunch of CIA operatives sneaking into a house by jumping out of a helicopter hovering overhead.  Apparently, this is some kind of silent helicopter, because the people inside the house were unaware of its presence.  That this book was published at all, much less that it received initial printings large enough to place it on the bestseller list, is emblematic of everything that has gone wrong with publishing.  It stands as a slap in the face to every talented writer in the country. 
 Man, have I given this guy a chance.  Multiple chances.  Listened to the CDs, saw the big HBO special.  I mean, his career is red hot now.  He clearly has lots of fans.  Mostly college age (perhaps this should be a warning to some of you).  All I can say is "maybe they'll grow out of it."  He is NOT funny.  His act has no bite, no point of view, no opinion/viewpoint at all.  His comedy consists of spewing observations his audience can relate to (the "this is all happened to us" or "has this ever happened to you?" school of humor).  He runs about manically, acting out every little word that comes out of his mouth (for those in the audience that may not be so good with words).  His fans acknowledge that, yes, they can relate.  "Yeah!  That's happened to me!"  "I know that reference!'  They laugh, cheer, clap, and plunk down their hard-earned dollars for his vanilla wit.  He never actually COMMENTS on the things he discusses in any intelligent, interesting way.  He has no edge.  He's not outraged by anything.  He's cute 'n' cuddly.  Richard Pryor must be rolling in his grave at the very fact that Cook is classified as a stand up comic.  "Pryor?  The guy writing this must be OLD!'  Okay, try this on for size:  Chris Rock is good comedy.  Same with Dave Chappelle.  Carlin.  Laura Kightlinger.  Kinison.  Rodney Dangerfield.  Bob Saget.  Gilbert Gottfried.  Dom Irrera.  Lewis Black.  Robert Klein.  The late Mitch Hedberg.  Jim Norton.  Patton Oswalt.  Brian Posehn.  DeGeneres.  Jon Stewart.  Bob & David.  The UCB.  I'm not even a big fan of Sarah Silverman, but at least she's trying to bring something different to the party.  Anything but this!  God help us.  Let's hope he goes the way of Carrot Top and Dice soon (don't forget, Cook fans, Mr. Top and Mr. Clay were once as popular as your boy here) 
      I had high hopes for this book since I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud while reading Bryson's 'In a Sunburned Country'. I was more than a little disappointed after finished `Lost Continent' I came away feeling more than a little disappointed.      Before I bought this book I was puzzled at the contrasting reviews here and I initially took the most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I figured these were written by people who mostly just took offense way too easily and were unable to laugh at themselves as Americans. I have to say though, after reading the book I find myself agreeing with some of the negative reviews of this book.       First off, as an American that has lived overseas for 3 years now, I feel I'm more than capable of looking at America with an objective eye. I'm completely aware of America's many shortcomings - ie.  the propensity for urban sprawl, the seemingly declining interest in it's rich history, the ever growing dependence on technology and increasing laziness that invariably comes with it etc. etc.     Having said that, I still regard this book primarily as just one endless, tiring, repetitive rant by an unhappy man. One would be hard pressed to find more than a couple instances where Bryson spent more than three of four sentences at a time describing anything he found ENJOYABLE. As one reviewer pointed out, Bryson comes across as being exactly like the kind of people he constantly complains about in this book...rude, ignorant, and, just like Bryson himself, overweight (apparently he hasn't stepped in front of a mirror lately). One has to wonder why someone would put out a book that is so consistently sour in tone. If I had just finished such a thoroughly unsatisfying and unhappy trek as this, I would be hard pressed to come up with a good reason (other than a quick buck perhaps) to actually write a book about it. Let me get one thing straight, if this were a book about Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. I would feel the same way. Yes, there are a few funny passages in his book, but his air of superiority along with the overuse of metaphors pretty much dampen it at times. As demonstrated in `In a Sunburned Country', his strength lies in sharing facts and history of the places he finds himself in, and the humor is always much more engaging when it isn't over the top and written as if he's trying to impress himself.        There was a span of about 12 years between the writing of `Lost Continent' and `In a Sunburned Country', and it shows. This is a younger Bryson, a man who seems to have a problem with every little detail, and it becomes increasingly tedious and irritating as the book goes on. He rarely displays anything other than contempt for the places he finds himself in. A couple of other reviewers also made valid points when they found it curious that (with the exception of his Iowa drug buddy) he never manages to engage anyone in anything resembling a meaningful conversation to actually get a handle on their mindset (as he did in "In A Sunburned Country' for instance). His interactions with locals are mostly limited to ordering food at local restaurants and asking for directions. He seems perfectly content coming to conclusions about entire groups of people based on no real substance and communication whatsoever.       In this book, sadly, he comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic, anti-social loner with a bone to pick with just about everyone and everything. Any remotely kind words he has about anything (and they are few and far between) are all but smothered by the sour tone of the book as a whole. I SO wish I could recommend this book for others to read, but I'd be lying if I said it's time well spent 
 This product did absolutely nothing for the puffiness around my eyes.   I had much better results with a generic version of Strivectin-D for eyes.  I don't have dark circles (thankfully) so I can't address that aspect 
 While this book is a good attempt at placing statistical topics necessary to toxicology in one spot, the mistakes are inexcusable.  Many formula are incorrect as well as text referring to the wrong tables or data. Therefore, one begins to lose trust in the information presented.  Be careful if you use this book 
 All of his music sounds the sam 
 It's time to retire this old book which is amazingly rigid in its decorating ideas and its school-marmish, rules-oriented approach to design. Decorating today is so personal, yet Martha (or this old book, anyway) seems to think that there is only one way to do things. It reminds me of a 1950s book filled with rules for the little housewife to follow, but it certainly doesn't fit the world of today's educated, style-conscious, and confident consumer. Bleah 
 One of the many problems with this book is the order in which the topics are presented.  Right off the bat, They decide to put linear equations ahead of all other types of DE's.  Are they really as simple to solve as seperable equations?  The entire second chapter is a complete mess and is very disorganized.  The forumla for the integrating factor of linear equations is difficult to ascertain, and it is never clearly stated (it's there, but their notation is convoluted).  I don't want to sound like someone who is just having difficulty with the math taking it out on the innocent textbook.    I have consulted other textbooks on the topic, and I have to say that I really like Zill's DE's for the logical way in which it is organized, and    Kohler and Johnson's text for its clear explanations.  My professor actually commented on how bad this book is.  All DE textbooks are NOT created equally, and if you are struggling through this one, try finding older editions of those other two from your University's library.    
  King at his worst.  Stephen King has produced works of utter genius but this is one to avoid. It is rambling, egotistical conceited.  
 I read a book by Donald Goines about a raped woman and the whole time I was reading it, I was thinking "Why in the world would someone write a book like this?" As much as I love all of Flake's other books, that's the exact same thing I was thinking about this book. The book started off very interesting about how one brother deals with another brother's death, and it reminded me of a cousin which gave me good and bad memories. But then the book launched off into this twisted relationship between the living brother and his father. This book deeply disturbed me during the camping "results" and after that it just became so off-the-wall.  I started questioning my donations to homeless people and who really needs it.  I can't say the book was bad...it just wasn't for me...and definitely an extreme difference from the other books that I've read by Flake 
 This would be a great book with a large number of food items analyzed, but it doesn't include the fiber information, something that can be very important to a diabetic since fiber can have a positive effect on blood sugar and cholesterol.  I was going to return it, but it isn't worth it, so I just ordered The Complete Book of Food Counts by Corinne T. Netzer which has all the information needed 
 Mr. Erasmus's book is possibly the most widely known book on the subject of fats.   Unfortunately, the book's wide currency and authoritative stance does not hold up in light of crucial facts.  It contains a lot of awesome scientific formulas, tables, analyses, and so forth, and would appear to be an authoritative, definitive "final answer" on fats, but there is much in it that is alarmingly inaccurate and misleading. His conclusions on polyunsaturates, saturated fats, coconut oil, butter, flax and canola oil are all haphazard and inconsistent with fact-based science (For example, read the findings of Sally Fallon and Mary G. Enig in their document on canola oil: http[...]).  Much of Erasmus's conclusions, especially about vegetable based polyunsaturates, reflect current dietary trends than anything else. Hemp oil, which he espouses, contains cannabinoids, the compounds found in marijuana: people eating hemp oil have failed a clean test for drugs in corporation testing. Moreover, the book promotes manufactured oils which Mr. Erasmus utilizes in his very expensive oil blend, which are high in polyunsaturates.   For true science and data on fats, one would be better to turn to Mary G. Enig's "Know Your Fats," which is the real, pioneering guide on fats. Enig is one of the world's foremost lipid biochemists, and she provides specific science and how fats work in the body and what the body needs. Also of value is her book 'Eat Fat Lose Fat' and Bruce Fife's 'The Coconut Oil Miracle,' which despels a lot of the myths regarding saturated and tropical fats. Erasmus provides very little information about the properties of coconut oil. Enig and Fife present common sense and scientific logic in their research and delivering of facts, something which is lacking in Erasmus's book. Enig is clear, and consistent from beginning to end: Erasmus's stand is contradictory.    
 Although I have read all of Rice's books and know that although a few have been great most are a disappointment.  This was not the exception.  She took the greatest story ever told and turned it into the slowest read ever read.  I recognized the clay pigeons as a gnostic tale given no creedence by scholars.  Mother Mary as having not been the mother to James and other siblings as being a unique Catholic teaching. I think this could have been made a fascinating novel but because it drags on with the child Jesus who knows nothing and is so unaware of His purpose on earth, I found it painfully far from true.  The last few pages turn mildly interesting not unlike other very slow novels by Rice. I just read 6 Big Big Big Angels by Mary Jo Pennington yesterday and read it in just a few hours because of the fascinting descriptions of God the Father & Jesus.  Anne Rice's novel I took 3 weeks to complete because it was so uninspiring 
  Unfortunately, not as good as I hoped and not what it promised to be.   Plus, he was arrested for burning an American flag at a college campus - after all that he's done and what has been done for him.   Very unfortunate. 
 Lev Manovich claims to have been trained in computer science. If he had any respect for the field, he would not have filled his book with deliberate misstatements about the nature of digital media. He uses these misstatements to fill out his narrative about the development of new media, and in doing so misinforms the "new media artists" he purports to educate.  The writing is reflective of Manovich's speaking/lecturing style: factually lazy, fluffed up with pointlessly obtuse language, and above all else BORING.   If you are an artist looking to understand the development of new media, look elsewhere, as you will only be bored and misinformed by Manovich. If you are a computer scientist looking for media theory, you will also be bored, but also possibly offended by the lazy treatment of your area of expertise 
 HORRIBLE! The dialogue is extra stupid and corny and the storyline extra empty and the cussing extra filthy..I have read all the UNDEAD books but this is the worst..I think MaryJanice wrote this one on the can~ 
 Send in your query or your three chapters to fifty of these guys and then wait.  First, they don't want to read them.  They hire someone to do this task.  They don't want to do it either.  They send you their rejection card and don't even acknowledge the title of your book.  Once they did. Now they're too many of you.  They do get shills to write good things about their own published book because they want the expectant writer to buy it.  That's how they make money.  You must have a contact with a publisher or an agent or they won't touch your stuff.  Even Hemingway was going nowhere until Scott Fitzgarald reccommended him.  Enough though of opinion.  Ask anyone that you know who is an aspiring writer if they ever got a positive response from an agent.  Michael Blake "Dances With Wolves" never got an agent until Costner said he was going to make the movie.  Even then it was like pulling rotting teeth.  The publishers sent regection after rejection until Blake sold it for $5,000 (to be published in paperback)with a $1,000 bonus if the picture was actually released.  He had given up writing after 35 years when "Dances" sold.  But who did he have to know...Kevin Costner of all people.  Another agent, not Blake's, said he had only taken one client on in one year and only because the guy sent him a bottle of French wine.  He liked French wine.  Go to the agent.  (How badly do you want to be published?) Talk to the agent.  Find out if they are even in the neighborhood of what it is that you're writing.  Call publishers.  Talk to their assistants.  They'll talk to you if you keep it short.  Find out what they really want.  Go to the library or the internet but don't encourage these "Write and be published authors."  They are conning you.  None of these agents have the slightest intention of reading your chapters.  Anyway, one way or the other you will find out.  Don't use someone else unless you have an "in;" be your own agent.  Good luck you writers.  Some of you are great and are anguished over nothing.  You will succeed.  Do it yourself and don't forget foreign publishers that publish in English.  They will read your stuff. For heaven's sake's don't just sit there! Good hunting!  
 This is a great CD...in its original language!!!  NEK is an Italian singer.  I'd love to buy this CD, but not in a spanish cover 
 I actually returned this book because it had very little , if anything, to do with WHY you actually compulsively eat. it did not go into or even explained the psychological factors that influence C.O. all this book talk about is how women's self-image is polluted with diet ads etc, etc. it does not deal at all with how to actually stop, in an effective way.   same thing as Overcoming Overeating. the whole point of the book is to stop dieting and to stop having a dieting mentality. also it doe snot deal with the actual cause of you overeating ( which is not dieting)   if you really want to overcome overeating and end your obsession with food, you need to know why you are physiologically addicted to food. why you find so much pleasure in it. and for that you have to read books with substantial research, not just a feminist sound-off.   read : the pleasure trap, LIfe is hard- food is easy , to name a few good ones.   but this one and her other one won't help you at all. 
 I am speechless. I am without speech. One of the worst movies in the world. Every frame of this movie sucks. It is unbelievably DUMB. 
 Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the "hero" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being?  And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack).  Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms.  Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves "ironic", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism.   Is this film an accurate portrayal of them?  Yes, in some ways.  Is the film worth watching?  Yeah, at least once.  Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth.  This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays. Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film.    
 I couldn't finish The Evening of the Holiday.  It was Hazzard's first novel, and it shows: immature, boring.  It does not capture a sense of place and time as well as the other two Hazzard books I read.  To put things in perspective, I gave The Great Fire 4 stars, and would consider The Bay of Noon a 3 star book 
 You can eat when your hungry and stop when you are satisfied and still not lose weight if you are eating mostly the wrong kinds of foods.  It was only when I started eating right(lots of fruits and vegetables and whole grains)that I started losing weight!!!  I also found that when I started eating the fruits and vegetables that I didn't crave the bad things (candy and chips)so much.  
 I bought this book to try to learn some useful poses for my subjects, and given most other people's ratings, I decided to give it a try.  However, upon opening the book my first thought was, "these all look like high school yearbook photos", which is exacltly what they are.  It seems that that's primarily what type of photography the author does and his book is geared almost exclusively to that market.  His main concern, which he stresses throughout the book, is creating a "saleable picture", and he keeps emphasizing the importance of pleasing mom, since she's usually the one with final say over the pictures.  A better title for this book would have been, "How To Take High School Senior Pictures".  Even then, most of the pictures are not very good, both in their original execution and in their print quality for this book. In addition, the poses are unnatural and awkward looking, and the book is filled with typos and grammatical errors.  To be fair, the author does suggest some useful basics of things to do and things not to do when posing a subject, but there is really very little useful information here.  So, if you're interested in learning how to take pictures that look like a Sears portrait, this may be the book for you.  However, if you really want to learn some useful techniques for posing your subjects in a more natural or more artistic manner, I'd steer clear of this book 
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 I love jockey underwear.  I've bought this brand for years, because of the great fit, the long wear, and the fact that it's 100% cotton (I love natural stuff).  I bought a pack recently and was dismayed to discover that Jockey has added a very overwhelming "baby-powder" scent to the product (what's the point of 100% cotton when you add chemicals to the fabric?).  Repeated washings have not removed the smell.  I will have to dispose of the underwear.  I am extremely allergic to anything perfumed or scented.  MAYBE JOCKEY CAN LABEL THEIR PRODUCTS "SCENTED," OR "UNSCENTED?"  (Regular bathing is a better alternative to "scented" underwear, anyway. 
 I have read Webber's book for a class, and I generally was not impressed. His arguments for returning to the Ancient church (he defines from 100-600AD) I don't think hold up.  He thinks that the Ancient church is the solution to post-modernism, and he seems to naively present that period, as if it did not have any problems. But we know that it was full of debates on theology.  Can we also go back to the Ancient church? Even though some people call this period post-modern, we have not given up all the attributes of modern thinking. We are still highly critical thinkers. I am starting to think that hyper-modern is a better name for this period.   Webber is more interested in the practices after the NT was written, than he is about thinking about the church as it is described in the NT. Yes the church in Acts and the Epistles was in flux trying to find it's way, but wouldn't Paul be more better to read and thought about, than the people and structures after the apostles? What ever happened to confidence in scripture? Surely it is more trustworthy than the Ancient church 
 This book was recommended for me by Amazon and I am glad I took it out from the library instead of buying it. It took me a long time to get through the book and I found that I forced myself to finish reading it. The main character is hard to relate to or even sympathize with. And at the end of the book I feel that nothing has been resolved. I would not recommend this book. 
 Is there an option for zero.  The worst I book I have ever read.  He contradicts himself in his points, hoovers over stealing pears (and other evil things) and puts me to sleep.  I don't see how this piece of garbage could make anyone a saint, it should be burned. ZERO STARS 
 I bought this frame in Jan. '07 and the screen burned out March '07.  I returned it and the newest one burned out last night - April '07.  This product needs a redesign - the screens don't work for long. 
 "Three pigs" in particular, with characters Leo and Nina, is really pretty bad. I don't know how Prose has established such a reputation, but I know I don't want to read any more. Her lack of  conceptualizing a work at the beginning, of being unable to make fiction  beyond the tiresome and hideously predictable musings of these characters,  really attests to mediocrity, not brilliance 
 Nice looking but with very serious design and/or manufacturing flaw - after LESS THAN 2 month of use in office environment glass CRACKED WITHOUT ANY IMPACT whatsoever. Now I'll have to find out if Skagen's customer service is any good. For $70 watch I certainly expected better quality. After reading other reviews for this models I realized that many other people had the same issue.  BOTTOM LINE -AVOID!! 
 "Hedda Gabler" has to be one of the most boring plays I have ever read.  If you're looking for action in a play, then stay away from this one.  Henrik Ibsen's "A Doll House" was mesmerizing and captivating, and this play is the exact opposite.  There was no point to the plot and the ending served no purpose.  Hedda was bored - that's the point; just shameful.  I do not recommend 
 Wuthering Heights the novel grabs you at the first page and drags you through passion, betrayal, madness, despair, greed, hatred, and revenge. It's not necessarily a pleasant read, but always an engrossing one. Emily Bronte's characters jump off the page and will continue to haunt you long after you've finished the book.   Modern day moviemakers have had a notoriously bad time translating any of the Bronte sisters' works into film and this is no exception. The characters are representations in name only and fail to capture any of the true spirit behind this amazing book. Juliet Binoche and Ralph Fiennes are two of the best actors working in film today, but this movie is a definite low point for both.    As Heathcliff and Catherine, Fiennes and Binoche seem to have failed to grasp the depth or the passions of the characters and their performances are flat and bland. Binoche's personality is too grounded and mature for the wild and carefree Cathy so she compensates with endless giggling that got on my nerves. Fiennes comes across as greasy and sullen instead of a tormented and complex soul; he simply does not have the charisma or the depth to play such a demanding role. The other characters are likewise lacking in realism, only Janet McTeer fares well, she is fabulous as Ellen Dean.   Even if the acting were better, the story does not capture the essence of the book. Everything moves too quickly, the film jumps around frequently and large plot holes are left either unexplained or are patched quickly with a few brusque words. Sinead O'Conner's appearance as Emily Bronte to bookend the film is contrived and unnecessary.  This film was very obviously made on a budget and the sets and costumes show it. The wigs are dreadful and the costumes are for the most part, ugly and unflattering. Fiennes actually looks potbellied in some of his vests!   Maybe someday someone will make a film that does this remarkable book justice. This isn't it 
 This CD contains: 2 long remixes of The Hand That Feeds, the orginal song, and the music video.   The two remixes on this CD sound exactly the same and aren't all that good. It comes with the orginal version of the song "The Hand That Feeds" and also the music video (but in terrible quality). So you're basically buying 1 bad remix.  This is one of the worst NIN remix CDs I've ever heard. If you're not a hardcore fan (meaning, you don't own every Halo) then don't waste your time with this CD 
 To call this a collection of Victorian erotica is inaccurate as this implies that all the stories are from that era. I felt rather cheated to realise that a few were obviously twentieth century additions. It might have been more accurate to have titled this a Collection of 18th -20th Century Erotic 
 The last time Kurupt was in dire straits, Tha Streetz Iz a Mutha surfaced as a brilliant, vengeful album packed with melodic Fred Wreck and Dr. Dre production, and Young Gotti's verbal piss and vinegar. Four years later, Kurupt's stranded on Death Row, and his rare interviews have alluded to another chapter of inner-turmoil. This album has been toted and pushed back for three of those years. As Kurupt's future seems brighter through a Dogg Pound reunion, the solo - Against Tha Grain (Death Row) arrives unexpected, unannounced, and clearly under-dressed for Hip-Hop's better MCs in 2005.   "Deep Dishes" reveals a new bottom in Kurupt's lyrics. "You ain't got weapons of mass destruction on you / And I'm gonna make sure you leak like barrels of oil," is not only a awkward rhyme, but one of many analogies to terrorism and the Holocaust for street-success. The attitude is polarized between death-threatening lyrics of pained animosity ("Speak On It" and "Jealousy") to olive-branch offerings of peace, "Tha Past." Perhaps this reveals either Kurupt's own uncertainty of his friends, or a poorly thought-out compilation from four years of masters. Whichever, Kurupt's sincerity on either side is lost, leaving only the weaker party songs to be taken seriously.   Without any of his former associates willing to support this effort, Kurupt's production falters greatly. Sir Jinx, the man who helped Ice Cube so greatly, can't do the same for Kurupt. "Stalkin'" uses a cliche drum sample to build momentum, but the effort fails due to lack of purpose. Mark Sparks does the bulk of the album, without any stand out surprises. The most refreshing backdrop comes on "Calico," with the Dayton Family, produced by The Screwface Music Group. Here, Kurupt isn't given watered down and bastardized G-Funk, but hard drums and well-structured keys. Another collaborative highlight is the promised junction of Kurupt and Domination. "You F**kin' With the Best" does reveal positive chemistry with another, as the Eastwood, Spider Locc, and M.O.P. bonds failed to. Still, Baby C-Style's production isn't as edgy as the collaboration. Like the inconsistent messages in the words, the music on this album feels as though radio play was never a consideration of the project.   Against Tha Grain defies all of the promises of a Kurupt lyrical revival. The first artist-album on Death Row in over five years continues to rely on recycled Tupac material ("My Homeboys"). The mix of anonymous threats and peace offerings fall on deaf ears, as does music contributed by unenthused, uninspired no-names. With a Dogg Pound reunion album already in utero, Kurupt must consider his now higher wall to climb back to mainstream consciousness and present-day respect. The grains got the best of him. 
 First, let me say that I whole-hearedly agree with the review by Tiberius. Back in the glory days of Counter-Strike (2001-2002), this game was the be-all end-all for 1) Online video games, 2) First-Person Shooters, 3) PC Games, and 4) Any video game basically. It had real-life weapons, the graphics were superb at the time, the maps were extremely well-made, the system requirements are still obscenely low, and damnit it was fun. Then, inevitabely, the hands of time began to take their ruthless, indiscriminate toll. Video cards supported better graphics, new (and yes, better!) games came out (Battlefield 1942, Unreal Tournament 2004), hacking became the unmistakable poison of Counter-Strike, and a lot of the cool, casual gamers grew up or moved on. From 2000 to 2004, Counter-Strike went from an utter joy to a sensation to a fading diamond to a nuisance. By 2004 to present day, it has become a problem. Great games and great game developers are losing tons of money because people are still playing this game after five years on their mom's worn-out 640 Megahertz Pentium III PCs running Windows 98. Counter-Strike is still one of the most popular games of all-time, with a ridiculous number of people playing it on average a day, because people just don't seem to have enough self-control to give up their hopeless addiction.  Today, server admins are, for the most part, humorless dictators, and will not stand for anything that deviates from this game's undeniable, monotonous drone. People are still playing the same maps from the 1.0 release, that have completely lost all their zest and initial potential. It always feels as if I've played the same round a thousand times before, and I probably have. Even the custom maps are sickening in their monotony. fy_iceworld is fun for 3 consecutive seconds. Many other popular custom maps in heavy server rotation are the same way, and all look disguisting. I've played on probably over 500 servers, and downloaded probably over the same amount of *quality* custom maps, and not more than 3 have I ever seen a server run in its rotation, or voted on by the players. Furthermore, people are still playing the game using dial-up, and CS veterans are always complaining about camping, even if its a tactic used to complete the objective. As far as the objectives are concerned, Counter-Strike has basically become a deathmatch game. No one will listen to anyone's plan (on the rare occasion there is one), no one tries to rescue the hostages, and everyone always calls someone a "p***y" or "nub" if you use the auto shotgun or AWP. And to top it all off, Valve cancelled the outstanding won.net and replaced it with this Steam garbage, a utility soaking wet with incompetence.  L337 Speak has also gained mass popularity to the jaded Counter-Strike culture, and has become its own incessant frustration. But I won't even get into that. If you're new to CS, don't bother, veterans of this game are far from friendly, and you'll probably get called a bunch of names involving lots of zeroes and threes if you're a beginner. For now, if you want to indulge yourself in a great online game, check out World of Warcraft, Battlefield 1942, Sven Co-Op, or even Team Fortress Classic (a dated game with an *awesome* community that has yet to lose its initial charm) 
 I have a problem with Bakke's idea of "fun."  Fun, by his definition is a free-for-all.  For example, he feels that an organization's "amount of fun" is determined by "the number of individuals allowed to make decisions" (99).  I agree that sharing information "reinforces the feeling of community" (98), but I don't agree with his suggestion that leaders should "ask for as much advice as possible before making a decision" (88).  "Sharing information" and "seeking advice" are two different things.    Bakke misuses the analogy of a child jumping into the arms of a parent by stating that the same is required of leaders to jump into the arms of the subordinate (103).  It is the subordinate who should trust the leader.  In one section of the book, he stresses the importance of "asking for as much advice as possible before making a decision."  But in another section he shares the story of his administrative assistant who "routinely checks with the office accountant to see how her decisions would affect the budget, but no higher approval is necessary" (apparently no other advice is needed as well) (79).  His idea of leadership lacks strength by decentralizing decision-making to others.   In his postscript, Bakke discusses Biblical leadership.  At first glance, what he writes sounds Biblical-"serve the people they lead," and "allow followers to use their talents effectively" (261), but his overall idea of leadership is not Biblical.  For instance, he says, "The Creation story does not assign people, even leaders, the responsibility of `managing' other people" (261)- I wonder what he thought God meant in Genesis 3:16 when He told Eve, "he will be your master."  The Bible doesn't use the word, "manage," but God entrusted leaders to people throughout the Bible-that's why there were judges in the OT.  I don't think the Israelites would've left the wilderness if Moses asked "as many as possible" before making a decision 
 This stuff does not work at all! I tried this because it was the only one of the lens repair solutions that didn't have negative feedback, save yourself money and do not buy this product. It looks just like nail polish and leaves the same kind of film on your lenses 
 If you are male, white, Republican, politically conservative, born before 1965, and have Andrew Jackson as your all time personal hero then by all means purchase this title.  I loved my copy so much I'm donating it to The Salvation Army.  
 This book is somewhat intriguing. It is indeed an authoritative  scholarly account of the growth of government in the United States, and for that reason only well worth reading. However, there is a pervading subtext of libertarian conspiracy theory about governmental power in the book that leaves the reader wondering if the author might not be masquerading a scholarly endeavour (that in itself is very rewarding) in order to suggest that government is the incarnation of evil. The fundamental truth which is developed here, that there is a permanent and necessary contradiction between the development of governmental power and individual liberty is unsophisticated, not to say outright crude. In addition, the author's thesis that after each crisis resulting in the growth of governmental capacities and power the government  (always conceptualized as a large undifferentiated whole in the book) tends to rationalize its subsequent business in order not to loose what it just gained is not a discovery of the highest order. This is the rule in every institutional setting, whether corporate or bureaucratic,  we know that since Max Weber's work on bureaucracy, without the libertarian hogwash 
 Oye huevones! If you liked the gutsy and catchy Control Machete with Fermin IV, then you probably will NOT like this CD. The writers now are obviously not as good as Fermin. There are no catchy tunes, the songs are monotonous and not interesting. Don't bother buying this 
 I have loved each and every one of Jane Hamilton's other novels and highly recommend them:  The Book of Ruth, A Map of the World, Short History of a Prince and Disobedience.  This book, sadly, does not rank among them.  It feels forced and uninteresting, with outlandish and unrecognizable characters and scenarios.  I've already paid for it, so I'll probably try to finish it, but don't waste your time or money.  Read another Hamilton instead 
 I didn't learn much from this book, and I don't think it was just me.  I'm afraid it is one of those books written by knowledgeable people for a general audience, without much understanding of who are in that audience or what they might want to know.  Example:  "Rumble is very low-frequency noise caused by acoustic feedback, tone arm resonance, motor vibration, and other problems in a turntable."  How many readers need to know what "rumble" means but already know about "acoustic feedback" and "tone arm resonance"?  And what are they meant to do with the information?  The discussion ends there.  Sorry to have to contradict the generally good reviews.  I notice, though, that they are mainly from other wizards who think somebody might benefit from the book -- not from people who actually have. 
 In the beginning, I thought this was the best novel that Sue Grafton had ever written.  There was a great plot, numerous twist and turns and just enjoyable reading.  Then the end of the book came and what a disappointment.  It was confusing and left you feeling that you had just wasted your time reading the book 
 I read Cameron Crowe's book a couple years ago, and it is head-and-shoulders above this.  What Charlotte essentially does in this "personal" biography is string together a long series of celebrity interviews into one barely coherent narrative.  One gets the distinct impression it was far more important for Charlotte to "get to know" these interview subjects than it was for her to write this book.  What makes me think that?  Perhaps it's the photos of Charlotte and several of her interviewees sprinkled throughout this book.  On the whole, "personal" seems to be shorthand for "lazy. 
 Let me qualify something.  I have a two year old.  This book is not good for a two year old.  Pictures: Poorly done, with some artistic watercolors that are really to dark.  Not a bright happy and pleasing in the illustration department.  The pictures are really elementary in skill level.  Story:  This book is really just a huge social message about the loss of habitat for certain animals.  I dont think that little kids really can conceptialize this let alone care.  The message also offers no solution to the problem.  Leaves you hanging at the end as you wonder if you missed something.  Text: Not a rhyming book.  Actually, just did not have good flow.  I hate to be the odd man out here, but for MY purposes - not a book that I would recommend you buy 
 There are some writers whose books are so, well, just plain bad, awful, terrible, dreadful, etc., etc., that they're a waste of perfectly good paper.    This is so bad--  It deserves to be blamed for global warming.    
 The Rainbow 600 count Egyptian sheets were so irregular that the seams on the pillowcases were not square. I returned them 
 My issue isn't so much with this physical book itself - the pictures are big and colorful, although often blurry for some reason - as much as it is with the architecture. Palladian windows and columns are classical elements, and building with brick and stone are classical materials, but architecture is all proportion. With the exception of the Julian Bicknell work, this book is largely haphazard attempts at making new buildings look old by throwing a lot of money at them. What is missing is the understanding of proportion - not just in the Palladian sense - but in the sense of the early 20th century American architects - Lindeberg, Delano & Aldrich, Trumbauer, Mellor, Meigs & Howe, Pope, Platt, and later Adler, etc. And you can throw Lutyens in the U.K. in there as well. Anyway, I guess I would say - you're not likely to learn much from this book, and that if you are interested in the houses that inspired this "new" Classicism, just stick with the aforementioned work 
 So you've got this photojournalist took a spill at the track and he's just lounging around with not a care in the world and what does he do but spy on innocent dames getting undressed like a super-perv. And he's already got this hot cupcake he's just giving the cold shoulder cuz she likes it, sick bobby-soxer. And this bloke wants all the broads in the apartment complex so when Perry Mason begins sniffing around for a date, George Bailey creates these fantasies involving murder and nighttime gardening. And the F-er actually gets away with it. And everyone crowns it a masterpiece because we celebrate voyeurism in this country. Why else do you think there are spy cameras everywhere? It's sickening and I'm not having any of it 
 If you are into the old childrens songs from the 50's, 60's, and 70's (you know the ones: they were played by your kindergarten teacher on a record player)- then this set of 4 disks are for you. Personally, I was hoping for something a little more modern. These all sound like they were recorded directly from a 45LP. Not the highest quality 
 It's not that the information insn't correct, but it certainly isn't insightful.  This seems like a mental exercise for a professor who just wants to get his name in print.  Right away you're in trouble becuase he has you go through an exercise and then rate your optimism to see if this book could help you.  if you are low on optimism, you need this book, if you are balanced, you need this book and if you are very optimistic, you still need this book.  My view, try to see things from others perspective and find out what your unique service and contribution is to a given situation and ulitmaley your whole life.  The rest will fall into place. 
  	The book Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage is about the economy and the impact one scientist had on the world with his predictions.  Hubbert's theory stated that in the early 1970's oil production would reach its highest level. He was doubted my many scientists, but when it came true scientists used it to look at what the future holds for oil production. It is expected to hit this decade at some point. This book describes the origin of oil and development over the many years. It also describes several different oil fields and the prosperity of them, and the different types of techniques and bits used to find oils by scientists. Each scientist has different methods of finding the oil fields, and they use data sets to record the sites and sizes of them. It provides an overview of what the future holds for oil production, and what different kinds of energy we can resort too if needed to avoid the economic troubles lying ahead. 	I thought this book was overall pretty boring. I wasn't  entertained or hooked on it, and it didn't make me want to keep reading in the end. I found it very confusing most of the time, and it had a lot of information to try to digest all at once, such as numbers and equations. It wasn't the kind of book I really get indulged in, and want to read more of, or cant put down.  	I would recommend this book to those who like to read books about our economy and what's going on in different industries. This book is easier to read for adults, as it contains advanced material that could confuse younger children. For those who enjoy reading advanced books about our economy or oil, this is an excellent book. 
 Unfortunately, Malphurs has again published a book that far underestimates his readers.  Advanced Strategic Planning does little more than lay out the basics of strategic planning; issues of greater consequence are left  untouched.  Dealing with entropy in an organization is a serious issue that  Malphurs seems to believe goes away if one's vision/goals/strategy are  rightly aligned.  I was disappointed with this book.  Better to wait for  Post-Advanced Strategic Planning 
 What the h--l were you thinking Mr. Fowles? In an effort to reclaim the time lost reading this opus, I'll be brief. Read every other Fowles title first, then after reading Maggot can you help me figure out what I read? Thanks in advance.  
 Don't get me wrong here,I love Smokey Robinson,or at least the Smokey Robinson that gave us Tracks of My Tears,Ooh Baby Baby,ect...This Smokey Robinson,however,is better left unheard...These standards have been sung BETTER by countless crooners and divas,from Sinatra,Torme,and Damone to Johnny Hartman and Arthur Prysock...Gutting the integrity of these songs in order to give them a sound that is different than any other interpretation that I have ever heard is not my idea of classic...Indeed,why did Robinson even bother recording these songs,as he was apparently determined NOT to allow them to sound anything like they were meant to sound...I have read that here,on Robinson's "standards"effort he did not allow any band to do the"heavy lifting"for him but instead opted to put himself out front throughout...too bad...maybe if there was less Smokey and more band his complete lack of respect for these songs might not be so obvious..As for why moderns might disagree with me on this review,all that I can say is if hambones such as Rod Stewart can get away with butchering the great songs and have hit albums while doing so,why not allow Robinson the same opportunity...Neither Robinson nor Stewart have any right to be singing this type of music as,so obviously,they can't understand that it has a dignity they cannot lend to it in thier interpretations...Carly Simon,Linda Ronstadt,Aaron Neville,even Barry Manilow have all done much better jobs re-interpreting the old songs.. Hey,Smokey,go back to writing more stuff like your old Motown hits,and leave the adult stuff alone!Accept your limitations,and do what you do best....Singing this sort of song is NOT what you do best  
 I was very disappointed with this dvd. The last reviewer was spot on in their review. If you just want to see and hear some of these celebs talking, then get this dvd, but if you want more insight as to the photos, how they're taken, etc. then don't waste your money on this 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 Interview is definitely a different type of magazine for me- someone who usually reads business and travel mags- and it's not quite what I expected. With a title like "Interview" I read my first copy of this magazine anticipating pages and pages of nothing but interviews. It turns out that interviewing is the main focus of the magazine, but it's not the only one. There is substantial space given to fashion, movies, and other areas, too. Some of these columns are worth an occasional look, but they failed to grab my attention. The writers seem to play it safe, and that includes the interview section. They don't ask many daring or controversial questions. They keep it simple, asking questions about an entertainer's latest album or movie, without delving much into their personal lives.   Interview has many general annoyances. My greatest complaint is the advertising and the arrangement of the contents. About half of the pages in each issue are covered with ads, with fashion, liquor, beer, and hair care items providing the bulk of the advertising revenue. The ads are everywhere, with the majority in the front pages of each issue. The table of contents is buried, and I find this very frustrating. The contents starts with the interviews for that specific issue on one page, then a few pages later, proceeds to the remainder of the contents, which is the regular monthly features. What's annoying is that you have to search for the table of contents. It varies from one issue to the next, falling somewhere in the first half.   Interview also varies greatly in length. Some issues are as short as 80 pages while others are more than 200 pages long. The shorter issues use staples for binding while the longer issues are bound in a more professional way, minus any metal.   This magazine centers on entertainers, fashion, music, and the like. You won't find any interviews with politicians, businessmen, etc. Interview sticks strictly to entertainers, and that includes the regular monthly columns. You won't find a column about the business side of the music industry or film industry. You will find only articles about the stars themselves.   Interview's only saving grace is the photography. It would make a nice gift for those who enjoy fashion and who like looking at pages and pages of men and women modeling fancy clothing. But in many ways, the photos are overemphasized and there isn't enough substance to the magazine. The articles are very shallow with more eye candy than reading material.   Overall, Interview is sloppy and cluttered with too many ads to make it worthwhile reading material. My subscription was free, and I'm thankful that it was. Besides a few nice photos for clothing, there isn't much to make this magazine worth the cost.  
 I am honestly shocked that not one of the reviews so far written on this page offers any true insight into what a poor offering this album is.  I love Dar and tried over and over to give this album a chance to grow on me but it just does not.  Its only few strongpoints are "Hudson" and "Blue light of the Flame".  Altough "Everyone knows this is Knowhere" is a neat and fun song it fails to do what a truly great cover song sometimes can (provide a brand new look at the original) Cheack out Jonatha Brooke's version of Alan Parson's  "Eye in the sky".   Dar Williams is a great artist.  No artist ( in fact I would venture far enough to say no human being aside from one of the living members of Pink floyd) should EVER cover Comfortably Numb.     Her attempt at doing so is not just a poor choice but a pathetic use of studio time.  Listen to Mortal City and tell me whether this is a good album at all.  Great artists make poor albums that is what this is no matter what she names it.  
 I had high hopes for this book that were quickly dashed by a number of glaring problems.  Nick Eberstadt is a demographer/economist and he analyzes North Korea solely in these terms.  If he were to write a book about North Korean economics, he would probably be capable of writing a masterpiece.  As it is, he steps out of his well-troden field and attempts to predict the future of an entire country from a demographic/economic perspective.  The hubris of Eberstadt's work is that he ventures to write about things he knows little to nothing about. ...In this book, Eberstadt simplifies North Korea into a one-sided demon bristing with weaponry and a declared enemy of the free world.  While this may be true, it is difficult to take him seriously since he analyzes North Korea wholly from the outside.  Curiously missing from his book is a history of the internal developments that allowed North Korea to survive even when the Communist Bloc states fell like dominoes in the 1980s 
 This puzzle was a disappointment.  The pieces are poorly made and don't stay connected.  I thought the picture would be the same on the tin and have the circus animals.  On the upside, the tin is very nice and my son loves to use it to carry his trains around.  The Giant Thomas floor puzzle (24 pieces) was much better 
 When is everyone going to learn - there is no such thing as a how-to-get-rich book.  The title for the book is a joke itself.  Trump and his editors were probably laughing all the way to the bank when they thought of the title.  Seriously, if anybody knows the secret on how to get rich, why would he tell you?  This book is nothing more than a ploy to get some extra dough by capitalizing on the success of The Apprentice.  There is so much white space in the book because there is not much writing in terms of quantity or quality!  The advice is so mundane.  Half of the book is memoirs of a week as Trump - boooring.  And I don't want to read about the show in the last chapter.  I cannot believe this book was published.  The writing stinks and there is even some typos.  Trump may produce quality buildings, but that cannot be said of his books 
 Edward Wilson's works unravel of their own accord.  He tells us that human beings do not have free will.  Ergo, Edward Wilson did not choose to write this book, or any book.  He did not choose what to believe, nor has anyone, and therefore he can make no objective claim to correct knowledge.  If what he says is true then nothing he says can be trusted since it is merely the product of an infinite myriad of uncontrollable externalities working in concert to produce whatever it is that happens to come out of his physical manifestation.  It is even debatable whether or not evolution had true belief or correct knowledge as one of its requirements for survival.  Indeed it can be shown that false belief as much as true belief (and in fact no belief at all) can infer an increased level of fitness on the host organism.   If evolutionary psychology has any truth at all its truth is that we cannot trust our mental faculties to obtain the truth at all.  Nihilism in the truest sense 
 Be sure to measure your arm before purchasing... it's annoying to receive the unit with the Standard Adult Arm Cuff (fits arms 9 to 13 inches around) and find out I have to order a larger arm cuff! Don't bother calling Omron "Customer Service" at 1-800-634-4350... just a typical big company voice mail hell! It even tells you to call another number to order the piece... My 1 Star rating is only for the ordering information not provided and Omrons "customer service 
 I was looking for a good treatment of not just what decisions need to be made (I knew those already) but realworld examples I could build on.  Pages and pages of command line switches and API does NOT get OpenLDAP deployed 
 This is the kind of translation exercise you get in this book. Other reviewers have commented on the stilted language and subject matter, both in English and Arabic. How about, "I have seen many spiders. The beys' and pashas' rooms must be swept afresh," or "Follow the well-known plan and put the olives in the barrels."  These are not sentences from 1965, the date of the first edition, but from the British mandate.    If you want to learn Arabic, you need to use a text book, not a grammar book. There are lots of good ones available, and there are lots of grammar books available with more authentic examples 
 Much too stereotypical for my tastes and the storyline is not only unbelievable- it drags on and on. Sadly, from reading some of the reviews on Amazon, Mr. Hiassen's stereotypical, over the top books on the people of Florida are read by many as real and some reviewers state that they want to visit Florida after reading Mr. Hiaasen's books. This is sad- that  people actually believe that the state is chock full of characters like Twilly Spree, Clinton Skink Tyree and Palmer Stoat. Where does he get these names? During my 25 years in Florida, the people I met  had names like Robert, Jim, Mary, Chris, Michael, etc. By the way, for those of you who think I am just a Floridian with sour grapes- I have been a proud resident of the Northeast for over 20 years. I just dislike stereotyping of groups of people. It causes prejeudice, misunderstanding and in extreme cases- hatred. Read some Christopher Moore for your humor fix. He doesn't stereotype and although his stories are over the top in his own way, he makes them believable and fun 
 Mr. Dennett's book demonstrates the ignorance, irrationality, and dishonesty  of humanists. Discussing the meaning of word materialsim, Professor Dennett says:  "In its scientific or philosophical sense, it refers to a theory that aspires to explain all the phenomena without recourse to anything immaterial--like a Cartesian soul, or "ectoplasm"--or God. The standard negation of materialistic in the scientific sense is dualistic, which maintains that there are two entirely different kinds of substance, matter and ...whatever minds are supposedly made of." (p. 302)  Philosophers stopped believing in dualism a thousand years ago with the development of metaphysics. A modern view is that man is an indefinability that becomes conscious of its own existence.   The philosophy that God does not exist is not materialism, it is naturalism. Materialism is the view that all that exists is matter. Materialists frequently say that free will is an illusion and that the experience of the existence of oneself is some kind of epiphenomena. (In a quote below, you will see that Dennett puts free will in a list of things people belief in.)  It is not clear from the book whether Dennett is a materialist, but he is certainly a naturalist. Concerning the proof of God's existence, he trots out David Hume's "Who made God?" which is based on a misunderstanding of the principle of causality. I refer the reader to my personal website for my version of the proof.  Let's look at two quotes, the first is at the end of the chapter "Belief in Belief" and the other at the beginning of the chapter "Morality and Religion":   "That is, isn't it true that, whether or not God exists, religious belief is at least as important as the belief in democracy, in the rule of law, in free will? The very widespread (but far from universal) opinion is that religion is the bulwark of morality and meaning." (p. 245)  " Without the divine carrot and stick, goes this reasoning, people would loll about aimlessly or indulge their basest desires, beak their promises, cheat on their spouses, neglect their duties, and so on.  There are two well-known problems with this reasoning: (1) it doesn't seem to be true, which is good news, since (2) is is such a demeaning view of human nature." (p. 279)  In the first chapter, he mentions "bulwark of morality" and "meaning." But in the second chapter, he leaves out "meaning."  If our purpose in life is not to get to heaven, what is our purpose is life?   Whether religion supports morality can be determined by observing whether there is a correlation of moral conduct with religious belief. Mr. Dennett makes such a correlation to the detriment of religion by citing the high divorce rate of fundamentalist Christians.  There are worse things than divorcing your spouse. Disingenuousness can be worse and can take the form of leaving unsaid what should have been said. Mr. Dennett should have explained why he did not discuss the idea that religion gives meaning to life.  The only miracle mentioned in Mr. Dennett's book is the Shroud of Turin, which has on it a mysterious image of a crucified man.  Since no one claims to know how the image got there, it can be called a miracle. However, Mr. Dennett does not tell us anything about it. The reader is left to find out about the famous relic by looking it up on the internet. 
 I was disappointed as to how little information was in this book.  Additionally, several pages of the were printed out of sequence.  I had the feeling this thing was thrown together. Some 64 of the book's 280 pages is a glossary.  Don't waste your money. Shame on you Nellie and Peter 
 Warning: contains some spoilers, mostly regarding Red Mars.  Other reviewers have beaten me to some of the better criticisms of Green Mars: the endless dialogues that merely rehash themes from Red, the irritating pseudo-socialism, the ludicrous indefatigability and resourcefulness of the characters, etc.    I'd like to add two points.  First, I swear to Almighty God that if I ever meet KSR--be it in a social setting or just at the supermarket--I will punch him square in the face and say "That's for you and your @#$%ing eco-economics!"  My second point is somewhat more serious: unlike Red Mars, the novel has no central human story.  In Red, Robinson rather excellently used John, Frank, and Maya's love triangle both to hold the novel together and add some character-based tension: did Frank intend for John to die in the Nicacea riot?  if so, was it motivated by jealousy or politics, or both?  will Maya find out?  if so, will she be able to forgive Frank?    All of this was, however, completely lacking in the sequel.  The only relationship with any successful tension is between Sax and Phyllis, and it hardly frames the novel.  In Red Mars Robinson pulled-off a rather staggering feat: however imperfectly, he wrote a HS Fiction novel about the colonization of Mars while creating a competent host of characters and even a couple of interesting relationships.  He just didn't have it in him to do it twice 
 Prey is to a novel what the "wild swarm" Ricky was to the real Ricky: It presents a suggestion of a real book, but lacks the features, the characteristics of the real thing ... and it disperses on the ground at the slightest breeze.   Like the worst of the bodice-ripper genre, Prey's hero, Jack, makes the stupidest decisions - or makes no decision at all - when presented with behaviors that would alarm anyone else ... all to make the plot move forward where Crichton wants it to go.   And when the communication lines were ripped out by the nano-Ricky and nano-Julia, I kept wondering whatever happened to Jack's cell phone? You know, the one he'd just used the day before to talk to his kids, and that worked just fine out in the desert?   Nevertheless, I kept reading to the end because Crichton's discussion about programming based on the natural world was fascinating. For that it gets a 2 rather than a 1.     
 This book was assigned as a college reading assignment for an American Literature course, so I knew right off that I wasn't in for a real literary treat.  The criteria for a reading assignment are: a main character must suffer and then die, and language and plot must work to confuse the reader.  If you're looking for an entertaining read, do not choose this novel.  If, however, you are looking to read something for the sole purpose of telling others that you have read it, and wish to brag at dinner parties and other things of that nature, this is probably the book for you.  Personally, I like to believe that I have better things to do than read something that is depressing, boring, and poorly written 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 A good friend of mine insisted I'd read this book, because she knows I love exploring the spiritual aspects of life.   In the end I was very disappointed.  Not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book, but Michael Crichton's whole attitude.  He would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences, only to revert back to his arrogant, narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter.  How can anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in?  Sadly, this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.  I have no desire to read any more of his books 
 As much as I loved the movie, I was very disappointed in the CD. I thought this was suppose to be a soundtrack. It is not! The French songs in the movie were lovely, this version is not what I expected 
 This was an alarming book promoting some strange doctrines. Mr. Noe believes the earth will last forever and that Jesus returned invisibly in his Second Advent in A.D. 70.  He also believes that this complex of new doctrines is helping to establish a "New Reformation." He believes that Christianity has been mistaken about the basic doctrines of the Bible for 2000 years.   And he sets himself before as one who can straighten things out. If this is what Christian doctrine is all about, I don't want any part of it.   We have too many "prophecy experts" among us. Away with this man. We will not have him to reign over us! After reading Noe, Tim LaHaye seems to make sense (but only by comparison).  I would pass on this volume. 
 What a waste of money!  After sending about 160 letters to the various recruiters listed in this book, about 90 were returned as undeliverable due to firms out of business and people moving to different firms.  The headhunter business is extremely fluid and recruiters apparently do not remain with a firm for any length of time.  The book also advises people not to call a recruiter on the telephone.  This must be an attempt to alleviate the recruiters from having to actually speak to a person without having a sure shot position open for them.  The authors must be former recruiters because they seem to write from a recruiter's point of view and not a job seeker's.  The book's advice and how-to sections are common sense; anyone with half a brain uses the steps outlined in the book already without having to be told to do so.  All that this book accomplishes is to line the pockets of the authors at the expense of people who are looking for valid resources that can assist them in a job search.  Ask your Uncle Ralph if he knows of anyone who is hiring and don't give these two useless people,(Christopher Hunt and Scott Scanlon) any of your hard earned money, especially if you're currently unemployed.  P.S.  the only reason my review has one star is because I wasn't offered the option of no stars 
 Ok, first of all, read that ttle again. Don't you love how idiotic grown ups sounds when they try to, like, borrow the vernacular twists of their offspring for ironic employment in a, like, polemical setting? Reminds me of Cusack's dad in 'Better off Dead,' the way he keeps trying to talk to his son on his son's level. There's so much bad faith and pretension permeating this book- it's all there in the title...  As for the' author's "polemic," it basically consits of numerous, misinformed, tendentious tracts soldered together into a rusty heap. You've heard this spiel before, most likely from your grandparents or parents who just don't get it- that they had their time. This is our era. Our use of language reflects and underlines our differences from those who came before.   I particularly didn't like his seeming dismissal/blanket statement on hip hop. He really ain't down with the brothas, which is not surprising, given that he's a black intellectual, and there's nothing established black academics like more than a long-winded, whingeing harangue about the endemic evils of hip hop Kulture. Ugh. He doesn't even seem to possess much of a knowledge of hip hop artists or their work... Nada... There is much that I find execrable in said culture and in it's major 'artists' but still how can one overlook its myriad unifying and artistic elements... Even I manage not to fall prey to an all-too-easy reductionist formula, which seems to be the The main point here- the author views the degredation of the english Language through the lens of pop culture at large (as a bad thing, mind you), it begins in the evil counterculture 60's and... you know...   Digressive, ranting out-of-context mixed with counter-intuitive psuedo-linguistic gibberish. For example, the author holds up both Dylan and Tom waits as examples of artists who are reverred not for their songwriting abilities, but more for their authenticity, thir 'genuineness'. This is plain false. Laughably false. I've never met a fan of either artist who wasn't struck by their strange and completely idiosyncratic use of language. Moreover, the author seems to feel that pop culture music is driven by whites emulating blacks. True, up to a point. I love this stance, and from Chuck Berry to James Brown to Miles Davis to Funkadelic to Fishbone to Bad Brains, to the innumerable black influences on The Clash, I will never tire of pointing out that, basically, it's all black music. One would think that, at least on some level, this is a good thing... But no, it leads back to the counter-kulture (with a k) ideals that have subverted language...????   HUH?  The saddest thing is that, as a reactionary elitist, I'm inclined to agree with many of the author's basic points. But both his presentation and his defense of his points were so hare-brained and wrong, I just felt sullied. With friends like these...  
 After a week of using this I find the motor noise that others talk about is nothing.  Mine is a refurbished model from tigerdirect, so maybe the motor was already fixed :-)  My mother in law has a camcorder that sounds like a blender.  The ZR 500 is OK in low light, but you CAN adjust the exposure manually to correct if it isn't to your liking. You can also adjust the focus too!  My friend who is a mini DV guru said that in this end of the consumer spectrum this camera is on par.    I've made two practice DVD's (with firewire, no problem at all) with this camera and like what I see.    For those of you that have bad motornoise: try your video software to edit the noise out.  Power Director has that feature.  I am happy with this product, but I would rather have a higher end model now that I have a bit more in my budget for a camcorder. A great camcorder for beginners!  
 It's really not the authors' fault, but there are so many people that worked on this case, it is confusing trying to keep everyone straight.  Same with the victims.  To me, this book never fully developed the characters.  It's more like a rundown of what happened, but nothing of substance.  This book is mainly about Malvo and Muhammed, but who are they really?  At the end there is a brief conversation from Malvo that was very interesting because it gave some feedback on what he'd done, but that's it.  I just felt a void, like what was really the point?  By the end I was ready to be done with the book and move onto something better.  I bought this from a book club and wish I hadn't 
 I really enjoyed Jean-Claude's earlier films.  But, they keep seeming to get worse and worse.  The dude kicked like 3 times in the film.  The best part of Jean-Claude's films are the fight scenes and these sucked.  You know you are getting cheese whenever you watch any of his movies but instead of cheedar this was some moldy government crap!  I'm really hoping he'll get with Steven Segal talk about how much they both suck, watch their old movies and then go back to thier roots 
 I was prepared to warm to this book because of its promised inclusion of other amateur endeavors besides the cello.  But to these he gives barely a nod.  The writing blends self-centered prattle with compulsive journal entries.  Another disappointment--rather, jolt--was his two brief paragraphs about painting on pages 184-185.  Given his sympathy and respect for amateur musicians, I anticipated a reflection on painters who, like myself, struggle to express in our work a hard-won understanding of color, two-dimensional space, depth and authenticity.  Instead, he writes, "Well, there are so many amateur painters around, and their stuff is generally so awful, that they almost tempt me to cancel this book..."  Thus, I could not recommend this book to amateur cooks, painters, photographers, writers, tennis players, gardeners--or anyone other than amateur string players who don't know how they feel and need someone to tell them.  For the rest of us, our time is better spent doing what we love rather than reading about it 
 Indeed,this book is about the best I've read on the subject thus far and is well balanced. I would have given FIVE stars however one thing perturbed me no end! This book contains the SAME information as THE ESSENTIAL AUSTRALIAN SHEPHERD and is mostly verbatim!  The two books have entirely different titles,the author of one is not listed on the cover of the other,the publishers seem to be different and the dates of publication are different. Any reasonably intelligent ,trusting person would assume they were different books! Caveat emptor. I purchased both books,paid twice and about the only difference between them was one was hardcover and one was paperback...oh,and though the content inside was almost exactly the same,the covers were very different for some odd reason. I would search the library next time 
 Ok what was the point of this book? It was nothing more than a study of oversexed, kinky, S&M-obsessed perverts throughout the course of a windy day in Los Angeles. Rechy's overused symbol of the "Sant'Anas" was eventually annoying and his pervasive sexual language and scenarios had no artistic merit whatsoever and no purpose other than thoroughly grossing out this (gay) reader. Save your time and read a true gay masterpiece- "Dancer From the Dance"- instead. I regret picking this one up 
 The cover blurb made this book sound amazing; if only it were as complex and fulfilling as it sounded.  The book is very dependent upon Katherine's character, yet she simply didn't mesh for me.  She didn't come off as dangerous or interesting; she sounded more like any immature, impulsive, hard-drinking twenty-two-year-old. And the plot seemed bogged down in a "Groundhog Day" scenario, the same scene happening over and over.  There were snippets here and there that showcased talented writing; I agree w/ the other reviewer that Sabina Murray seems more suited to short stories. Over all, the book seemed poorly edited, with no real cohesion or feeling that the plot was moving forward 
 YES, I GAVE IT ONLY 2 STARS! I have read alot of motivational books in my life time but this one leaves you empty. Patt Summitt does not give a "one-size fits all" approach to obtaining Life's goals as she suggest.  Pat Summitt gives these long drawn out stories of her coaching experience and players experience then, at the very end, ties it to a generic principle of leadership that has been rehash by hundred of other motivational book writers.  I'm not hating on her leadership or abilities. She has proven herself a dynamic coach.  If you're a HS/college couch of any sport then this is the book for you! but for the rest of us her approaches to leadership do not necessarily translates to pearls of wisdom 
 "This is one of the FEEL-GOOD British books. The history of the Western World begins with the British defeating the Spanish armada, and ending on Waterloo . "British" victory 
 Don't waste your time or money with this DVD.  The best part of the DVD is probably the Trailers and most of those are Garbage also.  My DVD came loose in the package and scratched, too bad it didn't do any damage to ruin the Movie.  I couldn't wait until the Movie was over, I would have stopped it earlier, but wanted to see if any damage was done.  You'll be counting the minutes and seconds after watching the first half or even earlier.  The last story was stupid and horrible and should have been left off.  Don't waste your money, spend it on the cheap $5-6 horror DVD's, because at least those can be somewhat entertaining 
 I was very disappointed by the book.I wanted an explanation for Israels continuing occupation of Palestinian lands but got only apologistic rhetoric from this obvious pro zionist.Much of his writing I thought quite racist and certainly biased 
 When purchasing audiobooks, I normally follow a simple but very effective rule: never, never, never buy an audiobook read by the author. Even if the author is a talented writer, he/she is invariably a terrible narrator. Always look for audiobooks performed by experienced readers, as in Bryson's own "Notes From a Small Island" and "A Walk in the Woods", read by Ron Mclarty.  In Bryson's case I made a rare exception when I listened to "In a Sunburned Country" - the audio version had received reasonable reviews and his performance was indeed adequately entertaining. For this reason I assumed that "Neither Here Nor There" would be equally enjoyable. I was wrong. Bryson's deadpan monologue makes it sound as though he was bored out of his mind while reading this book. Passages that may have seemed amusing in the written version are herein delivered in a sleep-inducing monotone. The sardonically comedic talent he displayed in his reading of "In a Sunburned Country" is totally lacking. I would recommend this audiobook only as a cure for insomnia 
 Disappointing.  I was expecting an Audubon-style reference book, but got a simpler, very brief, nothing new, thin, magazine-sized tickler.  I've heard good things about Stokes, but this book wasn't a winner.  Was looking for more details about plantlife, positioning of shrubs, feeders, bird baths, landscaping etc, but book consisted more of bios on birds with a little bird-feeding info. at the beginning of the book.  Save your money and go elsewhere. :- 
 Sequels to films based upon Stephen King stories are usually rather awful.  The "Children of the Corn" formula was beaten into the ground fairly early, and the sequel to "Carrie" was an absolute dog.  This one, although it is a clunky, poorly-written hack job, is nonetheless entertaining in places.  It it worth viewing just for Clancy Brown's outrageously funny portrayal of Gus.  Other than that, it's nothing special.  Edward Furlong somehow manages to look and act creepier than the villains, but watch it anyway.  Gus is a gas 
 Jon Katz does have a problem but it isn't a midlife crisis.  This is a book about an unemployed New Jersey writer who deserts his family for a couple of months to "find himself" by embarking on an odyssey to a local Vermont vacation home only to find that he's bored and runs back to his family for entertainment and a cure for his own shallowness.  The "mountain" is a hill off a local Vermont highway.  The "spiritual transformation" is analogous to that of a couch potato who feels hungry during Monday night football and heads back to the fridge to discover  replenishment.  The man has no insight.  His thoughts and observations are as shallow as Howard Stern.  He attempts to lend some credibility and substance to his ramblings by comparing himself with Thomas Merton and dragging Merton anecdotes in to pad the book where Katz clearly has nothing substantive to offer.  Save a tree and avoid this book at all costs.  Better yet, write your own and offer the rest of us something worthwhile to ponder rather than this drivel.  If you read this book you will understand why Katz was unemployed when he wrote it 
 I purchased this book and I want my money back. The book is clearly written, yet it repeats and repeats things which we all know and things the author keeps repeating in all his well-worn works.  Instead of 200-plus  pages, it could have been done in 20 
 I'm an "old movie buff" and I find this to be a pretty awful movie.  It's really full of the most simple-minded dialogue.  See these great actors in something that's a little less polemical.  The writers' social conservatism just jumps off the screen.  You could use this for a Media Studies film to contrast with an "old film" from the same time that shows people living with much more self-awareness.  Two stars only for the bright young daughters - great actresses 
 The nineties were a pivotal era for the software industry. The masses began to embrace computers while the industry responded by making personal computers more and more useful and affordable to the average person. The proliferation of access to more powerful computers spurred the growth of the Internet toward a critical mass. These mutually supporting trends snowballed into a genuine cultural transformation.  In the marketplace, the demands for PC hardware and software were growing at astonishing rates. Thousands of software startups were vying to stake out the largest territories on the new frontier. Powerful multinational corporations were competing ruthlessly to dominate enormous mass markets.  The general character of all this competition was that of a race. Competitors raced to create the most significant technological advantages for customers, particularly those features most complicated and difficult to mimic. By consistently outpacing the competition, one could secure a privileged position as front runner. One could retain this privilege only by continuing to improve products at least as quickly as any challenger. Enormous fortunes were won and lost in this race, and it affected virtually everyone involved in the creation of software.   During this era, most software managers were under tremendous pressure to optimize immediate construction speed. Teams heroically sprinted to the finish line, the next product delivery date, only to be told that the race was not really over, that they must immediately start sprinting again. Only a few mature organizations realized that they were actually running a marathon.  Before the dust settled, the average complexity of a marketable software application was to increase a hundredfold. Unfortunately, a majority of software professionals were not equipped to deal with such complex systems. They failed to realize that beyond a certain degree of complexity formal architecture and design methods become indispensible. They naïvely elevated construction speed above all other considerations. Crippled by this self-defeating objective, many teams were driven to the breaking point. The rate of project failure grew rapidly. Poor working conditions were widespread. Engineers were disillusioned and discouraged. The most capable managers resigned themselves to dutifully wasting resources in order to give the outward appearance of construction progress while design work went on behind the scenes, almost secretly.  Enter Steve McConnell's "Rapid Development." It set out to address what many thought to be the most pressing software development problem of its day, speed. There were already dozens of tools and methods on the market that promised to increase development speed. These were deemed "rapid application development (RAD)" tools and methods. But they had all failed to deliver. The software industry was still desperately searching for a silver bullet. It was the perfect time for a new book on the subject, especially one granted legitimacy by Microsoft Press. (Because of Microsoft's superlative success during those difficult times, popular opinion held that they were the ultimate authority on how to develop software. Despite a cynical attitude that prevailed among many engineers, books backed by Microsoft were generally taken seriously.)  This book accomplished a lot of good in its day. It stimulated the reader's thinking along the right lines. It said, in effect, "If you want to work faster, you will need more than motivational speeches, `performance' awards, gadgets, and quick-fix schemes. You will need to devote real mental energy to the problem." That was a message that most managers desperately needed to hear, and most developers applauded. If you were a typical developer, this was a great book to recommend to your manager.   But now it is the year 2007. In the full light of day, this book's charlatanism seems obvious. It is gushing with camaraderie with the poor, overworked developer. While denouncing the silver bullet syndrome prevalent at that time, it proffers its own magic pill. It says, in effect, "My friends, this book contains the secret elixir of speed."   In essence, "Rapid Development" asserts that, although RAD tools and quick-fix techniques alone do not work, simply choosing the appropriate "best practices" for your project will solve all your problems. Everything comes down to avoiding a few simple mistakes. Like the silver bullets it purports to replace, it neglects to mention the intricacies of architecture and design to be mastered and the creative talent to be developed. Instead of endeavoring to teach the abstract principles relevant to software development efficiency, it bombards the reader with inane diagrams and fictitious scenarios involving companies with cute names.  Not surprisingly, from the outset, McConnell tags development speed as the essential problem of the software industry. But, even by his own definition, so-called rapid development is a chimera. In reality, the software market creates specific windows of opportunity with particular success requirements. There can be no absolute standard against which to quantify raw speed independent of other factors. The proper goal is not simply developing software quickly, it is outpacing competitors in terms of customer satisfaction gained versus time, and doing so consistently over the course of many releases. Time to market is only relevant to planning in specific cases. It cannot be abstracted and considered in a vacuum. What software teams need is not speed but long-term efficiency, and control leading to consistent predictability. The scourge of the industry in the mid nineties was the naïve belief that the race is won or lost by lines of code per day. By framing the problem in terms of construction speed, this book only helped to perpetuate that error.  We cannot avoid the fact that software engineering is a highly complex and creative endeavor. It requires significant knowledge, skill, and talent. In the immature industry of the nineties, many professionals were not properly equipped for their jobs. In particular, a much deeper theoretical foundation for architecture and design was needed. To some extent this is still true today. Such knowledge and the skill of applying it must be painstakingly gained through in-depth study or formal training. It cannot be acquired as McConnell suggests, by casually reading fictitious scenarios and contemplating "best practices" while waiting in airports.  On the whole, "Rapid Development" comes across as a high-pressure sales pitch for the concept of "best practices." The fundamental premise behind this concept is that software is like fast food. If we create a streamlined process and train our teams to observe certain rules, we can churn out software products like hamburgers off an assembly line. This is the antithesis of a proper conceptual approach. The common idea that unites "best practices" and fast food is that of economizing by employing uncreative and under-educated labor. Perhaps, in a labor market with a dearth of qualified engineers, such drastic measures are required. But we must not forget that they are interim measures. As long as the public wants great software, we cannot really reduce the demand for good engineers by employing "best practices." Everyone will simply have to wait until the supply catches up with the demand. In the mean time, perhaps we ought to avoid chasing away the best engineers we already have and discouraging newcomers.  Even today this book is not completely worthless. There are a few useful pieces of hard data, though they merely support what seasoned software professionals already know by experience. And a talented young engineer with good analytical skills may be able to abstract some of the important principles of software engineering success from the "case histories" and their discussions. 
 I bought this hoping it would cure my busted Superdrive on my G4 iMac but when connected via the Firewire it would freeze any program I was using to burn cd's or dvd's.  I thought it might have been a messed up product so I returned it to Lacie and got another one but the problem still persisted.    I then thought it was my computer, but the firewire ports worked when connected to my old iPod and even worked when connected to my Lacie external HDD.  Finally figured that the product was defective after I purchased the Sony DRX-830 dvd burner and that burner worked perfectly when connected via firewire.    This product however worked when connected on the USB port but the burning speeds were so slow that it was just about useless 
 Bash has very many operators/symbols, e.g. [[ ]]  Finding discussions of the symbols is impossible, as the reference doesn't have many of them.  As a direct result, it is a miserable experience using this book to try to learn BASH or to try to interpret existing scripts 
 Most of the reviews near mine appear to be from people who have not used this book in several sessions or read it thoroughly. I want to give the book 1 star simply to cancel out the 5 stars given blindly by the WotC fanboys (of which I would be one if they weren't so lazy) but 2 is more accurate.   Yes, the Spell Compendium has lots of material. Lots of unedited material. There are numerous mistakes throughout the book. I do not mean spelling and grammar (although there is a lack of that at times) -- I am referring to using proper game terminology, references, matching description/header, and so forth. Some spells do not match up with their core counterparts--some underpowered, some overpowered.  There is a two-spell combination that grants True Resurrection on a party member at 9th level Cleric, (IIRC but it might be 7th). At no XP or gold cost. That is Character Level 9, not spell level 9. I won't list it here because it's ridiculous and bad enough already, but it's not hard to figure out if you read the cleric lists. Try to find "Draconic Polymorph"...you won't.  At least one of the spells (Graymantle) makes reference to an inapplicable 3.0 mechanic (Regeneration).  A lot of spells give different schools in the lists and in the description. The teleport spells are listed as Transmutation spells, which was changed to Conjuration in 3.5.  Some of the spells listed do not have any data for duration, range, etc.  Yes, this could be erratad, but A) There is just _so much_ to errata. I don't want to carry around a handbook to go with my manual. B) What exactly are the editors getting paid for? To make a physically attractive and appealing book, I guess. C) WotC needs to PLAYTEST their material. Externally. They are the richest game company in the world, but apparently also the laziest (essentially TSR except with marketing execs and MBA's). It costs nothing to test externally except some very fine print credits on half of one page, or in the absolute worst case scenario, some free product.  In my opinion, it was lazy of WotC to create so many classes and not provide updated spell lists for any of them (especially base classes--PRC's I can understand). Instead it gives "suggestions" which is of no help to a player who bought this book but whose DM won't let him use anything out of it due to the spell not being on the player's spell list. Any good DM could write up hundreds of spells on a dozen spell lists over the course of several weeks of careful research...or he could be writing and running adventures. Why pay $40 for a book that expects you to do that work? Their supposed excuse is that they would have had to drop some spells to include new lists. What is the difference if you can't use any of the spells in your game, anyway...BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PROVE THE SPELL IS ON YOUR LIST? I also say that if you are going to ask the DM to do that much work, why not just ask him to write 1,000 new spells? They would be at least as balanced and thorough as the book we are paying for.  I am not saying all of this in a pout because my DM won't let me use the book. All of my DM's will, but **I wish they wouldn't** because there needs to be an explicit spell list for each class, not just ad hoc spell casting out of a book no one else at the table is familiar with. I also DM and use the book only with much scrutiny.  There was a small but good thread on this at the publisher's (WotC) site, called "Spell Compendium Errors/Querries." Others may be found with a minimum of searching.  CONCLUSION: Only buy the book if, like me, you are a sucker for having every POS book put out by WotC on your mantle to impress your friends when they visit. Or if you make way more money than you need and have nothing else to spend it on; personally, I would rather have more minis. If you do buy the book, expect to use it to pick up a couple of spells per caster PC to fill a gap in your (previously balanced) spell list or because you can't pass up an overpowered spell.  For the most part, expect it to collect dust (outside of those 2 uses per PC) and be a source of regret, unless you fall into one of the above 2 categories (rich or stupid) 
 While the information contained in this book is important, I found the poor English and grammatical errors to be unacceptable.  Also, the accompanying maps are exceedingly poor in quality (very difficult to read).  I had hoped for so much more.  I'll think twice before purchasing another book from Mr. Skousen.  I certainly won't pay full price 
 This film is one of the worst I have seen.  I really don't know what other films Sean Reid has produced but this one was kind of bad. The film opens up by saying it's based on true events, so you wonder is it based on Sean Reid's young life trying to pursue acting.  To me this film was pointless.  It's named Redemption, redemption from what?  It shows Christian, played by Brian White,  going through depressive pshycotic episodes trying to find his way in life. The only scenes I liked were between him and his father.  The conversations between them were very meaningful with Christian trying to get through to his father, which lets you in on his family history, and his father trying to help his son cope with life.  Christian is battling many demons; his father not being a good example in his life, his mother not being there, his struggle to pursue acting, and trying to find love.  This all leads to Christian making poor decisions.  He starts partying and getting in stupid fights.  He starts to take a turn for the worse when he meets this actor who can get him a gig and starts using marijuana.  One of his friends, the guy who plays Marlon, acts like a total jerk and disrepects women and his girlfriend puts up with it.  It was ridiculous.  Melique, another one of Christian's friends stops hanging with them when he sees that they are starting to make wrong decisions.  Realizing this, Christian finds Melique.  Melique tries to redeem Christian from himself by having a serious heart to heart talk with him.  You would think that since the movie is named "Redemption" that Christian at this point would turn his life around.  He does find hope again and wants to start a new life with his girlfriend (Claire).  It doesn't last long when Trent (a foe of his) spots him and beats him up.  Then the downward spiral begins again.  Christian starts getting high and starts having hallucinations.  He has a mental breakdown and starts doing strange things.  He think he sees Trent and goes out in a rage with a knife in his hand running around town half naked.  When the police officers can't get through to him he gets shot.    Overall this movie was bizarre and kind of a waste of time.  Some scenes didn't make sense and it was very overdramatic 
 Ritter flip-flopped his WMD position after finding a place on Al Jazeera's payroll.  Al Jazeera is openly sympathetic to Islamofascists, who aim to kill us.  Ritter's arrest was not his first pedophilia-related entanglement, and it's a bit too "black helicopter" to think that local law enforcement sleazebag round-ups are really plots to silence political enemies 
 I bought this book for a readings class this semester.  I don't have a suitable vocabulary to describe how poor it is.  The text is inconsistent and full of errors.  The author blathers on without concluding much.  He references his previous work and that of PhD theses (which I can only assume are his own students).  I question the underlying assumptions of his theory but it is never fleshed out in sufficient detail to be understood and examined.  Some examples:  Page 8, the author discusses history, "there were no exceptions or counterexamples (to Newton's laws) until Einstein advanced the theory of relativity".  Really?  How about Maxwell's equations, the Michelson-Morley experiments, the theory of the ether, Mercury's orbit around the Sun?  Page 18, The author uses matrix algebra notation and operations on nonlinear equations. Superposition does not apply to nonlinear equations.  Example 1-13, consists of a redesign problem where one constraint is "no increase in cost", and the solution to the example problem is to add a component to the existing design.  And that component is free?  Title of one section: "Reduction of uncertainty: Conversion of a design with time-dependent combinatorial complexity to a design with time-dependent periodic complexity".    It goes on.  I made it about 100 pages into it 
 One earring was damaged and instead of replacing it as I requested, they "fixed" it.   I will not be using Amazon to purchase jewelry anytime soon   
 At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a "well isn't that contrite" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight.   Some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti-catholic. I think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book. Althogh, there are some kooks that think this book is about reality, instead of fiction,   A much more interesting book, in a similar venue (modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones), is Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Be forewarned, Eco's novel is a MUCH more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel. It is analogous to comparing cotton candy (Da Vinci Code) to a 12 course gourmet dinner (Foucault's Pendulum). Both will satisfy hunger, both are a type of food, but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling.  
 Unless you are really into modern art, Picasso, and Guernica (the painting) you'll probably find this book a bit boring.  Not that it isn't well written and researched, it is, but for the average reader something more was needed.  I was looking for more insights into Picasso the man and a deeper look into those troubled times. About the only feeling in this book is a kind of leftist-elitist-snobbery. I'm about halfway through the book now and may finish it... 
 I have been doing a lot of reading on Welles for a research project and while it is clear that Welles was no angel, this book seems to go out of its way to put Welles in the worst possible light.  There are too many flights of fancy and liberties taken.  For example, based on no evidence Thomson suggests that not only did Welles have sexual relations with Dorothy Commingore but that he practically raped her.  Perhaps the book reveals more about the author than it does about its subject.  There are some useful takes  on lesser known figures like John Toland but on the whole it is a book to take with several grains of salt 
 I too should have read the description more thoroughly. Some good advice but expensive for 38 pages. I thought I was getting a book, not a bookLET. Definitely don't feel I got a bang for my bucks 
 This book was recommended highly by Ted Gunderson, a former FBI agent who now speaks out agains the Globalists.  Gunderson claimed this book is the best intro in the the plan for a one world government. He must be smoking krills, because this book is terribly dated.  Worst of all, the book really is anti-semitic, and I say that fully knowing how overused that term is by the ADL and their legions.  Carr calls the empire "the Synagogue of Satan" and claims the Jews are "rapacious" evil people sworn to destroy society.  Come on.  This stuff is borderline disinfo and at best outdated, misguided vitriol.  The conspiracy is real, but no one group is behind it.  Avoid this flawed work and get something better 
 The film opens with a Vice President spouting hysterical propaganda about handguns in Detroit. When he leaves, an assassination is attempted by killers dressed as motorcycle policemen! [Can you believe this? No explanation follows.] Sent to a new precinct, Boyd attends an anger management class. Leaving early, he gets a chance to manage his anger when he meets strangers admiring his pickup truck. Next there is the comic relief in buying an expensive import car. Boyd encounters a drug sale, busts it up and arrests a drug dealer. But this is an undercover cop, and Boyd finds himself on traffic duty (more laughs). Boyd gets a chance to meet other officers at an intramural event. Later we see a robbery by masked men who steal 50 Kilos of heroin. [Does anyone keep this amount?]  More action occurs at a nightclub. Seagal shows his fighting skills in a choreographed scene. The film continues to develop the story. This film does not have as good a story as his earlier films. Boyd asks a news reporter to gather information on a person with a clean record. But then he is surprised by villains. There is an exciting car chase and crashes, action to pad out this story. Another shooting and car chase in a parking garage adds more action.  It shows why you should always wear a seat belt. There is a final showdown that reveals the last villain. Friendly forces arrive, like the Cavalry in an Old Western. There is a shootout that puts an end to the conspiracy.   A good movie has a good storyline, its not a sequence of violent actions. "Hard to Kill" and "Out for Justice" were better films. Seagal seems to be older, fatter, and slower than in earlier films. John Wayne's films hid his aging well.  
 "Pity the Nation" is more a diary of Fisk's travels and experiences in Lebanon than a history of the Lebanese Civil War.  Fisk vividly describes events he sees, but what occurs beyond his literal field of vision is undocumented. As an example, Fisk spends four chapters discussing the 1982 Sabra and Chatila massacre, but only two pages on the 1985-1988 War of the Camps (where Amal killed more Palestinians than Elie Hobeika).    Fisk brings to life a few of his reporter friends, but the main political actors of the war are only described from a distance 
 Wow, another book on the TG world (anticipation, anticipation)! Then -- letdown. Just imagine how your maiden aunt, or a conservative suburban club-woman, might see the transgendered world of (mostly) early Baby-Boomers as filtered through the observations of a TG-bashing mentor, i.e. the self-styled Canadian "sex scientist" Ray Blanchard. Sorry, it just doesn't live up to its promise as a fitting explication of the subject, and its WAY too short to do so, even had it gone seriously into understanding TG/TS/CD folk.  A work of clever opinion, but little social merit. My significant other and I had a few good laughs over this one 
 Read the first few chapters and the last few pages.  As usual, the remaining 300 pages were just repetition.  Danielle Steele should come up with a new "formula" (as mentioned in previous reviews) or tuck her pen away once and for all. 
 god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, "then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after."  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.            
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 This book was good but not terrific. after reading best sellers like Why we want you to be rich by Donald TRump and God Doesn't run a $2 Shop by Sage Saint Francis i found that this book just was not in the same leauge.  This book just did not cut it, i mean those two books changed my life, and actually got me the result and financial freedom i was after but they are not for everyone.  I found this information to be very simple and at times misleading...at best!  I do not feel this is the authors best work, however i still believe it is a good investment and a descent place to start. 
 Basic Instinct was a pretty good movie.  Basic Instinct 2, not so good.  But Sharon Stone is still HOT!  It is worth buying the movie just to see her 
 One hell of a waste of money! if you are expecting alot of the same charectors from the first movie like I was, you are in for a hell of a disappointment! the only reason why I think the first one was bad ass is cause Vin Diesel was in it, and yeah it was totally bad ass! I'll tell you one thing that this damn thing has in common with the first movie is that the only real cars were destroyed, in this movie you get two real cars this time, a 1969 Camaro SS, and a 1970 Dodge Challenger r/t and they both get destroyed! who in their right mind would destroy those sexy cars! God all mighty! Don't waste your money on this movie, I wouldn't take this disappointment if it was given to me! if you are wanting to buy a kick ass movie, buy Frost bite! you won't be disappointed 
 I ended up with three of these litterboxes...from other people who hated them as well.  Here's the thing:  With the grate in, they're very cramped for even the tiniest cat.  Your cat can just deal with it for your convenience?  Not so, my friend.  Because of the cramped quarters, your cat will inevitably end up defecating or urinating on the grate...which makes the entire "sifting" action of it virtually nil.  So, as it stands, I'm yanking the grate, covering up the drawer hole, and using my reliable old scoop. 
 I enjoyed his other books much more, but that's probably because I have less patience than most. Too much running around in circles here for me 
 Don't waste your time on this thing until they fix the bugs. We bought the Bratz one & it thought it was a Pawz when we took it online. After 10 or so total hours (Yes, I know what I'm doing) fighting it I gave up & took it back. Tech support is a joke. There's NOTHING in the manual or online help, only a link to tech support who sends the exact same auto response every time, and none of those responses addresses the issue. 
 First, let me say that we own many children's books that represent Chinese culture, particularly since my husband is Chinese.  So, we try to be culturally sensitive to different views of what makes a happy ending.  However, both my daughter and I found it disturbing that the adorable rice cake which had been anthropomorphized for several pages was eaten.  My daughter and I discussed how the gingerbread gets eaten in some versions too, and that this reflects different views of storytelling.  However, this did little to make her feel better for the cute eaten rice cake.  She couldn't sleep--definitely not a bedtime story.  Beware if you are used to sanitized fairy tales 
 Let me first start by saying, I have a sense of humor. The joke was on me for believing the great reviews I read before purchasing this novel--not funny.  I did not connect with any of the characters. I begin reading, then stopped...I picked up the book again and was bored to tears.  I want my money back!! 
 There's "scientific" hype attached to this argument, but it's the same stuff we've been treated to since the earliest attempts by Europeans to rationalize colonialism and slavery. When you've got some moron blathering about "communist propaganda" in a short review lauding this book, you know this is just red meat for the  dogs. And Steve Sailer is a notorious far-right apologist for racialist theories who regularly hangs his hat at the neo-racist VDARE website. If you want a taste of what's behind this line of argument and where it all leads, check them out. The fact that the author invokes breeds of dogs to rationalize his discredited theories is proof enough of how far out on a limb these guys are. I, incidentally, live in a town and a neighborhood that's as mixed ethnically as any in America and have a "racially mixed" family, so I know up close and personal how this crap is just feeding some very ugly strains in our body politic and that it has all of the scientific gravitas of one of Charles Murray's synthetic  tracts or the "Hutu" vs. "Tutsi" faux-tribal inheritance of European colonial masters that was used to justify genocide in Rwanda. Europeans aren't the only guilty parties, but any notion of European genetic superiority is a grotesque legacy  of one of history's ugliest epochs. Read "Guns, Germs and Steel" if you want to dig into the basis of human "difference" in a historical as opposed to a recycled racist context 
 My husband and I bought this with the hopes that it would keep the odor inside and we could save the money on refills.  Well, it did not control odor.  The plastic disk that is included to neutralize the odor works for about a week.  The odor escaped even when the pail was closed.  You do save money on refills at first.  But when the diapers become stinkier as the baby grows, you have to change the bag more often.  I used A LOT of baking soda and Lysol spray to help control the stink.    Also, the button on the top that opens the pail can fail easily, and it is also very easy for a child to get into once they start pulling up on things.  I would not recommend this product 
 For the novice/beginner collector, this guide will serve as a basic introduction with lots of really great pictures and general information on some modern novelty candy containers. But for advanced/serious collectors, this guide is not helpful.  The valuation on most of these items is, in my opinion, inaccurate and historically there are many great items that were not included or mentioned. The organization of the items is poor and the authors could have really used this platform to give advice and encouragement or helpful information to current/future collectors. More research was needed 
 I read this book while I was pregnant and referenced it after, and though it built up my confidence before I breast fed, it underminded it afterword.  It gives very little advice about those mom's who have major trouble (beyond typical latch on problems) and children who have medical issues that require them to have some formula. The authors persuasive yet one-sided approach made me suspicious of my doctors motives reguarding supplemetation of formula for my child for medical reasons( which thankfully I listened to the doctor in the end). It also gives little help or support to moms going back to work or those who want to be descreate about breast feeding, and does a very good job making you feel guity about any choices that may be contradictory to the authors feelings.  The author is also big on using antidotes, rather then evidence, to support her views.  However,this book does a good job in touting the benefits of breast feeding and giving you lots of information why breast milk is best, but this is information you can obtain in most breastfeedin books. I have been sucessfully nursing now for several months, and I feel that this book did very little to contribute to that. Nursing mothers need good information and support, not propaganda.  Save your money and buy the Dr. Sears book 
 If you like shallow arguements and can't think yourself out of a paper bag, this is a must read.  Bill use hate speach that will awe the stupid and make the intelligent cry out in frustration.  Remember unlike the government, Bill knows what is best for us....mainly buying his cheap products and buying these third grade readers 
 Rarely have I seen such speculative extra-Biblical theologizing in a purportedly Christian book.  Several things are commendable, such as references to the death of Christ for sinners, evangelical truths like God's sovereignty and man's accountable agency, the Trinity, Jesus' Deity, reality of the afterlife and God as Creator. There is a definite evangelistic appeal to readers to consider the claims of Christ and the abundant evidence in Scripture (Primary Order) and nature (Secondary Order) of God's powerful existence. Also evident is the author's sincerity in embracing scientific interpretation of physics data.   He is Persuaded, but alas not Persuasive in this arena.  String-theory seems to be the flesh and blood of this book's plot. Unfortunately, it is a highly hypothetical, still-in-protoresearch-phase area of physics bordering on metaphysics. It has but scanty observational, scientific-method data and a few creative equations to bolster the rare physicists who consider it even to lie within the bounds of 'True Science'. Unfortunately, the author seems to consider it well within the realm of plausibility, possibility, probability, preponderance. His pronouncements throughout the book give the impression of fait accompli. For him, String-theory is the sine qua non that is the long lost rapprochement and Unification Factor bridging the gap between physics-metaphysics and theology.  And here lies the main troubling aspect of the author's faith opinions: trying to enlist a speculative-at-best physics novelty to unravel knotty theological problems in Christian Doctrines without resorting to the Bible itself first and foremost. His extra-Biblical approach gets him deeper and deeper into hypothetical extra-dimensional realms of imagination.  For those interested in a more thorough rebuttal of the Beyond-the-Cosmos notions postulated here, check the web for the article by William Lane Craig reviewing this book pointing out the manifest errors and mal-interpretations of Scripture.  
 Found this book at a flea market and then came to Amazon to check out its original price.  This book was put together by a junior high school editor who is failing English!  The pictures are terrible -you can't use many of them for ID'g.  How they got into a book costing fifty bucks is a mystery.  The country listings are helpful, but can be found lots of places.  Don't waste your money on this one!  
 After reading his book NIGHT and being moved by Wiesel's holocaust experiences in the setting of a Nazi Concentration camp, I decided to read TWILIGHT when I saw it sitting next to NIGHT in a bookstore.  TWILIGHT turned out to be a very weird novel whose purpose I never could surmise.  I took it back to the bookstore for a refund.  I highly recommend reading Wiesel's NIGHT, but suggest avoiding TWILIGHT which is bizarre and perplexing 
 Um. I have nothing against bands that are "mainstream". That has nothing to do with their quality of sound. (granted, many mainstream bands are horrible, but they all deserve a chance, no?) Dave, though, he has never impressed me. Not that he's awful, I suppose it's okay background music...better than nothing. Just oh so mediocre.   I don't understand why is he so highly praised? Voice-wise? Eh. Nothing special. Lyrics? Hah! Music? umm... bland? it's all the same! Maybe I'm missing something?  If you like one of Dave's songs, then by all means, buy this! You can be sure your money will be spent on nearly exact replicas of that song.   Two stars because it's at least music. But that's on the high side, considering how static it is. Dave will never find a place in my cd player or in my computer. 
 I've been told by many people that this show was an American Monty Python.  While it is slightly better than SNL (Bob Odenkirk, the co-creator of this series, rarely got any of his sketches on the air while he toiled at SNL, so this show was the result), it still isn't particularly funny.  The only sketches I liked were the "burger" commercial in Season One, the Iguana sketch (Odenkirk plays an Iguana very well), and the Jesus Christ Superstar parody is really good (though not particularly funny...just well shot and edited, it feels almost like a tribute).  But other sketches drag on and on (particularly the infomercial parody), and many feel forced.  The repartee between Cross and Odenkirk doesn't really work well either.  I tried to get into this show, but just couldn't.  Sorry...  
 There are so many publishing errors in the first paperback edition (2004) of Leon Kass's book that it is almost unreadable.  It is obvious that no one even bothered to look at the book before sending it to retail.  Do a quick read of Chapter One and you will see what I mean.  Sentences are left entirely unfinished from one page to the next, leaving the reader wondering how much other text has been omitted.  Although page 35 starting with the word "nogoly" is pretty classy, my favorite example is the transition from page 37-38.  Here, Dr. Kass is begins to frame an argument, but the sentence is never completed.  Then, the next paragraph begins, "Crudely put, the argument could be stated this way."  What way?  Of course the irony is all the more poignant because this series of publishing mistakes follows Dr. Kass's meta-observation about the technology used in producing this very book.  Good stuff.  I would not be nearly as concerned had this book not been a god-send for my present research project.  But $17 later, I guess I have to track down a hardback copy in the hopes that I can actually read what Dr. Kass has written 
 The Tomtom has great features.  But I returned mine.  First, the maps are very dated.  This makes it iffy at best.  It has terrific potential, if it worked.  You can use a PDA stylus on the map sitting at home outside on batteries to plan a trip.  It's amazing.  But I wanted to plan a 600 mile trip myself using it's internal maps and waypoints.  But I tried a local test first.  I used roads as waypoints, main roads.  This way I can force the Tomtom to use MY routes.  I did not like it's choices, since it is a dated map database.  I set up a local route, and started to follow it.  It took me to the first road/waypoint no problem.  But it would not go past the first waypoint.  I would go down the road (first waypoint) then it would tell me to take a u turn!.  I did.  Then it said take another u turn.  It had me going in circles.  Perhaps it's not made to use roads as waypoints, but all indications it gave were that it would.  The manual was no help.  Support was no help.  So it went back.  I have ordered a Garmin i2.  Hope this is ok.  I have taken the same trip from SE FL USA to SC USA with a Garmin C330.  The Garmin has maps that you cannot update, but got me to my destination no problem.  I don't recommend this TomTom.  Do research.  Go to manufactures websites and look at unit manuals.  Hope this helps 
 I found this film to be quite awful. I watched it with friends and none of us found the story, dialogue or production to be of any quality whatesoever.   Heavy-handed, nauseating peddling of the idea ofthe rapture and self serving evangelical Christian messages flood this move so much that it limps along from one scene of hackneyed dialogue to another.  We ended playing a game of guessing the next line by stopping the DVD and making a guess, most of which were predicted. This will be the only way you will be intellectually challenged in this film.  One can only assume that Louis Gossett Jnr was offered large amounts of cash to appear in this film or was participating as part of some kind of punishment.  C grade film and premise 
 I used to like this film back in the late 80s but after purchasing it, reading the book and watching it again I realized that there isn't much to say that is redeeming of this film. Sure it's low budget, but the story and characters are so cheesy and NOT in a good b movie way. I guess this film will still have it's fans but after reading the book (I dont normally compare books to films because its downright impossible to compare) I found the characters just not that likeable and the ending is very ridiculous. For a film to achieve cult status isn't too hard if its a b movie but whether its a good film or not is the real question. As for me I rate this low because I find it atrocious but for it's fans, the ones out there that REALLY love this film and call it a "classic" I must say I hope some day they remake the story with better actors, effects and plotting 
 Joseph Nye keeps repeating himself: multilateralism by global American charm attack. That is simply a stupid assumption. And it is untrue of American history in foreign relations. Nye still owes some answers to European scholars of International Relations who criticized his idea. In fact that is no personal multilateral approach.. 
 In his last book, Andrew (Andy) Hargreaves takes us through the dark alley of modern education. At the end of the alley, shines his promised land of Marxism. Hargreaves political views are cleverly disguised, but still obvious. He never speaks of a Marxist society, but instead uses jargons such as "beyond the knowledge society", "social mission" and "cosmopolitan identity".  The kowledge society and related terms, such as knowledge worker and knowledge economy, were created by Peter F. Drucker and appeared in his 1969 book "The Age of Discontinuity". In his 1999 book "Management Challenges for the 21st Century", Drucker has following to say:  "Knowledge workers are rapidly becoming the largest single group in workforce of every developed country. They may already comprise two-fifths of the U.S. workforce - and a still smaller but rapidly growing proportion of the workforce of all other developed countries. It is on their productivity, above all, that the future prosperity and indeed the future survival of the developed economies will increasingly depend." (page.141).  Drucker is absolutely right, that the knowledge society aready exists, but Hargreaves eyes are focused on the society beyond, which in his opinion clearly belongs to the Marxist ideology. Following quotations make this abuntantly clear:  "Teaching beyond the knowledge society means developing a cosmopolitan identity that can build chains of caring for those who are out of sight but should never be out of mind." (page.48).  "Teaching exclusively beyond the knowledge society cultivates caring, develops character and builds cosmopolitan identity." (page.52).  "We have seen that standardized educational reform has made it almost impossible for many teachers to teach either for the knowledge society or beyond it as part of a broader social mission." (page.162).  What is the social mission of the teaching profession ? Hargreaves emphasizes this aspect of teaching:  "Teachers and others must now dedicate themselves to bringing together these two missions of teaching for the knowledge society and beyond it - making it the pinnacle of their professional purpose." (page.52).  "The standardized reforms of Ontario education offer only disincentives and discouragement to those who see their work as being about teaching beyond the knowledge economy and about creating values for good. They are squeezing the social mission out of teaching." (page.96).  As previously noted, one of the expressions that Hargreaves uses instead of Marxism is "cosmopolitan identity". In true Marxistic fashion, he keeps on striking the hot iron:  "This is what teaching beyond the knowledge society must address: developing cosmopolitan identity and humanitarian responsibility at home as well as abroad." (page.35).  "Teachers and others, therefore, must think not only of how to teach for the knowledge society, but also of how to teach beyond it, so we address other compelling human values and educational purposes in addition to those that make a profit - purposes concerned with character, community, democracy and cosmopolitan identity." (page.43).  It is disturbing, that Hargreaves goes so far out on the Marxist limb, that his book is more of a political declaration, than an analysis of education. I believe that John Locke (1632-1704), Auguste Comte (1798-1857) and John Dewey (1859-1952) would have agreed with me. 
  This is a collection of the cream of the cream of the Great American Songbook by a rock'n'roll singer who contributes nothing at all to American culture. This rate #1 is to express my deep deception about the successful album series.  Over exposed material which has been treated so many different ways by so many different vocalists with artistry should be treated respectfully.  I am not a dictator but I would vote for a Law that would impose respect for some art expressions which represents the treasure of American culture.  More than that, the series success reflects lack of understanding of the music context by people who should search for entertainment in a more valid and truer way.  That's the deal: there is truth missing, there is a sensation of a money-make production. Mellow and arrangements, neglectable performances, lacking creativeness. To be completely forgotten some years ahead. 
 Some of the stuff in here was really screwy. It's not a handbook to the "Food and Mood" book by Elizabeth Somer, which is what I thought it was when I bought it. It's a separate program entirely. This one is too woozy and non-Western for me. Very little hard data to back up what they say, just kind of fruity and flowery 
 This CD is so boring. Sarah McLachlan has written / performed songs before that have set people alight with her passion, her intensity, her hurt, etc... these are very TIRED renditions of all-too-familiar Christmas songs. Sure, I can stomach a Kenny Rogers Christmas, for some reason it just seems to make sense. But Sarah McLachlan putting out a Christmas album seems to be nothing more than a combination of not having new material of her own and needing some more bucks. Excuse my frankness, but this album is very disappointing 
 Unlike the other reviewers, I found this book to be less than helpful.  Yes, it does talk some about different literary-related fields, and I stress some, but the book lacks serious discussion of those careers.  Plus, it gives limited resources for finding out more information....no websites and no mention of other literary career-related books.  It only lists a few professional associations for each career.  Also, there were no surprises as to which careers were selected, such as...becoming a librarian.  If you just want a taste of what literary careers are out there, this book is worth a skim at your local bookstore, but if you really want to find out about these careers, follow up with books specifically geared toward a particular career 
  When I think of the sex pistols, I think the Monkeys did it better as a boy band. Let's face it, dears, that is all the sex pistols were: a marketing ploy. They are f-----g NSync for another generation 
 While Dr Fogel's development of the Great Awakening model of US history is interesting, and may shed some light on present cultural attitudes, I find his bright-eyed optimism for the future almost shocking. On hearing about  how thoroughly the material problems of the poor have been taken care of  already (well, in the States anyway), and how we can depend on technology  to keep on generating solutions to all problems as they arise, the food  supply will actually become more abundant even as population increases,  etc,  I ask myself what planet is this gentleman writing about? Fogel seems  to blithely assume that the economic growth of the past century can be  extrapolated into the next, even as the efficient agricultural methods he  counts on are depleting the fertility of croplands and accelerating erosion  of topsoil, as drug-resistant pathogens proliferate, and as ecosystem after  ecosystem goes to the wall (there is one paragraph on stresses to the  environment as a possible problem). How ivory a tower must such a writer  inhabit 
 Not all that useful, really.  Message is "buy mutual funds!".  In general, since the vast majority of mutual funds underperform the market, just buy index funds would be the best advice.  Most of the text is entirely useless to someone who might want to trade individual stocks.  Passages suggest that if a company seems undervalued you might want to have lunch with the CEO to go over the financials and confirm your valuation.  Oh, thanks Peter, what great advice... ("Mr. Gates, your 11 o'clock is here to discuss purchasing 15 shares") 
 this blood pressure is such a disappointment.  I am a retail pharmacist, i used to recommend this machine for patient when they ask for bp monitore.  Few month ago i purchased one for my parent, in the beginning, it work pretty well, not as good as the manual machine, but we kept it anyway.. Now this machine is useless, it's reading is a joke, u can get many different reading at one sitting.  i would never recommend this machine to any my customers nor friend.    
 Its been over two weeks and I still haven't received this order or an email saying why 
 I read this book because: of my love for old school jazz and the big "HOOPLA" over this publication! I can't say that I gained much knowledge from this book. If you are a true collector of jazz and know Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Lee Morgan, Charlie Parker, Dizzy, Wes Montgomery, Freddie Hubbard, Billie Holiday, Coltrane and others then you already know more or as much as what is written here.You've got 512 pages to tell a story about a subject so diverse and complex that I don't know how he did it and felt that justice was done! What I would have preferred he did was to write several books on jazz EACH concentrating on a particular era. That way I think the public would get a true and comprehensive study of our most beautiful and natural resource--jazz. Sorry but I can't offer a rating higher than 2 - 2 1/2 stars 
 I really didn't like this book to say the least.  I didn't like the way it was written.  I didn't like the story line at all.  None of it made much of any sense and much of it seemed to contradict some basic Jedi guidelines.  I was looking forward to reading this I thought it would go more into the relationship between Obi-Wan and Anakin a few years after Episode 1.  I thought it might include some insight on Padawan training.  I couldn't have been more disappointed.  Overall it was a really stupid story that wasn't at all believable, even in the realm of the Star Wars universe.  Just bad.  It does have a couple relevant story lines that you might want to know if you plan on or do read all the Star Wars books published. I would only read this if you are one of those people, otherwise I would definitely recommend skipping this one 
 The movie had potential: good cast and interesting plot.  Its the kind of movie you want to like, but just can't.  I did not find it all that funny or romanic.  It seemed that the mother and a bride's maid were suppose to be funny characters but I found neither very amusing.  I have no idea why the two main characters fell in love with each other; this is by far the biggest weakness of the movie.  Their relationship is not developed well at all.  As another reviewer noticed, there is a bit of Pretty Woman here, as Dermot plays a male escort.  For whatever reason, Julia Roberts as a hooker is cute, whereas Dermot is not.  I found is pretty disgusting that Messing falls for a male prostitute.  There is a lot of crude sexual humor that I didn't care for.  My favorite aspect of the movie was that most of it takes place in the English countryside, which is really beautiful.  Its not a terrible movie, but I would be upset if I paid $10 to see it in the theater 
 Okay, it's not that ________ bad, but this cd really is forgettable.  It's not horrible, but especially the later half, it's _______ forgettable.  Maybe it was because it was the debut, or because there was no lars, or because that Brett Reed coudln't play for _____, when he first started.  Who knows?  IT dosen't matter, it's  weak compared to the later stuff.  This albuym has some rather great tracks.  Rats In The Hallway, Get Out of my Way, Hyena, Detroit.  Wait, that's it.  A few tracks are decent, evedrything else is complete _____. The really stupid The Bottle has one of the worst choruses I have ever heard.   There's nothing wrong with raw music, but raw can be boring.  Like H elter Skelter from The BEatles (fine, the White ALbum, I hate using that _______ title), this album is boring.  It's just a tad better than the sellout piece of flaming _____ ....And Out Come The Wolves.  Rancid defintly have better.  Try their other albums intead, and just download the good songs and move on.  Your not missing much 
 Changing Minds is very disappointing - average to very poor writing, poor development of ideas, ideas that have been shown to be weak or invalid constructs, and very little substance.  You will learn very little about how to change anyone's mind or your own.  Reading this book and finishing it is a grind 
 I lived in Germany a few years ago and found this book in a train station.  Someone had just walked off and left it.  After about ten pages, realizing that Pynchon was an intellectual rip-off artist, I secured it a trash can where no one could find it.  I like to think I protect the public from pollution.  
 When Longwave released Strangest Things, they got a fantastic production sound and had a great batch of songs. I saw them live and, while the show was energetic and respectable, I would hardly call it the "best live show around" as the previous reviewer suggests. Shannon Ferguson *is* a talented and inventive guitarist and gets good sound live. However, anyone who compares Longwave to Ride never saw Ride play live. That's like comparing a Perry Como show to the Clash, circa 1978. But I digress. Unfortunately, the sound on this EP, and the first two tracks in particular is muddy and very disappointing. The vocals on "Life of the Party" sound as though they were recorded underwater!  Steve Schiltz has a good voice, so it's puzzling why they'd want to mess with the sound this much. Perhaps they're hoping to hide the lack of substance behind layers of "style". I expected big things and growth from Longwave and bought this EP without hearing it.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  If you really want to hear some cool sounds out of NYC these days, check out Ambulance Ltd. or Robbers On High Street, or just wait for the new Interpol CD. Longwave's rhythm section has recently jumped ship, and so has this fan 
 Professor Ellis is a very intelligent man, but he plays fast and loose with the facts, and sometimes he uses his gift for writing prose in ways that mislead the reader especially in, American Sphinx.  Ellis has obviously covered all of the ground with regard to what is known about Jefferson--but he doesn't objectively present all of the factual scholarship existing about our 3rd President.   If you want to know more of the detail of what was all involved with Sally Hemings, you MUST read Douglass Adair's essay "The Jefferson Scandals."  This essay is found in the book: Fame of the Founding Fathers: Essays by Douglass Adair.  Published by W.W. Norton.  Sally Hemings was the daughter of Jefferson's father-in-law; and Sally's lover was not T.J. but T.J.'s nephew (his sister's son).  That's why Jefferson never talked about the "scandal" because his close family relatives were involved; however, not the way Prof. Ellis says.  The unfortunate fact is that Prof. Ellis mentions Douglass Adair in American Sphinx, but he never mentions Adair's research (which Ellis cannot reasonably be ignorant of) on the alleged Sally Hemings-Thomas Jefferson liason.  It's obvious from American Sphinx that Ellis has read Adair's essays.  Prof. Ellis must know that the best evidence exonerates Thomas Jefferson, but he never tells us about that. The well publicized DNA test does NOT prove TJ was the father of any of Hemings' children.  TJ never fathered any children with Hemings and Ellis knows it. Prof. Ellis is intellectually dishonest on this point, and on many other points of Jefferson's life.  Too bad because he would otherwise have written a tour-de-force.  Instead it's a tour-de-FRAUD 
 Obtuse, ill-concieved, and at times poorly organized, this book was the bane of my undergraduate Medieval EuropeClass... I found it to have little value in understanding the cult of ennobled love in Medieval Europe. Few times did I actually garner new insight about the subject, and to make matters worse, I not only had to write a paper on it, I also was not fortunate enough to purhase it on Amazon.com I bought at my campus bookstore and I ended up paying more for it 
 My wife bought this book many years ago for me, and I enjoyed it. I saw there was a new edition out, so I bought it, but it's not updated or revised, it just has the author's ex-wife's name appended to it now 
 "All life/ has song..." Stan Rice announces at the start of "Singing Yet," chaotic collection of poems from his prior three releases, plus several new poems. Rice (who sadly passed away at the end of 2002) displayed a flair for evocative imagery, but his poetry is so confusingly random that it's almost impossible to decipher.      The first parts of the book are a tangle of bizarre eroticism (comparing melons to a woman) and odd morbidity ("It is death's/drizzle we write/checks on/when we die/we bounce"). But in the "Some Lamb" section, Rice delved into some deeper, more real turf: the death of his daughter from leukemia. "We stopped beside a hole where she/was put by men who could not see."      With an actual focus, Rice's poetry shifts into aching confusion, describing his daughter's illness, death, and burial, all the emotions that came with it. Unfortunately, Rice's poetry doesn't improve after that, including in the stretch of new material at the end of the book -- while his style mellows out a little, Rice's poems are still surreal and still nonsensical. "The iceplants/turn to the sun/their purple/sadist flowers..."     Dreamlike poetry and strange images are not a problem. But Rice's poetry goes beyond strange and into incomprehensible. "Golden silver copper silk/woe is water shocked by milk/heart attack, assassin cancer/who would think these bones such dancers?" he announced at one point. Okay, whatever. Maybe it's about death. Interpret that as you will. While his poetry can be intriguing and seductive, most of the time it just seems like cool phrases tossed randomly together.      Certainly Rice can't be faulted for his lack of description. He could evoke astoundingly weird, Dali-esque images. The problem is, they seem strung together like beads. Rather than focusing on one and exploring it, he seems just to have tossed them together randomly, assuming that they will see profound despite their lack of connection. "Thunder no more, sky/big sandwich gold & coral" -- it doesn't evoke anything by itself, and it seems completely disconnected from what comes after it.      An overview of Stan Rice's poetry, with a stretch of new material, "Singing Yet" doesn't shed any more light on what went through his head. Nor does it make his random poetry any more appealing. 
 Women in Love is a well acted film mostly about people who are difficult to like doing things difficult to approve.  To its great credit this Ken Russell film is faithful to the D. H. Lawrence novel upon which it is based 
 This is the third Delphi product I have purchased for use with XM SkyFi2 system. Each Delphi product had to be returned because of problems; sound card problem, antenna connection would not maintain contact with signal, etc. The sound was very good when the systems were working. The purpose of buying the portable units was to use the SkyFi2 outside of the home. I gave up on the portable systems and now have the home kit for SkyFi2 connection to my home stereo system. So far so good. I have had it hooked-up and working one week. 
 A normal Tour of Duty lasts 1 year. For Kerry, it only lasted 4 months. And in those four months, Kerry collected a record three Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars and a Bronz Star? C'mon! If this were legitimate, Kerry would be a bigger hero than Audie Murphy!  I know it's old news now. This book was intended to be and was a political tool to help Kerry become president in 2004. Kerry lost decisively. It's over. But for Kerry to say that he did all of these things is absolute nonsense. For Douglas Brinkley to claim this as  history as like a movie producer claiming a fiction movie of a action hero (perhaps played by Chuck Norris) is history and reality too! C'mon! And there are still people giving this book five stars?   PT Barnum would be proud of the efforts of Kerry and Douglas Brinkley.   HURRY, HURRY, HURRY. COME SEE THE COMMUNIST TRAITOR JOHN KERRY WHO FINKED ONHIS COUNTRY AND HIS COMRADES. HURRY, HURRY, HURRY. COME READ ABOUT THE MYTH OF KERRY'S HEROISM ALL FABRICATED BY KERRY AND ENDORSED BY DOUGLAS BRINKLEY 
 Johnny Tremain is the absolute worst book I have ever read in my entire life, hands down. No book has filled me with such a sense of dread as I opened it like Johnny Tremain has. The way this book is written is as follows; *30 Pages of Filler *One page of plot For the entire book. That's really it. This haphazardly thown together clump of ink and pulped wood is like a swirling vortex of bad writing and mediocrity. I would not wish this book on anybody. not even my worst foes. I promise you if Amazon had a way to input stars lower then one, that vote would be mine for this book. Teachers; Don't let this be used in class. Everybody else; Spare yourself the misery and torment you would otherwise bring upon yourself by so much as reading the first paragraph 
 Ok, everyone pales next to the Great Sinatra. But there was no need for these tepid, uninspired takes on songs that are associated with Frank (I Left My Heart in San Francisco? Huh?).  The lads just don't have the feel for the songs. It comes across as exactly what it is - young singers who are being raised in the homogenized lifeless age of American Idol, who just don't understand the emotional underpinnings of the Great American Songbook, just singing notes and words. Totally bland 
 I simply thought that "The Fall of the House of Usher" was rather boring and I found myself dozing off.  I thought that "The Pit and the Pendulum" was a much better flick and a much more interesting adaptation.  In fact, I was quite disappointed with this adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's brilliant short story "Fall of the House of Usher".  While the movie provides a grim atmosphere in accordance with the Poe's story, the movie drags and never really picks up enough steam to keep one's interest...however, I found the actual story written by Poe to be quite interesting and very entertaining...perhaps that is my problem with the movie as it is not nearly as good as the story itself.  This movie "The Fall of the House of Usher" could have been much better.  Notwithstanding the poor adaptation of Poe's classic story of despair, Vincent Price, as always, was terrific in his role...still, this is not enough to make this a good adaptation.  I recommend watching the clearly superior "The Pit and the Pendulum" instead of this flick 
 I haven't progressed too far in the book, but so far I've been bothered by a few things.  While it does a good job of presenting you with dialogues and vocab at an appropriate pace, its romanization is inconsistent at best - I've often run into mysterious vowels missing the appropriate marks, making me wonder whether or not they mean to use a different word, and the book reflects a stunning lack of editing and spellchecking, each of which ought to be done especially carefully in a book that's trying to teach a foreign language.  Furthermore, questions and dialogues often include words that have not yet been taught and which are not in the glossary - one can only find them by flipping several pages forward to some other dialogue in which they're actually defined, though there's no way of knowing where this dialogue will be.  Lastly, as other commenters have noted, there's not enough korean script, especially in the answers section.  Given that I can't trust their romanization, it would be nice to see the correct responses actually written in Hangul as well.  On the plus side, for the non-perfectionist, the book is small, portable, and has enough Korean in it that if you just sit down for about 2 hours a week with it, you'll pick up a good deal.  
 I do not recomend this book to anyone, it paints a portrait of Tina Turner  quite opossite of who she really is. It tries to tell you that Tina Turner  is selfish and rude, while in reality she is just about the nicest person I  have had the pleasure to meet. This book is also full of mistakes about  Tina's life, her wigs, her tours, her temper, ect................... Don't  waste your money on this title!! 
 I dont have much to say other than I did not like this game.  I was hoping that it was going to be like Fusion Frenzy for the Xbox but it was not nearly as fun.  The controls were difficult to use and the gameplay was not very good.  Some people may like it but I didn't 
 I must say, I love this movie. The story is nice and sweet. The acting wasn't bad either. So the 1 star is not for the movie but for the DVD itself. I was so happy because I thought I got a good deal for getting this DVD for $9.99 but when I got it, the disc did not have any kind of print on the front side whatsoever like most DVD movies have. The only indication of which side goes which is a very small strip of red in the center which has the title and label in all-caps "reverse side".  And, the only special features it has is the movie trailer. So, anyone who's looking for cast/director commentaries, deleted scenes and other behind-the-scenes features, you'll not get it on this DVD 
 you have to read it in Russian. You CANNOT CANNOT CANNOT, and i repeat, CANNOT (!) read it in translation- its like trading feces for gold. That is literally what it sounds like in comparison to the original. The specificity, brutality, the sumptuous tenderness of the Russian language are all but lost in these translations of one of this century's greatest poets. Although you might enjoy what you are reading, given you do not speak Russian- you honestly cannot even BEGIN to touch the greatness of Akhmatova or any other Russian poet by reading it in translation.   I honestly don't know who came up with the concept of translating poetry- to me its barbaric. A poem is so brief, it is so immediate and so dependent upon every word- no one should ever touch it. If you want it bad enough, learn Russian. And just so you know, reading Russian poetry in its original form is MORE than worth going through the trouble of learning the language. There is nothing in the world like it- nothing. It beats Shakespeare. 
 Allan Bloom, the late translator of Plato's Republic and professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago, has assembled a partially cranky, but never the less insightful critical examination of the American University system in the post-60's era. His assessment predictably reeks of the stuffy conservatism of his mentor Leo Strauss, but that should not deter one from confronting his arguments. The American university, in his perception, is inundated with transitory cultural and political problems; the academy (in Plato's conception), must continually strive towards the good, it must teach what is eternal and beautiful and drop the multi-culturalism and relativism of the postmodern era. Bloom is distraught about the preponderance of German philosophy in the academy, a Nietzschean rejection of morality and a Heideggerian rejection of the impact of the individual. Bloom's knowledge of history and philosophy is fair, and his arguments are not totally grounded in neo-conservatism (he rejects the legitimacy of the MBA), yet at the same time his book often comes across as an old man's rant. He does not value the creativity and individuality of the student intellect, and he may ultimately just be afraid of the black panthers. On the contrary, I suspect that his concerns may be more relevant today as the popularity of the liberal arts degree has lessened, and superficial non-fields such as feminism and multi-culturalism appear to have grounded their place in the academy for good. 
 I am a thirty-something, pretty hip, pretty shapely Californian, and there is not one pattern in this book that I would wear, let alone spend the time knitting. "Sexy" is a misnomer -- "trashy" would be better. I was hoping for some non-dumpy-looking sweaters and flattering garments, and instead I got see-through tops, peek-a-boo swimsuits, and bare midriffs galore. The only person I know who has the body to get away with this stuff is my 14-year-old niece, and her mom wouldn't let her out of the house wearing anything in this book! Save your money. Wrap yourself in cellophane and save yourself the trouble of getting out your needles. 
 Deeply disappointing in quality and quantity for this Bryson fan. I order his titles automatically, but would have passed on this had I read the reviews first and realized it was a CARE puff piece  
 Don't bother.  Characters are lifeless, plot is boring, can't believe her first book is a best seller.  Maybe it was just pure luck 
 Yeah... I can't review it if I don't have it... HORRIBLE SERVICE... I lost my 8 bucks 
 I really do like Juila London's style and appreciate her voice in romance.  I read "Beauty Queen" (second book in series) and I really enjoyed it.    "Material Girl" was a bit disappointing only because I didn't like Robin at all.  She has no redeeming qualities and was annoying to me.  Kinda like Carrie from Sex in the City.  A birdbrain who thinks the world should revolve around her.   Jake was ok.   I had such high hopes for this plot but it just didn't pan out.  Too dull and do we really care about the parents.....I know I don't.  The story didn't move along as I'd hoped.   I did like the pace of the romance however, I just didn't like the heroine.   This would not prevent me from reading other Julia London books.  I really do like her style 
 This Oxford World's Classics edition contains two appendices titled Explanatory Notes and Who's Who.  Unfortunately, they give away plot developments not only for this book but also for sequels in the Palliser Novels, of which Can You Forgive Her? is the predecessor to this work.  This seems altogether unforgivable, so I recommend you seek out another edition.  The novel itself is quite good if you have a lot of time; I was looking forward to the sequels, but now that I know so much of what is going to happen.. 
 I imported from Quicken for Mac to Quickbooks Pro for Mac and after 3 weeks of trying to make the result work, I gave up. The interface is far less intuitive than in Quicken (for example, entering vendor names by typing the first letters then scrolling through the choices with the arrow keys as in Q) does not work in QB, forcing one to guess at the exact vendor name the first time; and the imported names and addresses do not go automatically to vendors if they have been paid, and customers if they provide payments; rather they all go to an 'other names' list that, with a thousand or two names in it, cannot be simply dragged to the  correct list; rather each one has to be edited individually. When I started forming invoices and quotes for customers, I found that QB would forget the customer's address, sometimes including it and other times yielding a blank field. Also the field lengths in QB are often shorter than in Q, resulting in incomplete import of memo fields. In addition, export capabilities are negligible; one can only export transactions and other details in a proprietary format that can't be used elsewhere, unlike Q which exports in a readable and massageable format. Overall it seems that QB has been written by a different company than Q, and to a large extent the programs are not compatible even though the import from Q to QB appears at first viewing to work OK. It is better to start a new financial year with new software and enter all data in again by hand rather than try to make QB use Q data, in my view. I have switched to MYOB AccountEdge at a rather higher cost, and find that this clean start at the financial year beginning works OK for me. The MYOB product is a little clunkier than QB with more fields to fill in and numbered accounts all over the place, and its Q import is a total joke (with repeated questions on where to allocate accounts for each transaction without an explanation screen) so that import of any more than 10 transactions becomes laughable) but its export abilities are wonderful and I think its inventory control is better than QB; also, it has not yet lost invoice addresses the way QB did on me. One has to input addresses in fields before memorizing tranactions however otherwise the memorized transactions in MYOB don't update. I have found that MYOB is about as intuitive as Q when it comes to entry of payee fields etc; while QB has lost that data entry ease entirely. QB may have an advantage if your goal includes payroll however; MYOB seems to have a pretty sad service unless you are prepared to pay all of the taxes yourself. 
 Read this book after reading a simpler book on WCF. Most of the chapters in this book are disconnected. There are some good subject matter covered but they get usefull when you really write a real Service and you can get it from MSDN. I did'nt see anything like pitfalls and better approach to doing a task. Also its not very concisely written and lot of filler code. 
 I find it disheartening that so many of King's masterpieces were treated so badly in their film adaptations...and perhaps it's mostly because his books are too complex to adapt well to film...I'm not sure. Delores Claiborne, Stand By Me, Misery, Carrie, Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, and the Green Mile all did well. Then we are treated to stinkers like IT, Maximum Over-drive, Dreamcatchers, Thinner, The Running Man, Firestarter...and of course, this one.   Did I forget to mention Stephen King's own remake of The Shining? He should have settled for the original.   This film has all the feel of a made-for-tv movie or direct-to-video film...and, in fact, that's what it should have been. The film was terribly fast-paced and left out some of the more necessary plot elements of the book. They jumped into the darker elements way too quickly. There is barely a set up for the horror to come.   That they left out Norma Crandall was very disappointing as she added to Judd's character so much. He's barely even interesting in the film. Fred Gwynn turned him into a goofy, drawling, old man. Over-acted. Not subtle at all, as his character was in the book.   Ellie, the daughter, was a terrible actress. I am sure they could have found a better actress than her. She was whiny and abrasive and her lines were very forced and unnatural.   Even the cinematography was badly done. Everything is way too bright for the plot line. Too many primary colors. It felt like they were on the set of a soap opera. At least it matches the acting of the principal characters.   They tried to sew it all up with gory makeup effects, but set in the backdrop of a badly made film, it just makes the blood and gore goofy and laughable. The only way this film could be considered "scary" is with the cheap haunted-house "BOO!" scare tactics...like when a hand shoots out of the dark and grabs a shoulder.   Why would they choose Mary Lambert to direct this film? She barely had any experience as a director before this gig and most of the experience she did have was with music videos. And, as expected, beyond this flop, she has barely done anything worth mentioning. Well, except for more music videos and the follow-up stinker sequel to this film.  Let's hope the 2008 re-make is better. 
 This is the worst economics book i have ever come across in my 4 years as a student.  The book is not only colorless and boring, but it does not seem to ge the main points across.  Worse yet, the homework questions sometimes draw on information not explained in the text.  Examples are very few, and the confusion is much.  I would advise economic teachers to look elsewhere for a text 
 Being a big Russell Banks fan, I was very much looking forward to reading The Darling, a book that addresses a subject matter that is clearly a departure for Banks.  I wish he'd stuck with trailer parks and the rural working class. The only reason I finished the book was because I was so hoping something bad would happen to the heroine.  She is perhaps the least likable, least sympathetic heroine in a book I've ever read. What ever happened to writers writing what they know?  Banks using a woman as a first person narrator was a big mistake. Hannah rings so hollow to me, a supremely self-absorbed, irritating and, in many ways, dangerous person to anyone she encounters. The dialogue throughout -- particularly the trite conversations among the characters about the "sixties" -- was contrived and unreal.  I was immensely disappointed 
 Don't you all really want some kind of variety in your life. All the guys in Dipset are making the exact same songs over and over on different albums. There isn't anything original to what any of them are doing. When will you get tired of hearing about what these kats bought or what they are riding in? Most people are so wrapped in what they own that they don't even look at the skills of the rapper. Then most of the time the stuff you are mesmerized by, they don't own it they just rented it for the video. These guys have no talent and are flushing decent beats down the toilet 
 As a teacher, I read a lot of books about education and childhood development.  Real Boys is typical of most of these books in that the author takes 500-600 pages to say what he could have expressed in 100 pages.  Read the first chapter and you get the point of the whole book. 
 I usually zip through Brian Haig's books.  This one I had to force myself through.  The usual crisp dialogue that Haig uses to great effect is missing, and instead of sarcastic musings by Sean Drummond, we are treated to long treatises on the Iraq war.  The whole book seemed forced to me, and the spark of wit that I look forward to and usually enjoy died out after the first 100 pages.  If you've read other books in the series you could probably miss this one, come back to the next (hopefully more enjoyable entry), and not feel like you're missing out on anything.  Not recommended 
 For much less than the price of this lexicon, one can purchase a copy of Thayer's, AND Trenchard's vocabulary guide AND a Greek concordance.  Academic snobs make a big deal about how Thayer's lexicon is out of date because he did not have access to the papyri, but for 99% of New Testament words and meanings this is not an issue.  Trenchard's book is actually MORE helpful, in my opinion, than this or any lexicon because he simply lists every possible meaning of each word.  One way to get to the essence of a word's meaning is to look at the cognates, and Trenchard lists them all.  A Greek concordance will actually print all the NT uses of a word in Greek.  Bauer's lexicon is just not that helpful and is too wordy.   
 This book is a poor attempt at proving evolution.  While I don't believe in evoltion but do believe in natural selection, I could still give a better argument for evolution than Mr. Raymo provides.  Even though I had to endure the little evolutionary stabs he throws in to the mix here and there I did enjoy the history and the way he describes the beauty of nature. 
 I had  gotten  one other  copyof this book  in hard cover through Amazoin and expected  that  this copy would  be the same quality. I was not told that it was  a paper edition and was very disappointed in its appearance and the quality and color of the print and illustrations - altogether  very bad experience 
 I Like This Album, Especially The 10th Song "Crime Of The Century".  This Song Is Fun, And I Like It.  I Typed The Lyrics On My Computer.  In August 2002 I Sang The Song At The Boys And Girls Club Staff Member.  Some Of The Staff Members Like This Song.  I Hope I Will Sing This Song At School If There Is A Talent Show At Schoo 
 I was required to buy this book for my criminal law class (which should have told me something about my teacher).  I find that this book really just restates the same thing the casebook says, but without including cases.  I want plain language explanation and law.    I do not recommend this book.  I did try Dressler's Understanding Crim Law, and really like it 
 I detest this book. I through it out immediately after I was forced to read it for class. Never read it. The best review that I can give is: Piece of sh*t. Just don't read it 
 Hard to reference simple grammer rules, e.g., how to use quotaion marks.  Too much information on how to document computer language.  Not what I expected and not what I want...can I return this book 
 You know, the saddest thing aside from how this book needed to be reprinted due to error in logic and fact is that Christina Hoff Sommers ("equity feminist" and not what she frames a "gender feminist" who she rather unhingedly explains more or less is everybody who disagrees with her, something right out of "1984") so blatantly does precisely what she is attempting to expose a bunch of named or un-named and possibly non-existent feminists for doing: selectivism, misrepresentation, omission, appeals to emotion, composition. Though she manages to expose some myths held by some (and some, though Hoff Sommers would like you to believe all feminists - including the straw ones - believe the same thing), lets just scratch the surface on why considering what she was trying to do this book was nothing less than laughably embarrassing. Shall we?  For example with a rather apt critique, Sommers notes Naomi Wolf's incorrect statistics regarding the number of women/girls who die each year from anorexia. Okay, alright that's fine. Except she goes on to do the exact same thing saying the true (reading this book you'd think she deem herself the bastion of truth, it can get excruciating) number is -- wait for it -- 54!! Not only would this have you laughed out of any medical office, but many deaths resulting from anorexia are not known to or are from complications due to it and therefore it is not reported as such. In spirit of trying to show us "the truth", Sommers seems to forget that (or not even bother to try and find out). She selectively quotes psychologist Dr. Ann Petersen to make a point (if you want to call it that) saying the AAUW findings about girls' trouble in school was alarmist junk but, oops, conveniently neglects to include the fact that Dr. Petersen said "(evidence) suggests that increases in depressive disorders and mood are greater for girls than for boys during adolescence."  Something that would be devastating to what she is trying to sell us.  If that isn't enough, the woman flat-out lies about the `Dateline NBC' teacher who had her classroom watched as an example of if boys are called on at the expense of girls. Ms. Summers back-pattingly tries to claim the teacher was outraged by editing and not considering a disproportionate amount of boys in a move that can only be regarded as bizarre. In reality, the woman who was contacted after the "revelation" had no idea what Sommers was talking about. Well, that makes a many of us.  In attempting to debunk the belief that wife-beating was tolerated in mainstream courts and judicial rulings, she cites the fact that there was no rule of thumb ... failing, however, to disprove the fact that, yes, wife-beating was tolerated during the 19th century as "trifling" violence.   For many people, this is a sort of vindication, a Holy Grail if you will, that tells them they are right, feminists (or just people who disagree with the conservative doctrine) are wrong and that they don't have to reevaluate anything that they may not want to sacrifice their own comfort for. Its like it is too good to be true to them. And it is. Far from being an exposure on the feminists/non-conservatives who "censor" accurate information, this is essentially a temper-tantrum aimed at women and feminists - real and the straw ones she creates - who dare disagree with her. 
 My main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of Echo Park, a little area nestled next to downtown Los Angeles. I moved to Echo Park in late 2004.  It's depressing - the vicious cycle of drugs, dropping-out, and  domestic violence. And it's all here, told through the eyes of Latina teenagers. It was easy to see the woman's hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played.  I didn't care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven. I also found myself not caring about any of the characters. So-and-so gets shot, la la loo goes to jail. Whatever!  As an aside, though, the evil neighborhood druglord was called Ernesto. It turns out my next-door neighbor in real-life is also called Ernesto. Luckily, it's just a coincidence 
 I thought it was going to cover the entire aspects of the recording studio including the suitable equipments, unfortunately it was just directed toward the construction. I'm not the construction engineer so why would I care too much on the details. I think basic theory on the construction is enough and more elaboration is needed for the furniture and equipment selection 
 Received my camera today (05/22) and all items are not in the box.  I am missing hand strap, Ni-MH batteries, Battery charger and Cradle adapter.  Worse part is I DID RECEIVE A USB CABLE BUT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT SIZE AND DOESN'T FIT.  This is very frustrating.  How do I get the missing items 
  I found this book insufferable, and didn't get very far into it. His attempt at deep philosphy and poetry fell flat with me. Can't a wound simply bleed because the vein is open? Can't the surgery ever simply fix the problem, allowing the body to heal? Others, apparently, like this kind of stuff. If you don't, steer clear!  
 This book was disappointing in its lack of detail.  It doesn't really get into much depth on any topic and I just didn't learn anything from it 
 I bought both the Spanish and French versions of this CD... I am fluent in both, but my accent is not quite "perfect", so I thought this was the perfect solution to teach my kids. Was I disappointed! There is so much English involved, that it is very confusing for the younger kids; and, at least in the French version (it was soooo bad, I did not bother to open the Spanish one...) speakers are not native and have a distinct american accent. Also the recording is very low-quality, so the words are many times not clear.   Over the years, I have amassed a vast collection of CDs in French and Spanish, and so far, I have only thrown away two titles, this being one of them.   I would suggest, as MUCH better options, the Berlitz kids ADVENTURES WITH NICHOLAS for both french and spanish. A great option in Spanish for younger kids (0-4), are the DVDs by A LA VIBORA DE LA MAR (these are full immersion DVDs, in fact, they were designed for Spanish-speaking babies... but they worked wonders for my children who developed an acute ear for the language. I believe they are also available in CD format)...  As for Beth Manners... I am sorry I wasted my money. 
 Knowing Gods word and that he changes not for our sakes I really really felt that this book at some point can be very misleading against Gods word even against Jesus teachings and instructions which he laid for us all saved or not yet as of saved Jesus love teaches that God loves everyone and that he pleads with us to come to him with our problems and give him our short comings and ask him for forgiveness when we sin against our own souls and against the father however this book Echoes of the souls states that if you don't get it right the first time in this life then guess what you can take care of it in the next life time as if God has granted us not just 9 lives but several which is totally against Gods word the Bible Say's that it has been appointed once for man to die. THE FATHER also lets thoes who hear his voice and even those who disobey his voice know right off that he sends false Prophets / Psychics  to test our love and loyalty to him please read Deuteronomy 13.( I AM NOT CALLING THE WRITTER A FALSE ANYTHING I JUST DO NOT AGREE WITH THE THINGS SHE WROTE) The Bible also says to test the spirit weather if it is actually from God or Not,  The thought of believeing in a reward for good behaviour is one thing we should all hope for but the thought of being rewarded with Good for hatred behaviour and murder, and sexual immorality and child molestation, Pediphila,adultry, Satanism etc . .  ROMANS 1:22 - 32 without true repentance and forgiveness is rediculous the book suggest that you will receive as many lives as you need in order to complete what is already been put inside of each soul sence the worlds ever exsisted  COMMON COURTESY AND RESPECT FOR ONE ANOTHER AND LOVE AND NOT TO LEAVE THIS EARTH WITHOUT KNOWING AND ACCEPTING THE TRUE SACRAFICE FOR OUR SINS WHICH IS JESUS OUR LORD, SAVIOUR, AND OUR BROTHER   The Bible says there are vessels of good and vessels of evil and vessels that God created for destruction How do you get your people to repent ? Make an example out of thoes who would not listen to you HELL IS REAL and you have but one chance to get it right he is God and he can do whatever he feels will get his point a cross for those who hvae embraced this book and live life FAST and Corrupt and IMMORAL and do not believe in a Hell this scripture is for you LUKE 16:19 this man begged to have a second chance just to atleast go back and warn his brothers which was not granted to him he went to HELL Period and was able to see paradise from HELL which made his torment worse.  For thoes who believe in a heaven and a Hell but fully agree with the contents of this book this scripture is for you GALATIONS 1:6 - 9  For thoes who are strongly wondering why would God or Jesus allow such revelations from this book these scriptures are for you DEUTORONOMY 13:1 -  and LUKE 22:31 Satan has the right to test your loyalty to the Father God to see if you are a child of God or of something else in nature. If you are a child of God you will make mistakes on a dailey basis trust me but you will also grow and learn and excel above your mistake and will have your sins forgiven in Jesus name and will be called a Child of God  This book attempts to explain Homosexuality and lesbianism as follows  A Boy soul can end up in a Female Human body and a female soul can end up in a boy human body   I look at it this way either you believe in God or you Do not GOD DOESNT MAKE MISTAKES LIKE THAT HE IS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY  HE CREATED THE SOUL AND GAVE IT A BODY AND THE SOUL AND BODY A LIVING SPIRIT and given FREE WILL The best gift of love God gives all of his Children is the will to love him or reject him this is the right to choose  Now I am not saying that a young man cannot develope at some point more female traits in him then male I must go back to genetic with this one which is the fact that during ovulation there are 2 eggs released in a womans body not one remember in the Bible ADAM saw that each beast had a mate and after realizing that God put him to sleep and created WOMAN in so doing I believe that the woman of those days to quickly populate the earth had the ability to produce in every birth TWINS  In the situation of a man having more female traits then Male is simple in a single birth the contents of the second child in early stages of uteral in some cases are consumed in the 1st childs genetic code therefore the child is left feeling more female then male and grows up being put down for it NOT THE CHILDS FAULT AT ALL But here is a SCRIPTURE EVEN FOR YOU  EXODUS 15:25  HEAVEN IS A PREPARED PLACE FOR A PREPARED PEOPLE.  And with that said I leave this  Romans 12:1 - 
 I started reading this book expecting to like it - it's historical, related to Little Women, won the Pulitzer, doesn't feel like fluff, etc. However I had a really difficult time getting into the book.   For one, the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate. I've read other works from the time period she's supposed to be writing in, and rather than feeling in keeping with that era, this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus.   Also, I haven't read her other book so i didn't enter this novel with a trust for the author. Consequentally, I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women, I became defensive. She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work. In some of her character choices, such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee (I'm not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene), I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters, and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original.   The first half of the book is also really dry. This could just be my personal taste, but the first half moved so slowly! The book started to pick up about half way through. Overall, the story being told and the Civil War aspects weren't bad, and could be a decent story in their own right if she'd just speed things along at the beginning.  However, I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women. I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book, because she was really changing their characters (other than Aunt March). The choices that Brooks' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott's book.   In the afterward, Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women, even commenting how the March Family in Alcott's book isn't very interesting, and how "Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee." If she felt that way, then why use them as the basis for her book? Seen in that context, her earlier *huge* liberties with Marmee's character seem to just be a way to "stick it" to Alcott: "ha ha, look how much more realistic Marmee is now! 
 Livingston obviously wrote the follow-up to the original High Treason to "save face."  "Case Closed" by Gerald Posner exposed Livingston's lazy research, sweeping conclusions and outlandish accusations.  The book reads more like a novel than a well-researched piece of investigative journalism.  It is quite clear that Livingston came to a conclusion and then tried to bend facts to support the conclusion.  If you want to read what happened in Dallas in '63, try Gerald Posner's "Case Closed.&quot 
 This movie was NOT good at all. Other than it has beautiful people with real nice bodies,everything else is a waste of money and time 
 ALL THE BEST SONGS ARE ON OTHER ALBUMS.  This is an audio recording from multi-media presentations.  Much of the material is geared around visuals and Anderson's stage personnae.  This is like listening to a television broadcast of a football game without the picture.  You get the general idea what is going on, but you miss a lot.  It is not like listening to a football game over the radio, where the broadcasters explain what you aren't seeing.  Without the visuals to go with this CD, many of the stories and jokes come up flat.    This CD set is about 4 and a half hours long.  It was taken from several years of Anderson's live shows that eventually became the United States.  Each CD more or less covers a specific "tour".  Her back up band changes from CD to CD.  You can tell that as time goes on, she gets more famous (and maybe has more money) she is able to add more to the shows (and her backup band gets bigger).  The sound quality is amazingly good.  It is sharp and crystal clear.  There is almost no audience noise, which does help create a good atmosphere for her stories.  About 80% of the material is spoken word.  There is some music.  It is probably less than 45 minutes of the total 4 and a half hour production.  The recordings come from early in her career.  She later redid most of the best material and put in on other albums.    I would suggest getting her other CD's.  Or if you want to see her performance art work, I would suggest searching out the Home Of the Brave VHS tape (I don't think it has been released on DVD).  Don't get the Home of the Brave CD 
 This was the worst darn book I ever read.  I read it last year and never want to read it again.  It was about a person who turned into an owl and called chinese food "food of the gods."  Don't make the mistake of buying or reading this book.  It was terrible.  I hated it.  If you like dumb books, definetly buy this!!!!!!! 
 Hey, Mr. Kearney, let me tell you what I (and alot of other folks) look for in true crime books:  DON'T JUST TALK ABOUT THE TRIAL, GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND INFO ON THE PEOPLE INVOLVED!!!!!  PLEASE! This book barely had any background info on anybody involved in this book.  Instead it went over the night of Devon's murder, and other than a page or two hear and there, straight to the trial.  I disagree with the poster who thought the trial was probably 40% covered, instead I'd place it at about 75%, maybe more. And if that wasn't bad enough, it seemed like in the trial phase certain things were said over and over again. If you're into a blow by blow account of trials you'd enjoy this book.  As for me, I was so stoked to get this book, okay with the first part, started getting a little unhappy towards the middle, and finally I just gave up.  I couldn't even finish it. I don't think I'll ever buy another one of his books 
 Years ago, a group of children playing accidently kill one of their friends, and decide to keep a secret. Years later when they're all in high school, the girls twin brother exacts bloody revenge against them. Your typical 80s horror film, not very notable other than Leslie Nielsen, and Jamie Lee Curtis. This is one prom, better left unattended 
 Just received this trimmer DO NOT BUY !! weak cutters and it constantly pulls at your beard what do you expect for 9 bucks! 
 I have not yet received this item.  Hopefully, it is on its way.  It has been over three weeks 
 I think this book had a boring ending it ended as if it was a movie that was going to have a sequel to it. There was no point to the ending of the book. The only thing I liked about the book was that it showed that no matter what race anyone was they should get along. All in All this book did not interest me 
 My son is bright but not brilliant - gets A's and B's in Honors courses but hasn't taken any AP or IB courses. He loves to play sports but isn't good enough to be on his high school teams. He tried a few clubs but nothing interested him enough to get involved. He's your average kid who spends his free time with a group of friends, playing pickup games of different sports,   video games and poker. He's never had a unique passion or hobby. After reading this book, I became depressed 
 This book is not for people of color.  Paula Begoun only devotes 10 pages to information regarding black hair, and actually has the audicity to say, "Suffice it to say that the natural state of black hair is currently not an acceptable fashion statement for women of color."  IS SHE CRAZY??? This statement is extremely offensive. (Would anyone ever say almond shaped eyes are unacceptable on asian people?)  This is a part of our genetics and our looks. Does Paula notice all of the models, actresses, singers and even politicians who are black (women) who wear their hair natural???  Even white people and asian people try to braid/lock their hair to look like ours!!  If she thinks natural black hair is unacceptable, then she should not write books abour hair care, and go live by herself on an island (which is obviously where she has been).  Paula sweetie, stop sniffing hair care products.. 
 I'll put my opinion first, so there won't be any doubt in your mind.  I don't believe that you can write useful books about national character.  Is there really such a thing as "national character"? People are  just too different, too unpredictable. How well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you ?  How well can you predict what  people in your own country will do ?  Would every Italian, if they could  write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ?  I seriously doubt  it.  So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man's views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million Italians.  After reading it, I felt even more strongly  that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time.  An  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?   Anthropologists have  been concerned, for many years, in getting the "inside view"--the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it.  While Barzini is  indisputable Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign  visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why  they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think.   This is not a successful gambit.  Cultures are based on many general  factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family,  etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific.  Barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the  state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily  and the Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy's long domination by  foreigners.  But nothing really connects.  There are only superficial,  scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp.  The reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes.  Barzini is at his best when describing the  lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history.   These sections were well-written and interesting.  But his portrayal of  Italian "character" is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately,  unconvincing.  Finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to  this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page.  Myself, I  got pretty tired of those lists.  If you want to know something useful  about Italy, read another book.  If you just want entertainment, which  might support any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could  be for you 
 I got two of these shower heads and they were both defective.  I returned the first one, got another, and it was defective too.  I would not recommend this product at all 
 As other reviewers have noted, this product emits a light that is too dim for easy reading.  Also, the wavy pattern it produces is visually distracting.  LightWedge customer service will NEVER admit that anything might be wrong with their products or that individual customers might find their products unsatisfactory.  I recommend that you do not buy this book light.    
 The author spent his entire life in journalism and not academia and it shows in the book.  The book is written at the 8th grade reading and intellectual level, which accounts for its popularity.  The book is a collection of interesting tidbits about the ancient Greek world that the author collected in his hobby reading.  An analogy would be describing a religious belief system by the sequence of body postures used by the worshippers and ignoring their intellectual beliefs about the spiritual world.  There is a total lack of academic rigor.  The author tells you what to think instead of presenting the evidence and making you think for yourself.  What is worse is the absent material.  The author totally ignores the usually understood reason for the trial being revenge from a high level public official that Socrates frequently publicly ridiculed for being incompetent.  Another journalist aspect is the occasional political propaganda presented.  Watch out for irrelevant and false references to the current world and notice how they are presented as proof by blatant assertion 
 I bought this mic in December and after only two nights of singing, it completely died!  What a complete disappointment.  Save your money!  
 It's in black and white but it ain't no Manhattan. With a little luck on Allen's side, this movie will be quickly and completely forgotten. Celebrity should disappear into the void never to be stocked on a dvd rental shelf again.  Branagh looks either miserable or in phyical pain as he desperately tries to mimic Allen and keep up with the terrible script. The script is awful, often unfollowable, and the casting irresponsible. Too many celebrity actors with not enough to do. The movie has a sour, whiny feel about it. Allen is getting rather grouchy in his old age and it's not helping him make good movies.  
 Weather Report made many interesting (and some great) albums during their career, whether or not they fit cleanly into the "jazz" category. However, this album is neither interesting nor even good. Sadly enough, despite the considerable talents of the musicians (Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul and Jaco Pastorius!!) this album consists largely of experiments that DON'T work.   Granted, there is an interesting moment here and there...but be forewarned. Even if you have no problem with so-called "commercial" music (and as an admirer of Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, the Beatles, etc.; I don't) this is not the Weather Report recording to get. "Black Market" and "Heavy Weather" are much better choices for Weather Report's "commercial" albums. 
 This insight into TV journalism is about as interesting as a look into my parent's vacation to Florida. O'Reilly was obviously under the mistaken impression that his life in journalism and the places he traveled to were somehow fascinating enough to make into a work of fiction (or a work of anything, for that matter).  And his main character: Tommy O'Malley (wasn't he one of the Aristocats?) About as dull and dumb as a bag of hammers (which someone ought to whack O'Reilly in the groin with). To sum up in a forthright, no-spin manner: this book sucks. I should have seen it coming, when my bid for eight dollars on Ebay was the only bid for five days, and turned out to be the winning bid (though, "winning" is hardly the term I'd use after listening to this piece of garbage). Since O'Reilly's a fan of torture, he ought to donate this audio CD for use in interrogating prisoners, if the Geneva Convention will allow it 
 "The Goal" was a great book but Goldratt is trying to continue to cash in on that success with this book.  It is remarkably poorly written and an absolute waste of time.  Not one new useful piece of knowledge in this book 
 If this is your first beading book you might find useful information here. If you've been beading for some time this book offers nothing, the projects are way too simple, more for kids than adults. It feels that the author is only starting with beading herself, she has not learned enough to teach others. There are so much better beading books out there, don't waste your money on this 
 Firstly, I have been a big fan of the aurora engine for PC based RPG games.  I loved BG 1 and 2 plus the first IWD but the sequal to which I found, to be honest, awful.  I was raised with the 2nd edition rule set and I have never played the 3rd (with the exception of NWN) but the fact that this game is based on the newer set of rules didn't bother me much.  It's a computer game after all, the exact mechanics of the system I dont have to understand.  The thing that did bother me about this game is the fact that it was one big battle after another.  Your commanders send you on endless suicide runs.  It got to the point where I could simply leave my game runing for an hour or two while my chacters could hack and slash their way through the tide of randomly spawned criters.  It got boring really fast.  Not too mention difficult as well.  The really sad part was, when I read the general plot outline, I was enthusiastic.  I have always wanted to see what would happen if the Orc races banned together in an army and attempted to invade.  But, when you and your 5 companions are the only ones on the front lines against an army... this is the point where (in pen and paper RPG's) that I tell the fellow who is hiring me to shove it 
 This reminded me of a Nancy Drew story in which Nancy gets laid, more than once.  If this seems vulgar, then prepare yourself for a big surprise if you read this book.  Contrived "in the nick of time" encounters hobble the already weak suspense, and stereotypes abound. You'll be happier with some James Lee Burke 
 If you are looking for a book on Java and UML or a book that is about UML and uses Java examples; This IS NOT THE right book. The authors give you their way of patterns or archetypes that they call it. If you already know  UML and what to see if there is other techniques or ways of extending UML  this is the right book for you. Another thins about the colors, The idea is  new but not a very good one. Often you tend to print you diagrams and show  to other people. If you depend on their way of modeling you'll have to get  a color printer and since there are text in the  colored areas you'll need  an expensive printer 
 Let me get myself straigh here first. I have always been a fan of the Artemis Fowl series even though its started to fall into ruins. I loved the first one, and it was a wicked twist to the standard fairy tale stuff i ussually have to plow through, with the protangonist antoagonizing the fairies, instead of saving them from some kind of "evil" foe. Also the fairies were pretty cool, and had all of the problems of normal people such as sexism. They were high tech and armed with laser guns. Unfortunately the author put Artemis on the helping side of the fairies which took out some of the pizzaz.  Now let me rewiew this particular book. ITs a horrible read. who in their right mind would read something about a twelwe year old kid who investigates mysteries with no new innovative concepts? no me. now add the fact that this mystery is completely absurd, i mean seriously a "barbie" doll girl who gets kids expelled from school just because they're boys. How old is the author anyways? two years old? well obviously he's not married thats for sure. I always thought that these books were aimed at 13 and 14 year olds, not four year olds. Anyways enough of that, the author also proceeds to put in someothing about a talent show and other garbage abouta possesive father. I read Colfer because he writes futuristic books, that are predominetely fantasy not preschool level books about an obssesed teen ager who doesn't even solve robberies, instead he investigates some dumb boys vs girls war.  All of the wicked humor is lost, there is no action whatsoever, the main charecter isn't a genius with wicked humor, and the book reeks of drawn of bits from the others. Heavily downgraded, adn obviously the worst parts. DO NOT EVEN READ THIS THING. get some other artemis fowl books, or read Alex Rider,. thats a very good read. 
 For a science geek like me, this book - an attempt to make physical chemistry understandable and even appealing for the intelligent layperson - misses its mark by a wide margin. Her exposition is, at times, poorly organized; Ms Cobb too frequently draws conclusions not made clear by her narrative. There are errors of language: for instance, she repeatedly refers to the logical process of 'reducio ad absurdam' (it should be 'reductio ad absurdam'). And, finally, there are careless errors of fact, perhaps aided at times by her wish to simplify the material and use a light-hearted approach. Granted she is attempting to make a difficult subject come alive for non-professional readers, but one doesn't do that by fudging the material. She does impart some interesting historical information along the way, especially about the pioneers who forged the field of physical chemistry.  But the book is a slog to read. At times one's heart leaps up at certain felicities, only to be slammed down again by the too-often illogical and inelegant writing 
 This movie is just plain awful.The combination of Jayne Mansfield, Phyllis Diller,a low budget,and rock and roll beach parties sounded like a sure bet.Instead,it's a real loser. The film is so self consciously "hip" that it ends up being entirely devoid of humor.There are zero laughs,intentional or otherwise.This is most definitly NOT some under appreciated "camp classic" If I made this film, I would disown it too.(Amazon needs to add a zero stars option 
 There is no clear organization in this book. Seems like they took many papers and at random picked paragraphs out of them. The only place they show organization is when they are introducing stuff in a chapter. Works as a reference book because you can look in the back and find the 6 or seven places your topic of interest is scattered in the book. but in general the gain of knowledge through the organization of this book is near to impossible. The authors of this book should be ashamed of themselves for doing such harm to Chemistry students 
 I WAS VERY DISSAPPOINTED WITH THIS BOOK. IN THE SECTION WHERE THEY HAVE THE INSTUCTIONS FOR BIRD HOUSES TO BUILD THEY DON'T HAVE A PICTURE OF IT. EVEN THE DRAWING IS NOT OF THE FINISHED BIRD HOUSE BUT A DRAWING WITH ALL THE PIECES UNATTACHED. I GUESS YOU HAVE TO BUILD THE THING TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. BIG HELP 
 Even though the book does embody several hints on playing the piano, two stars are still generous. The book lacks coherency and is a mind-dulling read at best. Constant attempts at humor make for twitching and disgust. It is hard to stay focused and interested in this book, no matter how ambitious the pianist. There are other great books out there that demonstrate the piano beautifully and that have a much stronger appeal. My recommendation is to keep looking and don't stop here. 
 What a scam.  While some of the principles in this book are based on truth, it is scandalous that a doctor would abuse his role in order to make a profit. Most of the strategies he claims will give miraculous results are truly just a waste of money with a tiny grain of truth at the center.  While it's true one should get enough vitamins (centrum will do just fine) and use good products to care for skin (drugstore ones are generally just as effective, and in this case more-so), using his products & strategies can only help you by convincing you to do what you already know you should - keep your face & body clean & healthy.  His brand line is a waste of money & does not even reach the status of "ordinary" 
 As I am often a harried homeschooler, the title of this book caught my eye.  There was nothing on either cover that suggested it was written from a Christian point of view.  I absolutely don't think there is anything wrong with being a Christian, but we all weave that into our daily lives (and homeschooling) in differing amounts.  This writer is high up on the weaving scale!  I don't mind some references to prayer and God, but find it distracting to have it on every page.  I just want to get down to the nitty gritty of "Balancing Your Child's Education With the Rest of Your Life".  A non-Christian person will definitely not like this book.  
 I ordered this item based on the great rating it got, yet when I received it I was unimpressed and found the size measurements to be wrong. I ordered a medium based on the manufacturer's notes yet when received found I needed a longer one. After researching how to return, since it came with no information on this, I found out you can not return this product from this store. I wanted to warn everyone before they purchase.  
  Don't get burned.  Here's why:  - Incomplete.  A lot of classic clips are missing from this set.  Blatant Example: The booklet has pictures and a small writeup on the "Keep God out of California" skit - but reading about it in the booklet is all you'll get to do, they didn't put the skit on the DVDs.  Read the rest of the reviews here for just a few of the dozens of major skits you won't get to see with this set.  - Censorship. I want to hear every damn word.  With the stunts these guys have been pulling for years, swear words and the occasional private patch are the last things Paramount needs to worry about protecting us from.  I held off on buying Volume 2 and Volume 3 because they were bleeped and blurred, and I would have passed on this box set too if I had taken the time to research this.  Shame on me.  - Format.  It's a mess, tossed together like a CKY disc.  Still fun to watch, but it should have been kept in it's original episode format, in order of air date.  Don't get any expectations of bouncing on the couch in time to the awesome intro theme, or being welcomed to the episode by Knoxville like you may be used to.  I'm ticked that I dropped a hefty chunk of money on a set that was put together with no regard for the show's legacy.  Material is either missing, edited, or censored - I'll bet those Paramount bigwigs even censored the missing skits before they dumped them from the DVD set.  What a waste of something beautiful 
 As many reviewers have indicated, this book is not nearly as good as Patterson's earlier works.  Is it possible Patterson now employs a ghost writer?  For people who enjoy thrillers, his first few books are fun. Don't bother with recent ones, though 
 January Man is a film is a must see if you need to to update your film evaluation measurement scale. It is the absolute worst. You can then use it as a benchmark to reconsider other bad movies you may have seen. As I assume many others, I was attracted to the purchase based on the superstar cast. If one were to read the fine print, however, you could get a hint that something is wrong when you see that the film lasts 1 1/2 hours only. Unfortunately I did not read the fine print.  This film is so absurd and bad that you truely need to wonder about the people who have posted the other reviews. Probably friends and family of the filmamaker 
 When I bought this book I thought it was going to give recommendations for a balanced diet that is good for your Ph levels.  What I got was an all-out assault on meat, dairy, and fruit.  Here is a very brief review of this book for anyone who doesn't have the time to fill their head full of garbage.  Your diet should basically be nothing but vegatables, grasses, and a small amount of grains.  If you eat meat, fruit, or dairy your body will become very acidic and little microorganisms will grow in your body and slowly eat you from the inside out.  You shouldn't eat more than 25 grams of protein and you don't need to worry about calcium intake because only meat-eaters need extra calcium.     This diet is only for strict vegetarians and hypochondriacs who are afraid of being eaten alive by invisible fungi if they eat meat, fruit or dairy.  This diet will make you loose weight because you're eating less than 1000 calories a day.  It will make you lose muscle mass from lack of protein and you will get the cool side effect of having green poop from all of the chlorophil.    The purpose of this book is to scare you into buying the author's supplements while taking advatage of the Ph theory and capitalizing on people's fears.  Don't be a sucker and fall for an idiotic diet that is one of the hardest diets to follow, very unbalanced, and could potentially be dangerous to your health 
 This entire album is melodically and lyrically boring.  Metaphors  are poorly executed and content just boring.  I will never listen to it again 
 I was surprised to find 4 pleasant reviews about "Madeline Says Merci" because contrary to what everyone else has written about this being a delightful book, my daughter (5) and I found it to be dull and boorish.    The principal reason for our disappointment was the absence of a plot.  Instead of a story there were discussions on the following topics:    "Hello" "Please and Thank You" "Kindness and Consideration" "Sorry" "Good Night",   Now books can be an excellent way to reinforce lessons taught at home, but usually they succeed best if they are entertaining.  In this case, one might just as well have read from Miss Manners.     So my suggestion would be that if you are looking for a first Madeline book, chose another one and don't try to combine a `lesson' with an introduction to a series.  Find a book that is fun first and later come back to this one.  "Now that you have what you desired,  The words thank you are what's required.   "You're welcome" is the thing to say After thanks have come your way 
 This is the first DS book that I have read in about 20 years & it made me realize why did I try again???????  Can I really find a book centered around a 70 year old male stud-muffin real?  I wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a 70 year old female stud muffin? I would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance.    Coop only dates 20 something's.  He has a 20 something porn star black-mailing him that she is pregnant with his child.  This doesn't bother his new girlfriend, an (early 30's) resident Pediatrician, who works in ICU with preemies at all, who tells him to "have her get an abortion".  A bit too blasï¿½ for me.  Coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful & sexy.  I had a hard time getting into this premise.    The way DS totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable.  Everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters.  Every character is, of course, extremely wealthy (even though several are hiding it). Most characters are extremely beautiful & look many years younger than they are.  I realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for DS.   
 I purchased this book with the intention of reading gritty tales of growing up in the South, not lesbian porn.  I do not have a problem with Ms. Allison's sexual preference; some of what she had to say about being a lesbian was interesting.  However, I found this book to be pornographic and disgusting.  I did not realize that 80% of this book was detailed sexual encounters.  For example, one story describes her partner urinating on her face. I do not recommend this book 
 I have to agree with everyone else.  I was really looking for a factual book on the Templars and this is a book on the Crusades.  If you are looking for a book exclusively on the Templars, look some place else.  The title is deceiving 
 This game is totally cheesy.  I was so disappointed!  It basically runs like a computer screen that shows a text question followed by the answer.  There is no scoring.  The words are not spoken.  The music is annoying.  It is a text based trivia challenge with no team play and no scoring.  Terrible as a game.  Should only be purchased if you are interested in brushing up on your 80's & 90's trivia and being bored to death in the process 
 I actually found the early part of the book dealing with the nuclear weapon okay -- not great like Cussler's books. Just okay. But there appeared to be a major change in style, going from a poor Cussler writing style to completely boring and pathetic. But I also had some sympathy for the American tycoon whose son had been killed by terrorists -- and he was the "bad guy" -- so I lost interest in finishing the book.  
 I really like Reba but she messed up so big on this CD that its pitiful.  Someone get me some Excedrin Migraine tablets please!!  I was nauseous after hearing this mess.  
 The production and performances in 'Final Stab' are good. What brings the movie down is the characters. Within the first 10 minutes of meeting this self-obsessed, apathetic group of characters, I found myself rooting for the killer. The premise of the film is basic and unoriginal. An obnoxious woman (I am being kind) puts together a mystery weekend for her just as obnoxious friends (primarily getting all of them there by extortion). She has hired an actor to play a masked killer for the evening, but alas, a real killer has invaded the evening and they all still think the deaths are just good acting. One of the funniest scenes has the Brittney Spears wannabe approached by the killer, whom she thinks is the actor, and remarks (paraphrased) "Is this going to be messy?". As the killer is stabbing her, her boyfriend is watching from a window and is seriously impressed by her 'good performance'. 'Final Stab' is not poorly made, just poorly conceived. It is difficult to like a film when there are no characters to like. This is too bad, since with some character development and a less disjointed story they could have had a good movie; the basic ingredients were there.--Bo 
 There are novels that are so bad they don't require a long review. This is such a thing. It received a star from me because there is no way I could give it a black hole. Do not waste your money. I have already pissed-away my time on this terrible exercise 
 Even if you want to believe it to be an accident, you can do better than this book. Cristol created this book based on his doctoral dissertation, which was manufactured after (and some estimate to obfuscate and diffuse) Dr. John Borne's initial doctoral dissertation on the Liberty assault which came to the conclusion Israel knew it was a US ship before they attacked.   You don't even need to open the book to know what's inside!...let's take a look at the front cover photo... The photo, claimed in the book to be provided to Cristol by the Israeli Air Force, as a gun camera photo, shows the USS Liberty flying no flag as it is attacked, with even a large splash of munition next to it. This of course reinforces Israel's claim there was no flag flying during the attack, which would then debunk the survivors' claim they had an American flag flying(and put up an even larger US flag after the first was shot down!). -It turns out, according to a photo analysis done for the Liberty survivors' website, this "is in fact a doctored view of the ship just as she tied up at the pier at Little Creek, Virginia, in July, 1967, upon her return from repairs in Malta." The photo evidence is too much to list but here is some of it:  All the vectors and even people on the ship correspond to the Little Creek dock photo. The smoke was apparently falsified - there is no smoke or fire damage in corresponding areas of the ship, in photos taken immediately after the attack. The displacement(how deep in the water the ship sets due to weight) of the Liberty during the actual attack was much greater than the Cristol image depicted, but corresponded perfectly with the Little Creek photo (after the ship was offloaded). The munition splash apparently was added to cover a tug boat that occluded a small part of the front side of the Liberty. A photo of a real wake created by the Liberty does not correspond to what was apparently a post photo wake added to the photo of the stationary Liberty. Etcetera, etcetera. Of course, the fact that there is no flag in Cristol's cover picture corresponds to the fact it is customary to take down the flag once you get into port, as the real Little Creek photo shows. So there you have it, no need to even open this book.  Sorry to say, the photo was presented as evidence in a Thames television presentation before a proper analysis and debunking was done.  This is the second book(the other is the unrelated "Hitler's Pope" by Cornwell) I've reviewed where a photo was presented as evidence, but was apparently otherwise.  If you are an Israeli apologist and want to give a better try than Cristol's book, it's not hard. But you should at least go to the survivors' website and get firsthand information so you don't look as foolish as Cristol. Now that Cristol is being dismissed, Michael Oren is the next big hope for Israeli apologists concerning Liberty. This assault is so dangerous to Israel's reputation that apologists consistently offer terminology that attempts to stop discussion on the subject rather than address concerns, such as the title of Michael Oren's writing's "USS Liberty: Case Closed". The process is consistent, first the apologist (Oren/Cristol/whoever) offers what they claim is a thorough discussion-ending report(in Oren's case even titling it as such), then the apologist goes on with a typical limited and contextually false account, then right on queue, the apologist is soon after applauded for such a "conclusive", "thorough", "definitive" account. Then eventually the apologist is dismissed by those on the other side as false after having his material reviewed, such as Cristol eventually was. Then another apologist takes over the reigns as 'lead USS Liberty reference' for the apologists, conveniently forgetting they were just supporting the last guy who who offered false claims. To some, it might seem strange Oren was given the top prize at the LA book fair for what was a rehashing the 1967 Israeli six day war in his book "Six Days of War". What Oren did conveniently offer in his newly awarded book, just as Crystol conveniently offered, was, once again, "new evidence" that the attack on the Liberty was accidental.  Of course, "Body of Secrets" author James Bamford eventually took great exception to Oren's selective Liberty account, and offers insight into Oren's personal history and his close working connections to those who apparently were connected to Israeli war crimes that the Liberty would have monitored, and that, as Bamford suggests, would have been reason to snuff out the Liberty's surveillance.  The real story, and the amazing and intriguing evidence that is now coming out is mostly coming from NSA sources. The Anti-Defamation League primarily references Cristol and NSA transcripts released in 1999 of helicopter pilots sent to the Liberty after the attack. Of course, the ADL pointing to the helicopter transmissions is misleading, as the unreleased plane and boat transmissions(those taking part in the attacks) are the relevant ones. Of course the ADL doesn't address Cristol's basic problems, such as that silly cover photo passed off as an Israeli gun camera photo.  Some amazing admissions have occured just recently(after 2000). There is still apparently a key NSA record of the attack, taken from a an NSA spyplane in the area of the attack, that is being withheld.   "Of four former NSA/CIA seniors with inside knowledge, none was aware of any agency official who dissented from the position that the attack was deliberate." - Naval Institute Proceedings  "That the attack was deliberate "just wasn't a disputed issue" within the National Security Agency" - former NSA director William Odom, 3 March 2003 interview for Naval Institute Proceedings  "...the board of inquiry (concluded) that the Israelis knew exactly what they were doing in attacking the Liberty."           -- CIA Director Richard Helms  "I can tell you for an absolute certainty (from intercepted communications) that the Israelis knew they were attacking an American ship."-- NSA Deputy Director Oliver Kirby  Write a letter to your Congressman and sign the Liberty petition, if you want the NSA record released!! 
 The authors seem to be far more interseted in vilifying the Coors family for their conservative politics than in presenting any reasonable case for  how those politics are harmful to our "democracy."  If you are  interested in reading about the family/company history of the Coors, try  Citizen Coors, a far more balanced and reasoned book 
 It is clear that Marva Collins is very passionate about teaching, and this book is inspiring in that sense.  However, it has too many cliches and many of the points made are made several times, from one chapter to the next.   It provides the reader with an increasingly irritating sense of deja vu.   It is rather poorly written - some sentences make no sense and the grammar  is incorrect in others.  It is not an easy book to get through, but can  provide the reader with an inspiration for spectacular teaching 
 I did'nt understand this book and I could'nt even get through the 1st chapter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 NOTE: MY TOPIC IS ABOUT THE WIND DONE GONE AND NOT SLAVERY(which I hate)!  Not liking the negro portrayal in GONE WITH THE WIND,Alice Randall therefore created her own version, a parody of the acclaimed southern classic.Therein lies the problem.  The trouble with parodies,it so intertwind with the original that it can be used as a sequel,a retelling or a new story with characters copied from the original but this time superior while degrading the original.So much so,readers begin to accept these false truth as the true truth.Not openly but in disguise, words like "what if" & "perhaps".Why?Because people always like scandals to famous chracters fiction or not.When that happen, a novel,even w/ the purest intent and purpose,gets butchered.  Here are some cases to prove my point & where the book failed:  1.THE PARODY/CONCEPT ITSELF-The whole purpose of this book is to show negroes aren't dumb and capable.If you read GWTW,as others call it"White-washed"&"Romantized",is in fact a love story.Plus Mitchell was trying to show how a civilization changes after a war,what better way to illustrate it than the old south?  But why portray negroes like that? Obviously these fools didn't see Aunt Pitty,Hugh Elsing or Ashley.Aren't they white,helpless,pathetic and idiots?  If you read GWTW, What about the courageousness&modesty of Pork,The industriousness &loyalty of Dilcey?What about Uncle Peter who single handly raised Charles&Melanie,who looked after and Protected Aunt Pitty?What about Rhett and Scarlett declaring Mammy as a smart old soul?Aren't these persons Negro and admirable traits?  2.MAMMY KILLING THE 3 SONS-In p.663 GWTW, a yankee tells Scarlett "do you think i can trust my babies to a negro?" She thought otherwise,and now Mammy kills Gerald's sons.Its thesame as saying negroes can't be trusted and they kill white babies and Randall was trying to show Negroes in a different light.This damages her&the book's credibility.Noble as her intent,but no good can come out of evil means.Its better to kill 10 people than 1 baby,as the saying goes.  3.GERALD/MAMMY-Check the background story of Ellen/Gerald.There can be no doubt of his fidelity.It takes a great deal of emotion for a person to get unhinged after a loved one's death.  4.CYNARA-She is an exact copy of Scarlett even their ages are thesame but this time she smart,beautiful,brown,a good mother compared to Scarlett.She even has Scarlett's strength & Rhett even prefers her.Ridiculous!if Rhett likers her than Scarlett he would've married her instead,or divorce scarlett after he have is way with her,Rhett boast of being ill-bred so his rep. wont matter.Why this nonesense of mistress and after death marriage?  The book,despite being well-written,feels like a parasite after reading created by a first-time author who wants instant fame,fortune making others accept and embrace that her work is better while destroying others hard work. If you want a book about the attrocities of slavery then buy UNCLE TOM's CABIN which is BETTER than this one.  NOTE: MY TOPIC IS ABOUT THE WIND DONE GONE AND NOT SLAVERY(which I hate)! 
 Mr. Conroy's idolization of the Colonel is obvious, but the book is slow moving, hard to follow and definitely hid his literary genius to be shared with us in his later writings 
 I so badly wanted to enjoy this book. I'm an avid reader of SF&F and mythology, and I have an endless fascination for the biological and mythological dimensions of the wolf. The author seems to have used a painfully literal interpretation of Joseph Campbell's The Hero With a Thousand Faces as a map to writing The Sight. I understand that most Young Adult fantasy is more or less a retelling of the Hero's Journey- after all, archetypes are archetypes because they are so integral to our understanding of what it is to be human- but other than the fur and feathers covering the characters, there isn't much to distinguish this work from all of those that have come before. I was most offended by the broadness of characterization. Young Adult does not translate to "stupid" or "unable to cope with complexity". I couldn't bring myself to care about or empathize with the characters at all.  The only thing worse than a novel with stick-figure characterization is a novel with stick-figure characterization and a moral axe to grind. Beliefs can be unifying and freeing- especially if they're ersatz NeoPagan- or divisive and controlling- especially if they're essentially Judeo-Christian. Next slide, please. I appreciated the effort to create a unique culture and philosophy for the animals, but the piecemeal construction and the sheer weight of pseudopsychology and new age aphorisms (is this what "wisdom" and "nobility" are supposed to sound like?) that were forced out of the animals' mouths mostly obliterated that for me 
 authors should find real jobs instead of creating witchhunt after witchhunt looking for those evil militia people who want to blow up the world.  this stuff would be laughable if it wasn't so serious. The left cries about McCarthism but is doing the exact same thing here by creating villians and devils where there are none.  Peddeling hate and fear even if based on loose facts or lies works for some 
 We enjoyed the early parts of the film because of the humor, but my friend, a survivor of Auschwitz Birkenau and a forced labor camp, was finally outraged by this treatment of the Holocaust, as was I. A child in Auschwitz would have been gassed to death immediately so there would be no chance to make a game of the camp experience! My friend would have been gassed to death, because he later found out they gassed all kids under the age of 18 soon after he left for a labor camp. Watch Divided We Fall instead! Or for a very good depiction of life in the camps, watch Fateless or The Grey Zone 
 jennifer l. hewitt thinks she is a rock star.i don't here singing and her  acting.this is not a good song,don't buy it the movie is better.this also  has another arist from the "i stll know what you did last  summer".do me a favor and don't buy this 
 There are many good things to say about this text. It is through, has great cross-references, and is relatively cheap. Sadly, however, that is pretty much where the positive ends and the negative begins.  As has been said before, the orgainzation is pretty terrible. No one section fully covers all they want to say about a particular drug, and most medical schools present it in a different fashion. I spend half my time flipping around finding the relevant section about which I want to read.  Also, is it too much to ask that medical textbooks be properly bound? A flimsy paperback with cheap binding simply won't stand up to the rigors of lugging this book back and forth to class every day.  Not Recommended 
 This book should be pulped. Maushart is entitled to her own interpretations of the literature but her analysis falls woefully short, first in her over-reliance upon feminist theories on gender oppression to explain poor or weak marriages; and second from her unwillingness to acknowledge the change happening around her. Maushart seems more of a woman with a grudge to bear than an author with a possibly important message. If her true stories were from the experiences of other women (indicating research), I, for one, might have been able to stomach her biased diatribe. Every choice comes down to a yes or no. Maushart twice said yes. If offered the choice again she should do some research before making a decision 
 There is a preview in Box set #2 , in which he makes a commercial like that of BrokeBack Mountain in which he says the final 42 episodes on DVD in Set 3..  Shame on you Mr. Judge.. only 120 episodes out of about 200+ are getting the DVD digital cut?  in the words of your own created characters..you suck!! Rent it when it comes out 8/1/2006 and reminisce what a great show it was despite Fart-knocker Mike Judge limiting his release of titles..  Mike Judge the ultimate tool..  huh huh, he said tool 
 I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK. Just because Dawn left the BSC for California in #88 doesn't mean you can replace Dawn with some girl with asthma named Abby Stevenson. If you are a big Dawn Schafer fan, but you still want to keep on reading the Baby-sitters Club books, read #98 or #99. Those books have Dawn in them. I LIKE DAWN BETTER THAN ABBY 
 no one listen to this cos87 character.bone are some biten fake rappers that need to get outta here.oh my bad...stay outta here.3 6 has been around since the late 80s and there style is all original. bone was still playin run dmc records when the triple six mafia came out and a lot of the songs they made that this mainstream cos87 dude never even heard of that you can tell bone bit off of. i bet this dude never even heard of lil glock who was with 3 6 in their mixtape  days. stupid layzie bone sounds jus like him.but anyway...this album aint even that great anyway,i was jus angered by this dudes comment 
 So I go to the video store, looking for some Italian gore movies.  I come across Torso.  I remember hearing about it, so I buy it used (the slip thing with the covers was missing, with Torso simply written on the front in red, so it was real cheap).  I go home, put it in the DVD player, and guess what comes on?  This awful piece of TV movie garbage.  It starts stupid, it ends stupid, it lacks a point, intresting writing, original (or at least different) direction, and sub-par acting.  I was mad, and the store only gave me 1/4 of what I paid for it.  To quote Hank Hill: "Dang it".  Truer words were never spoken 
 I look for Linda Howards books as soon as they come out but was dissapointed with this one.  An unbelievable plot can be entertaining but this story was to much.    
 This movie never gets off the ground, due to "political correctness", i did see it's potential wasted in almost every scene.every scene had the chance to become outragesly funny but never takes off. theres almost no nudity, none by the female lead at all, all punchline and no joke with this movie. typical politically correct movie for these days 
 The problem with this is that (as it appears to me) VillaWare has tried to cut corners by re-using all but the plates as it has on it's Panini Grill (which for the record is an excellent product - which I have given rave reviews).  Check out the Panini Grill - unless you had these products in front of you & were able to open them up, you'd never be able to tell the difference between them.  I would say, don't write off VillaWare products just because of one poor one, as I said I also own the Panini Grill & LOVE IT!!!!!!!!  However, don't waste your money on this one - I hope VillaWare does right by their respected name & pulls this off the market completely.    One thing I will say, the "audible warning sound" that was mentioned in a previous review is actually a click - the same as the Panini Grill, but listen carefully or you'll miss it 
 while not one of his best novels, tommyknockers was much better than this waste of time! jimmy smits does his best,but the underwritten screenplay does him and this movie about dead aliens and the thought control they have over a small new england town is just not worth the trouble!! SKIP IT!!!! 
 I bought the Hardcover Boxed edition published October, 1988, by Houghton Mifflin Co (Trd); ISBN: 0395489326 -- and I have to say that this edition is a disgrace.  The books are hardcovered with brown cloth and are protected by a tannish yellow cover, each with different artwork by Alan Lee.    This edition is horrible because the ink and printing is NOT really well-done.  There are hard-to-read words, smears, blotches, etc.  The paper quality is grain and has a tint of yellow in it - not recommended for white-white paper book readers.  Each book has a "Middle-Earth" foldout map at the end of the book.  These maps are terribly glued on to the back flap and are stuck close to the binding.  If you try to take the maps out, which is intended to be taken out to hang on the wall, the brown flap paper will stick and tear along with the folded map.  J.R.R. Tolkein's trilogy of the Lord of the Rings is a true masterpiece, but keeping a set that I will read over and over needs to be well-made. I do not recommend this 1988 edition because of the quality that Houghtin Mifflin printed and bounded.  The artwork covers are beautifully done and well-designed.  Everything else is fair game 
 I started reading this book expecting to like it - it's historical, related to Little Women, won the Pulitzer, doesn't feel like fluff, etc. However I had a really difficult time getting into the book.   For one, the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate. I've read other works from the time period she's supposed to be writing in, and rather than feeling in keeping with that era, this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus.   Also, I haven't read her other book so i didn't enter this novel with a trust for the author. Consequentally, I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women, I became defensive. She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work. In some of her character choices, such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee (I'm not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene), I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters, and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original.   The first half of the book is also really dry. This could just be my personal taste, but the first half moved so slowly! The book started to pick up about half way through. Overall, the story being told and the Civil War aspects weren't bad, and could be a decent story in their own right if she'd just speed things along at the beginning.  However, I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women. I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book, because she was really changing their characters (other than Aunt March). The choices that Brooks' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott's book.   In the afterward, Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women, even commenting how the March Family in Alcott's book isn't very interesting, and how "Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee." If she felt that way, then why use them as the basis for her book? Seen in that context, her earlier *huge* liberties with Marmee's character seem to just be a way to "stick it" to Alcott: "ha ha, look how much more realistic Marmee is now! 
 I found this book to be close to useless--extremely hard to figure out how it's supposed to be organized, close to impossible to find anything 
 Contorted reasoning and ridiculous proofs are used, which common sense would tell you this theory is all wrong. Also someone is correct in saying the writing is plagiarized, by someone who was a master at scripture twisting and fantasizing history. Search Anglo/British Israelism refuted for details on this folklore. Don't even mention any of this to any minority, or you will be laughed out of the country 
 I picked up this book since it was in the 25 best american novels ever written according to the New-York Times.  Initially, I was interested since the story unfolds in Africa and I knew little about that continent, however, Norman Rush's prose feels really heavy, and, in the end, it wears you out.  I don't recommend this book, instead, pick up A fine balance by Rohinton Mistry. Much better story unfolding in another country 
 What a pile of vapid tripe. Reading this book actually lowered my IQ. I quess I could've felt stupider, I could've actually paid for this book. If the overexcessive use of the terms "darling", "amazing", and "delicious" don't give you the douche-chills, then you might actually be able to plod your way through this refuse without wanting to take a hot iron to each of the characters' faces. Anyone who likes this vacuous load of landfill fodder probably thinks that Paris Hilton is a great musician 
 This book rates a one only because negative numbers aren't available.  To its credit, it has a wonderful promotional blurb and authors who exhibit a Herculean audacity in foisting literary rubbish on the unsuspecting public.  Beyond these "positives", the book represents a collection of government documents readily available to anyone with web access.  The only addition comes in the tortured syntax, misspelling, and incomprehensible rants that comprise the authors' original material before and after these documents.  To be honest, this is the first book I have ever regretted buying.  The incisive argumentation and helpful structure promised by the promo blurb do not exist apart from the internal structure of the government documents that comprise more than 90 percent of the book.  What the "producers" of this text add fails to make even their own points let alone elucidate any nuanced meanings in the documents they reproduce.    The first 24 pages of this book are a jumble of words and images that only seem to have order for the authors and perhaps their initiates. If you want to admire pictures of King Kamehameha I "the Black God of Hawaii" you're in for a treat.  This is the section for you.  There's also a nice Buddhist chant, some shout outs to friends, and an anti-war letter from a "Revered" (Reverend?) to the President.   The mental torture that awaits any foolish reader is clearly evident in what the "producers" call an abstract:   "I am bestowing upon the reader my premise (there will be a draft soon) in such a way that the reader will not ponder what I am trying to accomplish.  There has been provided a principal (sic), a basic truth or general law or doctrine (SSS) that is used as my basis for reasoning.  A position or (advantageous line) has been followed that has allowed me to arrange my point(s) in an orderly fashion.  A clear postulate (To assume or assert the truth, reality, or necessity of, especially as a basis of an argument) has been formed to give the reader a clear picture of what I am presenting.  Thus, the author shall have presented his perspective, (that art of drawing solid objects on a flat surface so as to give the reader an impression of the relative position, and size of the idea in such a way that the reader will have a clear-formed understanding of the Selective Service System after reading the manual (p. 24).  Where would we mere mortals be without such useful definitions? Note the haphazard address of the apparent thesis?  However, the introduction immediately follows on page 25 in order to help us further:  "This handbook is intended to assist you in understanding the SSS (Selective Service System) and the concept of a possible military draft.  I have researched and compiled this handbook because of the outrageous amount of misunderstanding and misinformation that I have heard possible draft dodgers, patriots, and cowards speaking of recently.  Furthermore, the alleged gangsters, blatant disrespectful (continuous use of the term n****r) 'punk bitches (guys) whom masquerade as members of gangster organizations.' These people cross all so called races, religions, and income levels and moved me to push the reinstatement of the draft.  I hear these large talking (Bi-Sexual Thug types) talking (sic) about how they will not fight in the advent of a draft.  These people do not say that they will not fight for religious or political beliefs.  These folk's cowards (and you know who I am talking about) say they will not fight because they are literally scared.  Do not be scared now.  You were not scared when you were talking about shooting unarmed citizens and all that you get from your programming.  Have not you geniuses who push the concept of being gangsters ever heard of the RICO Statutes? I can not believe the ignorance of you fools pushing the gangster images and even professing to be gangsters.  Have you not the understanding that the Federal Marshals and FBI watch you for years until you have been indicted and then you are arrested.  Think fool!  Ok, go and get your basic training when the day comes and go see the folks who the President wills you to see! You're quick to pull a gun on the streets (Nigger Hollering) New Klan Member!  Now take your ass to see whom the President has for you."  Note:  I double-checked my typing...the errors in punctuation, grammar, logic, and understanding are accurately reproduced.  With that clear outline of where the reader is headed, the book moves without further discussion into 162 pages of government documents to which few modifications have been made and to which virtually no explanation will be provided. This is followed by 17 pages excerpted from a term paper discussing language and conflict.  However, most of this section is bibliography.  These 179 pages offer virtually no explanation to explain their purpose or connection to one another.  Certainly, there is no obvious argument to support the view that the U.S. will soon reinstitute the draft.  In several of the reprints, it appears that the "producers" expect us to see hidden meanings thanks to their italicizing material.  However, the only message underscored is that the government needs people to accomplish its mission.  The section on language frequently employs "n*****s" and other derogatory terminology with little success in connecting the dots between language and conflict.    The big finale of the book follows with thanks to friends, and a reference from the "Cabalistic Encyclopedia" which presumably links the producers to God.  Their original material closes this section with a threat to "those whom for the last Eleven years have hounded me with false claims and wrong charges against me in the State of Washington you are now given a warning, (understand this is not a threat)! Should you not choose the righteous way of handling the dispute that I have made a gallant attempt to settle for some time now. I promise I will put each of you on blast" (p. 207).  As an added bonus for those who persevere in their reading, the book concludes with a "bonus" section with 15 more pages of lightly edited reprints from the Selective Service.  Suddenly, on page 225 appears a snippet of support for the idea of a new draft.  It is drawn from a neo-conservative website.  It's one page with no development, conclusion, or even apparent connection to the rest of the text.  Finally, the reader is treated to five pages of promotion for another book by the "producers."

 I used this book for the Cornell Econ 301 course, a calculus based intro to microeconomics. The professor taught everything in lecture so that the book was used only as a supplement. I read part of the book and found that it is too verbose and repetitive. The author could have explained everything in less than half of the book. The exercises are not helpful. Moreover, this little book is sold for more than a 100 dollars. Not worth the money at all. 
 I was hoping for more from this movie.  I was disappointed.  This movie had a lousy ending, and didn't even seem to end.  I couldn't believe it when the credits came up.  So the Matt Damon character gets kicked out, and makes a bold anti-semite statement at the end?  Huh?  I remember reading the description, and imagnined that the students were going to rush forward and support the Brendan Fraser character, as he's about to get kicked out, for cheating?  Huh?  Nobody showed support?  It was just a sad story, with no real feeling.  I actually disliked it more than I learned from it.  Every direction he turned there was no support. Who wants to watch that?  I agree with another reviewer.  I think the movie ran over budget, and they had to kill the last 20 minutes of filming.  Boo! 
 This phone is lovely to look at BUT... 1. The numbers on the touch pad wore off within 6 months. 2. The touchpad completely ceased to function within three years of very light use.( it was a second phone used maybe 1- 4 times a week) 3.  The receiver cord is EXTREMELY short.  
 At his best, MacLean is near the top of the pulp action genre with interesting locations and characters and a bit of romance.  "Fear", a story of revenge, misses the mark.  I never could quite connect with the protaganist and surprisingly, the ending was neither compelling or, to me, satisfying.  Other MacLean books such as "Dusty Death" and "Caravan" better display his true abilities 
 The songs are truly awful.  The voice is there, but as another reviewer said, not used, almost monotonal.  Get some writers 
 I read the prior reviews and was sold on the book. How disapointing once I got it! This book is for kids? Please, it is so lame and unatractive to children. It's black and white and boring and dull. Save your money 
 This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative 
 	I Do not recommend this book because of the characters, the lack of a clear objective and the ending, that left me depressed and unsettled. Joel was one of the characters that bothered me. I didn't like the way he handled the situation when his friend died. The way he waited before telling anyone, and they way he acted angry at his parents and the Zabrinskys for no reason at all bothered me a lot. " `Joel', She said, `are you sure you've told us everything you know?' `About what?' he demanded roughly as if he didn't understand what she meant." Another thing I disliked about the book was, there wasn't a clear plot or objective to the story. After Tony's death, the rest of the book was basically about Joel trying to tell someone about it. I found that very boring. The last thing that left a discontented feeling in my mind was the ending. By the middle of the book, I was very sad, and by the end of the book, that feeling never went away. After Tony's death I found that there was no silver lining, or feel of hope at the end. This left me unhappy. The story just sort of cut off, leaving you sad and a little confused. Those were some key reasons I do not recommend the book On My Honor. 
 This is the first time I have written a review.  In this particular case, I felt it was my responsibility to forewarn potential readers of the disturbing contents of this book.  I've read several "self help" books on subjects ranging from introversion to optimistic thinking.  I found this book to be of little help and quite disturbing.  The book is filled with tests and self evaluations.  I do not believe it is necessary to know where one falls on the optimist/pessimist scale.  Often, such tests can only further depress or make anxious an already vulnerable reader.  In Chapter 5, the author uses an extremely horrific and disturbing story to illustrate a five step process to forgiveness.  I was further sickened by the author's list of "bodily pleasures" in Chapter 7.  Rather than feeling uplifted by this book, I found myself feeling upset and outraged by the author's egotism, ignorance, perversion and insensitivity.  I caution anyone seeking advice on optimism 
 This book by Murray is little more than pompous propaganda--albeit effective politics for the right-wing. His pseudo social scientific analyses fail to hold water when backed up by more than 100 real social-scientific studies published in numerous peer-reviewed journals. As a social scientist trained in sociology and economics, I find this book offensive for its lack of objectivity, sloppy research and unsubstantiated claims. Published and marketed by wealthy corporate donors whose objectives in the 1980's were to slash social and economic safety nets from the beginning, Murray attempts to posit the work as rigorly objective, academic research. Murray argues that government aid to the poor and working class left them only deeper in poverty and because of this, the government ought to slash social spending for the good of the poor themselves and the rest of society. He ignores most of the real causes of poverty--the de-industrialization and de-unionization of much of the country along with massive federal cutbacks in housing, income, education and health assistance. Murray's book brings out the worst in society as he attempts to legitimate the lack of concern, contempt and ignorance by priviledged citizens for the underpriveledged for political gain. This book truly deserves the dust bin. 
 Although I love the Nana's brownie mint, and peanut butter flavor cookies, I found the ginger cookie disappointing.  It was too spicy to be enjoyable, and more crumbly than the other cookie flavors.  (The crumbliness is due to the gluten-free rice flour.)       Also, the ginger cookies are more fattening than the other flavors I've had:  360 calories per cookie, compared to the peanut butter at 316 per serving and the chocolate mint at 300 calories.      Note that Nana's cookies lists the calorie count as 180 per serving, but they count a serving size as half a cookie.   
 The stitching on one of my gloves didn't reach all the way around the wrist area and caused a loose fit. The padding is really thick. Some people may think that a lot of padding is a good thing - but it was too much for me. I wouldn't buy these again. Two stars instead of one because of cheap price 
 I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film.  But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor.  Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes.  And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever.  I was sorely disappointed!  If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson.  And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell.  Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days.  Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times.  This film just doesn't cut it 
 "Four Brothers" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund moviemaking career.  The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty "Boyz n the Hood" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again.  The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother.  When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.    The main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters.  By not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother (except for one embarrassingly bad Thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student), we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith, rendering the boys' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best.  The acting is uniformly flat, with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes, and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the Singleton pedigree in this area.  The boys' running around from venue to venue in their Detroit neighborhood, brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother's killer, is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque.    With nary a single moment that rings believable or true, "Four Brothers" is by-the-book filmmaking from a director who has proven that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more. 
 I have yet to actually watch more than the first 10 mins. The quality is so bad I refused to go any further. For the life of me I can see how any Studio worth its salt could release anything so poor; where has "Pride In Your Work" gone. I could hardly make out the actors in this movie. I skipped forward by chapters just to see if some change had taken place, but to my dismay there was none. I am not one of those critics always writing bad reviews, in fact this is probably my second ever. I just had to warn other buyers so they don't get shafted like I did. In all fairness the movie itself may actually be great but for me what is the use if its un-watchable. Its almost like a bad bootleg movie (I refuse to watch those too). I am sure they could have spent some more time and money to remaster it and get all the graininess out and bring clarity to this film. All in all this is just my opinion and I hope it helps someone save their money, however if you don't mind the picture quality get it because I love the Trinity Saga 
 Helen Boyd's examination of crossdressing is an interesting and detailed look at crossdressing but is a flawed, dishonest review due to her own feminist viewpoint.  On the plus side Helen does point out the wrong that is created by the guilt and shame crossdressers feel and the games and lies they deploy in order to hide their terrible secret.  On the down side Helen repeatedly throughout the book informs the reader that men are selfish jerks and women and pure angelic creatures who do their utmost to understand crossdressers.  Those involved in the crossdressing scene know this is far from the truth.  Although Helen does recognize that some women have trouble accepting their crossdressing partners she conveniently never mentions that this is actually the vast majority of women.  She makes no attempt to consider or explain why women's intolerance and contempt of crossdressing is so widespread and why only a few make any serious attempt to understand it.  Her own feminism precludes her from critiquing the abysmal record of women in accepting the needs of their crossdressing partners to access their feminine side and become happy and balanced individuals and how this can be beneficial to the partnership as a whole. This lack of introspection and the importance of changing women's understanding of masculinity is strange since the book is supposedly written for women. All women will get from the book is a long list of problems women experience with crossdressers due to their own inability to overcome their deep-seated prejudices against effeminate men.  There is no examination or advice offered how to overcome their in-built prejudices.     The further into the book you read, the more imbalanced the assessment becomes.  She devotes an entire chapter to transsexualism because a few crossdressers down progress down the transgendered continuum and decide to go full time. It is worthy of Helen to point out this fact but an entire chapter overemphasizes what is a rare event and simply plays into every women's insecurities that her partner will become a woman one day. Her lack of objectivity continues in the chapter about sexuality where she informs the reader that most crossdressers have major problems in the bedroom and later she states that knowing this, it is selfish for any crossdresser to even consider a relationship if crossdressing may somehow interfere with his ability to sexually satisfy his partner. This point I find particularly condescending since it reduces a man's role to that of a sexual servant not a loving partner.  Helen makes no attempt to compare sexual problems she hears about to the general norm for men.  If she had bothered to research this then she would have discovered that the men's sexual problems are widespread and crossdressers issues are essentially no different from regular men.        Helen's strangest statement is that her weight gain (and any weight problems experienced by the partners of crossdressers) is the result of living with a crossdresser, is a shameless deflection of her own responsibilities and insecurities. In the final chapter we are dealt with a long seminar on feminist issues and how much crossdressers could learn from feminists.  Perhaps she means that bashing the other gender is the best policy instead of trying to understand each other, which begins by understanding and dealing with your own problems first before passing comment on others.  I know that Helen is a supporter of crossdressers but until she understands that her own feminism prevents her from seeing the whole picture, her work will always be one-sided and incomplete and leaves all the blame solely at the feet of men 
 To call this an academic exercise is absurd.   It's just political polemic.   In a more intellectually honest age she would have no academic position from which to preach.  She's a patron saint of intolerance 
 What so many other reviewers are saying about the slavish similarities to--and sometimes outright copying of--Lord of the Rings are right on the mark. True, Brooks dresses his world up differently, and adds few original touches (some of which aren't bad), but in the end this story simply fails to deliver anything new or even anything worth the time it takes to get through the 700+ pages of poorly-wrought prose. As John Gardner once said, it takes an authentic junk mind to write junk fiction, and the poor quality of the sequel bears testimony that Brooks doesn't improve a great deal after his debut novel.  It's a pity, really, because Brooks's conceit of placing his fantastic tales in the far future might have provided a counterpoint to Tolkien's placing his own stories in the distant past. The races of man Brooks invents (apparently "human" is different than "man") have some potential, but they just slip into the silliest stereotypes as soon as they appear on the page. The world his characters inhabit looks large on the map, but apparently it can be traversed without any great difficulty on foot in less than a week. I got the sense that Brooks is the kind of person with a lot of ideas but without the tools to make them work. J.K. Rowling does a much better job juggling her multitudinous creations.  As mentioned earlier, I did go on to read the sequel, "The Elfstones of Shannara," based on the insistence that Brooks gets better as he goes. Maybe that's true 10-15 novels down the line, but "Elfstones" is even weaker than the first novel, probably because he made up the plot himself rather than stealing a better plot from a better writer. Don't bother with either one unless you have low standards and a lot of time to kill 
 I was very upset when I opened the CD case and saw the damages.  How did this happen?  This was a brand new CD right? I don't think so!! I should have gotten a full refund but, that is ok. I am a forgiver. I will not be ordering from Amazon again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Oh, by the way, I love Donald Lawrence, it was just a shame that his CD could not play.  Vaness 
 . . . and I use the word in its strictest sense:  "more harmful than is apparent."  The only reason Esposito has been able to rise to the heights of his profession is basically because his audience consists either of Muslims who approve of all the congratulatory things he says about Islam, or Americans who simply don't know one way or the other -- and naturally would like to believe his drivel about "the peaceful religion."  Notice that his audiences never consist of those (non-Muslims) who haved lived and traveled in the Middle East, who speak and read Arabic, who have read the Koran, or who have dealt with Muslims and Arabs for years.  Such people invariably revile Esposito and would promptly laugh him off stage.  Still, it's interesting how someone can study a subject academically for all his life and never really see it . . .  For a useful analysis of Islam without rose-colored glasses:  Robert Spencer, David Pryce-Jones, Thomas Friedman, Victor Davis Hanson, Serge Trifkovic, Bat Ye'or, Daniel Pipes -- even Bernard Lewis, if you must 
 The author did not provide a strong argument 
 The wedding kit book constantly refers to chapters you should reread in the weddings for dummies book, so if you do not own BOTH books, it's useless. The wedding planner on the cdrom is only a demo version, and only allows you to add ten guests, and expires after a few weeks. I did however find some of the standard planning forms very useful, but you could find all and more of the info included in this book online if you really wanted to save yourself the money 
 It just amazes me what a joke the music industry has become. Nowadays anyone can become a singer take for instance: Ashlee Simpson, Lindsay Lohan, and now Paris Hilton? LMAO! No seriously though, I'm still totally not sure how Paris Hilton became so famous. Yes, I know she's the Hilton Hotel Heiress, but I'm not sure why the media gives her so much attention. All she did was live off her family fortune, but now thanks to that fortune, she was able to get the right contacts, to make her own record label called "heiress records" which is a sub-label of Warner Bros. After a reality show series, modeling career, A sex tape, and a couple of roles in a few movies, what did she think to herself? I think I want to be a singer now? Apparently. And thats how this flaming pile of garbage came about. "Stars are Blind" is her first single off her debut album "Paris" and let me tell you it's nothing new or original. The song has kind of a ska beat, which I really don't think much of. Her voice sounds like when you inhale helium from a balloon, and the lyrics are mediocre. Sorry Paris , but you failed miserably as a musician. Leave this profession for the people that really have the talent 
 When i purchased this book i thought it would be more comphrensive like teach you how to read music, and the differnt fingerings you should use in the various poistions 1-7  etc. But what i found out its just a workbook for people who already know how to read music its just a book of drills. The text was very unprofessional its hand written. So if you to are looking for a manual in how to read music this isn't it look else wear. 
 I did not feel this book gave adequate information consistent with the title 
 I tried to like this book, but by page 61, I had to put it down. The main charachter, Helen, is a self-absorbed tramp and an unfit mother. She kisses people on a whim. She flirts and sleeps with anyone in town. She talks about how much she misses her daughter, who is away at camp, but I don't believe that she thinks of anyone by herself. She drops the F-bomb casually, as if that were speech becoming of a lady...which she is not. The plot is absurd. That she could be as callous and crude as she is represented to be and as popular as she is also purported to be, is impossible. This character is lewd, obstinant, selfish, childish, and impetuous. Do not pick this book up unless you admire loose women who are horrible mothers. Disgusting, and not a very funny book, either 
 In this sad excuse of a memoir Ike Turner tries and tries and tries to convince us that he is a good person. WRONG! Instead he comes off as a psychopathic obsessive fool who ruined the best thing in his life when he destroyed his relationship with the wonderful TINA. He also jumps back and forth with his opinion on TINA but hey who cares? We must remember that HE BEAT HER UP and like the old saying goes "A leopard cannot change its spots" or to quote Marlo Thomas on "Friends" "once a cheater always a cheater" Take that, Ike 
 The people rating this high must be paid to do so.  It's just riddled with historical inaccuracy ... Fuller's book on this topic is SO much better that I'm still kicking myself for buying this.    Just because I made the mistake doesn't mean you have to. 
 This book is poorly written.  Unless you know Non-profit accounting, it is not written so that you will learn anything.  I'm assuming professors use this book because of the Smithville case and for no other reason.  Honestly, I do not feel the Smithville case goes along with the book very well.  The authors should have exchanged notes a little more.  Unless it is required or you are already working in non-profit accounting, I would not buy this book 
 I purchased this item mainly to view the videos in my laptop on TV but couldnt do so coz my laptop is not detecing the cable at all. Eventhough the product claims that it works with both 4 and 7 pin s-video but doesnt do so. Please be careful that you read the complete specification of your laptop before buying this product. I am going for a 7 pin s-video cable coz my laptop has a 7 pin output but this has only 4 pins 
 I'm a fan of Gould.  I've read nearly all of his books that were collections of his monthly articles in Natural History magazine.  I like his style and topics.  However, "The Structure of Evolutionary Theory" (TSET) is not a good book.  First, it is very poorly written.  We know Gould can write plainly and clearly, since most of his Natural History books are plain and clear.  But the sentences in TSET are overly convoluted.  It is obvious that he has fallen victim to PhD-ese, whereby the author tries to impress his peers with verbosity and complexity.  "Gee, if I (the reader) cant understand it, it must be a really advanced concept!" is what Gould is shooting for.  Second, sadly, he spends a large part of the book defending his theory of Punctuated Equilibrium against attacks from its detractors.  Gould sounds very defensive in these chapters.  He takes the attacks on his pet theory way too personally.  He even accuses the attackers of being jealous.  This kind of childish petulance is not suitable for a book that is ostensibly a serious academic tome.  Sure, punctuated equilibrium is an okay concept, but let it speak for itself.  Let it get judged in the area of ideas.  But dont spend hundreds of pages begging for it to be accepted.  Third, the book does not cleary summarize major evolutionary theories.   Although he does touch on major evolutionary concepts, he does so in prose only.  This is science, so I expect numbers, charts, figures, tables.  A picture is worth a thousand words, but there are very, very few pictures in this thousand page book.  In summary, it appears that Gould is trying to establish a legacy as a serious and important scientist.  Unfortunately, he appears to suffer from some kind of inferiority syndrome:  he is afraid that history will record him as "merely" journalist that had a gift for explaining science to the layman.  The sad thing is that his popular layman books are outstanding, and he did not need to write TSET to secure his respect in my mind. 
 The video is geometrically distorted, interlaced, has blown out contrast, almost no detail at all, and horrible sound. TransFlux Films should be ashamed for putting out such poor quality work, yet including a featurette on the cover designer.  Everyone should avoid this DVD and go for the BFI double feature with L'Age D'Or, which has a watchable Un chein andalou for a change. 
 This is one of those Sony CD's that contains "XCP" spyware.  XCP was written with the intent of concealing its presence and operation from the owner of the computer, and once installed, elements of the software run continuously -- even when no Sony-BMG music CD is in use. It provides no clear uninstallation option.   Additionally, without notifying users, the software appears to contact a remote machine under your control.   Sony has shocked and angered people over this issue. Software that deceives the owner of the computer it runs upon and opens that computer up to attacks by third parties may be expected to come from malicious cyber-attacks; it is certainly not expected nor acceptable to be distributed and sold to paying customers by a major music company.   Sony should temporarily halt manufacturing CDs with XCP and reexamine "all aspects" of their "content protection initiative."   If Sony truly intends to undo the harm that they have caused, they should immediately and publicly commit to the following measures:   1) Sony should recall all CDs that contain the XCP and SunnComm MediaMax technology. It must include removing all infected CDs from store shelves as well as halting all online sales of the affected merchandise.   A recent New York Times article said that well over 2 million infected CDs with the XCP technology are in the marketplace and have yet to be sold.   2) Sony should remove from all current and future marketing materials statements like that on http://cp.sonybmg.com/xcp/english/updates.html that say the cloaking software "is not malicious and does not compromise security."   3) Sony should widely publicize the potential security and other risks associated with the XCP and SunnComm MediaMax technology to allow the 2.1 million consumers who have already purchased the CDs to make informed decisions regarding their use of those CDs. The publicity campaign should include, at a minimum, issuing a public statement describing the risks and listing every Sony CD, DVD or other product that contains XCP or SunnComm MediaMax. The publicity campaign should be advertised in a manner reasonably calculated to reach all consumers who have purchased the products, in all markets where the CDs have been sold.   4) Sony should cooperate fully with any interested manufacturer of anti-virus, anti-spyware, or similar computer security tools to facilitate the identification and complete removal of XCP and SunnComm MediaMax from the computers of those infected. In particular, Sony should publicly waive any claims it may have for investigation or removal of these tools under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and any similar laws.   5) Sony should offer to refund the purchase price of infected CDs or, at the consumer's election, provide a replacement CD that does not contain the XCP or SunnComm technology. For those consumers who choose to retain infected CDs, develop and make widely available a software update that will allow consumers to easily uninstall the technology without losing the ability to play the CD on their computers.   In addition, consumers should not be required to reveal any personally identifying information to Sony in order to access the update, as Sony is currently requiring.   6) Sony should compensate consumers for any damage to their computers caused by the infected products, including the time, effort, and expenditure required to remedy the damage or verify that their computer systems or networks were or were not altered or damaged by XCP or SunnComm MediaMax products.   I'm not buying any more Sony CD's until they do the above! 
 My teacher read this book to our class today. It was hard too follow because there were too many things going on. I do not recommend this book for kids under 10 
 Cryptic and confusing muddle of mush. If this is the "new style" of writing, we are in trouble folks. 
 The Inflammation Cure by Meggs and Svec, and The Inflammation Syndrome by Challem, both appeared in 2003 and both discuss the role of inflammation in the major diseases of our time, and the things that one can do to limit the risk of diseases related to inflammation.  Both books are easy to read.  Which to choose?  According to the prestigious Library Journal, "While Jack Challem's The Inflammation Syndrome covers similar ground [to the Inflammation Cure], his approach leans toward the faddish and sensationalist, while Meggs takes a more levelheaded approach, weaving the latest research on various diseases into a broad picture."  The thing I most prefer about Meggs' book is that it takes a comprehensive approach (including diet) to the things that affect inflammation, rather than spending the whole book just discussing the role of diet as is done in Challem's book.  Challem is a health reporter who writes and publishes The Nutrition Reporter newsletter; it is natural that he would stress diet and its consequences.  But diseases are caused and controlled by much more than our diet.  Meggs is a practicing physician who has a great deal of clinical experience with all aspects of inflammation, and who has woven many real-life cases into the book as illustrations.  So, which book should you buy?  I have little doubt that you will find The Inflammation Cure by Meggs and Svec more informative and much more useful as a reference on your shelf 
 Books are suppose to be an escape from reality not a morbid dose of it. I found it difficult to get through and the whole time I kept wondering, "When does the love story start?" There are many better books out there, don't waste your time with this one. 
 I guess it is a good market now for anything about Islam. This is all old news, looks like reworked columns. Not insightful, not fresh, just tired old stuff mainly about middle to upper class women. Save your money.   
 As a social scientist and a Christian, I found that too many of the ideas presented in this book were Biblically off base. I read this book when it first came out and found that it presented secular ideas as Christian truths. However, these ideas seem to be based on a philosophy that views the nature of human relationships as being artificial and conflictual to the point of being unnatural. While some social science theories may make this claim, these are not Biblically based ideas. For example, the authors claim that in "healthy" relationships, human identities are tangent to, but never overlap each other. This seems counter to the claims of Jesus Christ when He prayed for Christians to be unified. Here Jesus presents unity as being a condition where "...You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us...I in them, and You in Me; that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that you have sent me, and have loved them as You have loved me" (John ch. 17 vs. 21 & 23). According to the ideas presented in this book, however, I would logically conclude that someone who would make such a statement suffers from co-mingling their identify with other's identities. Furthermore, the author's ideas are not the final word about human relationships in the social sciences (psychology is one of the social sciences). I suggest that the way to improve one's relationships with other people is not through impersonal rules, as suggested by the authors. This merely results in alienation. Personally, I received more insight into human relationships from reading C. S. Lewis' book, The Four Loves 
 I was looking for something to help me remember how to read and write music (which I hadn't done in 13 years and had basically forgotten).  I was disappointed to find that this book doesn't even touch on the subject of actually reading (much less writing) music, making it all but useless for me.  Basically, most of the book is dedicated to telling about popular chord progressions.  I suppose this could be useful if you are wanting instructions on how to improvise something as unoriginal as possible and want instruction on how to do what everyone else is doing and has been done to death.  Since I could improvise since I was in elementary school and want to be able to write down what I come up with I found this to be interesting trivia about what is common in pop, blues, etc., but ultimately not useful.  If you are looking for a basic book on chord progressions this could be what you need, though.  Anyway, I barely got this and realized I need to get another book because this simply didn't give me any information I found useful -- and oh, though short I found the writing dull, wordy, and a pain to read through 
 Although the stickers are quite amusing, the picture is very misleading. The over-all size of the book is 4 inches by 6 inches. The stickers are very small and the only available space to put them is basically the front and back cover. Also the list price is $1.50 but when you add the "sourcing fee" and shipping , you're paying close to $10.000 for a few stickers 
 I bought this book hoping for new ideas to get my 4 year old interested in art.  I received nothing for my money but the author's sneers at some actions by parents and preschool teachers with respect to teaching art to children.  The author's way is the only right way, and BTW, if you didn't start when the child was a few months old, you're a lousy parent and she offers nothing to help.  I would not recommend this book, and I bought it on sale 
 This book gives prices in FF (French Francs).  France changed from Francs to Euros in 2000. Does that give you a hint of how out-dated this book is?  Granted, a lot of the information will still be valid, but much will not; needs another edition with a serious update.  Also, could use lots of photos or drawings to illustrate the points she's making (for examples, Price discusses various types of French pottery; it would be nice to see what she's talking about)  This is probably a better book for armchair travel than for actually guiding you through French flea markets.  Good luck 
 Not impressed with this one... I don't see the appeal, although I know it's a staple, supposedly.  I find the illustrations drab and unappealing, and my son never got into it, either.  
 This book is an insane rip off to the "Uglie" trilogy. If you like the idea of this book, buy "Uglies" by Scott Westerfeld.  It is twenty thousand times more plausable, imaginative, gripping, and better 
 I keep reading and listening to his books because everyone says how good they are, but I have never found this to be so.  He always strikes me as someone who potters around never really interacting with people who then goes home and writes about it.  He seems more at home studying statistics (which he includes everywhere) and drawing his own facile conclusions from these statistics.  I always imagine him stuck in his room reading his newspaper, surfing the net and smugly summing up his brief interactions with people in the real world.  All his travel books are equally awful as he never really interacts with anyone - just comments on them later.  Still lots of people think he is grea 
 I purchased this book because of the very positive reviews.  After reading the book I was quite disappointed.  The very positive reviews were not accurate.  This is not a four or five star book.  Its marginally adequate, nothing more.  The information is very generic; narrow in scope, with no great insights.  In addition to being informationally weak, I felt the author was subtly pushing several internet poker sites.  Parts of the book read more like an infomercial than an unbiased informational book.  Upon finishing the book, I was left feeling disappointed.  The book did not deliver.  As an alternative selection, I highly recommend "Winning at Internet Poker for Dummies".  Although I find the title "for Dummies" offensive, the book is excellent, offering indepth, thorough discussions of the various topics involved with internet poker.   
 What a disappointment.  I was looking forward to Anne Perry's new series, hoping for another set of lively characters and satisfying stories, driven by good writing and informed by history and period details.  But the most charitable thing I can find to say about this book is that perhaps it will have been worth slogging through if it sets up better plotting and characterization in the rest of the books in the series.  It certainly doesn't stand alone as a novel:  despite its 300+ page length, it's populated with paper-thin characters, some of whom appear only once and to no purpose, carry on interminable and uninteresting conversations (or internal monologues) that fail to advance the extremely flimsy plot, which HAS NO PAYOFF.  This book felt like Perry has become so enamored of her own prose style (which is, as ever, exemplary) that she's forgotten to give us people and a mystery (or at least a story) to care about. 
 The plot had some potential, but unfortunately we ended up with this instead. It's not cheesy, it's lame. This is one of those films where characters make really dumb decisions that make no sense, or do really stupid things in the name of trying to create some tension. So much so that the movie is more tedious and boring then anything. However, because the plot wasn't bad and the effects were pretty decent I gave it 2 stars. That said, I would have to say your not missing anything by passing this one over. 
 I've read many books in this segment and I would strongly recommend reading Hot Text: Web Writing that Works or Networds. Robert Bly is a "print guy" that thought it would be interesting to write a book on electronic copy.  I would say that the first half of the book is written by supposed experts in on-line marketing.  The book is crowded with all sorts of references to other people's work. This leads to a very choppy style of reading in my opinion.  The author uses case studies from work that he has already completed but rarely does the content match the electronic world.  For a book that is written in 2003, the data is incredibly dated. The author is comfortable with using data from 1996 in a book that talks about the ever changing environment of On-Line marketing.  Most of the data regarding internet statistics was incredibly dated. The author talks  about the principals of good copy writing but rarely goes into any depth with regards to examples of the principals.  I found the writing to be lazy to say the least.  Clearly this author is capitalizing on the interest of electronic copy.  Take out the experts that know about on-line marketing, you're left with an incredibly weak book.  Although there are is a lot of expert reference, rarely do the experts go into any depth with regards to their arguments or points.  If  this book is the only book that you are exposed to within this segment; you might be left thinking that you read an average book. When you compare the book to other books in the same segment, it simply doesn't compare.  Not a good book 
 For some reason, Amazon deleted my earlier review, although it was not obscene or offensive. So I'll restate it in really simple terms: David Brock contends that critics of the mainstream media are all narrow-minded conservatives who simply don't want to read about social trends they don't like. This is nonsense. You don't have to agree with the Christian right - I certainly don't - in order to perceive liberal bias in the media. I would give some examples, but I'd probably get censored again 
 The picture quality is okay, but the battery life is HORRIBLE 
 I received the cartridge, however it was a bad one.  They said they would send postage to send it back, and when they received it they would send a new one.  I still have not received a new one and, I have not heard from the company. It has been quite a while. I will not be buying products from this company again 
 The world of rock journalism is rife with shoddy writing, biased agendas, unfair ad hominem barbs, and sub-Nietzschean posturing. While this literary school has produced many noteworthy opinionated hacks, such as Robert Christgau, Albert Goldman, et al., Geoffrey Giuliano may very well be the prime exponent of this proud tradition.   Blackbird is, to put it simply, an utter waste of time, space and sorely needed trees. As some other reviewers have already mentioned, Giuliano's primary sources are disgruntled McCartney ex-employees, as well as the ex-wife of one of those ex-employees: of whom the author is apparently obsessed with, as he fawns over her incessantly in print, and has several pictures of her included. This is a little odd, as the book is ostensibly about Paul McCartney. (Giuliano also has numerous pictures of himself included in the photo spread, much to our collective indifference).    But it's one thing to produce a readable book that is filled with unreliable smear; it's quite another to produce an unreliable book that is rendered unreadable by sleazy, melodramatic prose. Giuliano is the veritable poster-child of such prose.  If you must read this, then be sure to check it out of your local public library. This book was, I think, the first McCartney bio, and accordingly most public libraries have a copy. And if you absolutely must buy this, then be sure to check out your local used-book store, as the one I shop at has about 7 copies of this tripe for sale.  
 Removed from the bland movie it supports, this "score" has little to recommend it. You would do well to give this one a miss and go for the original, far superior score by John Carpenter... 
 Cash MOney, if BG and Juvenile left, WTF u still hav their tracks on ur thang???? 
 I bought this book so I'd have something interesting to read during my son's tonsillectomy last fall.  I was hoping to enjoy the torrid love scenes in it!  I got half-way through the book, and it bothered me so much (my own issues getting in the way?), I put the book away.  I felt Anna was emotionally neglecting her daughter, Molly, while involved in her lustful dysfunctional relationship with Leo.  I didn't like any of the main characters, including Molly---all too unrealistic.  But I picked up the book yesterday and finished it.  The book was too flat!  Though I don't think she was a BAD mom, she certainly exercised poor judgment (and for what?  Like Leo was a good catch?)!  I wasted my time (I don't read books very often) on this story.  Yet I did read the whole book, hoping it would get better, so I'm giving it 2 stars.  I didn't think I'd get any more of Sue Miller's books, but other reviewers said she has better novels 
 As one of the Co-Founders and former Director of Guatemalan Operations for PlanetOutreach, I discovered this book was published after leaving PlanetOutreach in 2002. The author was misinformed about how our internet cafe / telecenter was actually launched and who was involved in making it happen. In fact, the author made it seem that PlanetOutreach was a project of eBay and it certainly was not, although we did receive a grant from their foundation to make it happen. Persons mentioned as being a significant part of this project came down to San Pedro to visit only; from a few days (Meg W.and Henry G.- to take a tour of the village and project) to three weeks (Griffin - who helped with painting bookshelves only). Naturally, I was stunned to see credit given to people when they played a very small role (if any!) versus the four us who founded it (Karina, Ron, Debbie and me). Naturally, I was disappointed to see how the author chose to innacurately profile this innovative enterprise.  Two of the first employees I hired and trained, Mary and Otto,  continue to stay in touch with me through email. In fact, Otto, the first employee of PlanetOutreach, and Cata, his wife, gave birth to their first daughter in 2005 and named her after me; I saw her in Sept 2005 and she's beautiful! 
 Horton is not a great writer.  By that, I mean that the flow is quite arduous to follow and you find your mind wandering a lot as you read.  A lot of sentences seem randomly placed.  And sometimes, the EXACT SAME sentence will appear in two different places.  Case in point:       in page 22 it reads - "It was chiefly the concept of covenant (with       its corollary, election) that guarded against a civil religion and       made Yahweh's will rather than national aspirations the basis for       life."       then, in page 30 (in an altogether different chapter), it reads - "It       was chiefly the concept of covenant (with its corollary, election)       that guarded against a civil religion and made Yahweh's will rather       than national aspirations the basis for life."  I'm not kidding.  The context of each sentence was completely different, and yet, the same sentence appears.  (Interestingly, both sentences have a different footnote.)  Basically, it's as if Horton randomly threw in sentences, without caring about logical flow, and once in awhile, he'll throw in the same sentence in two completely different contexts.  Writing aside, Horton does have a lot of valuable things to say in this book.  Chapter 3 on the difference between the Mosaic and Abrahamic covenants was illuminating.  But again, difficult prose made it hard to track.  For instance, in page 43, Horton argues that there is hope embedded in the Mosaic Covenant and he quotes Deut. 4:30-31.  Fair enough.  But then, the very next paragraph (pg. 44), Horton writes, "Remarkably, the rise of the monarchy is anticipated here."  What is Horton talking about?  Deut. 4:30-31 says nothing about kings.  Ah, but you later find out, by reading further along, that he was talking about Deut. 17:14-20.  But the logical flow doesn't make any sense.  Horton basically makes you struggle and juggle all sorts of random sentences before somehow, he pulls it all together after several paragraphs.  It's like reading the thoughts of an ADHD kid.  To sum it up, valuable information, but poor, convoluted prose. 
 The lack of someone lurking behind Prince's shoulder while in the recording studio and having the courage to tell him when he produces second rate nonsense has been missing since the departure of the Fargnoli management team. This is a poor track incorporating biblical references that have little relevance or sense of genuine compassion to the katrina disaster. Musically the lack of emotion conveyed by the unnecessarily complicated chord changes and irrelevant reference to Sade also make the feel of this track disjointed. While Prince fans will generally hype this track, the reality is that "4 the tears in your eyes" this isn't and to add a charity track with an instrumental showing off your musical skills is just pure self indulgence and frankly crass. Lets hope this is not an indication of the upcoming 3121.    
 This book may well have been filled with great writing, however, as a dog owner and lover, I was disgusted and depressed reading these stories.  The reviews on the book cover give little indication as to the repeated  ugliness within.  If you are a parent, imagine reading story after detached  story of babies being killed, lost and neglected.  For me, any great  writing was overshadowed by my sympathies for the dogs.  Not what I  expected and very sad 
 This book is about a man named Ray Atlee whose father has just died, leaving $3 million in unexplained cash.  Someone else knows about the money.  The three major questions for the book to answer are:  1) Where did the money come from? 2) Who is the mystery person (or people) trying to get it? 3) What will Ray do with it?  I have reached page 261 in this book, and NONE of these questions have been answered.  Ray has moved the money around, been vaguely threatened by person or persons unknown and had many conversations with side characters that all led nowhere.  261 pages in, all I know is where the money DIDN'T come from.  This is a legal thriller that does not thrill.  The pacing is deadly dull and I keep waiting, waiting, WAITING for something to happen and nothing does.  Finally I threw the book down in frustration an hour or so ago when I realized how close to 300 pages I'd gotten with nothing happening.  I don't know why I even gave the book this much of a chance.  Nothing bad has happened to him, and even though three million is at stake, none of the bad guys have taken any but the most harmless ways of trying to get it.  If they were really following him as much as it's alluded to in the book, they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash.  He spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car, for God's sake!  I may finish it one day, but as of now I just don't care about the money or the characters who are after it.  Not Grisham's best, by a long shot 
 Though well-crafted, this book is ultimately rather one-dimensional - a  750-page litany of victimization. Shilts' sledgehammer approach and  simplistic 1970s identity politics may make for effective propaganda, but  that's about it. This book sorely lacks the nuance and intelligence of  Allan Berube's "Coming Out Under Fire" - still the best book yet  published on this subject 
 the jewish state has no future without american taxpayer dollers. israel is a dieing tree americans giving israel water will just prolong the agony 
 Meticulously researched, but dry as an official communique from the Foreign Office itself.  There's a great story within the panoply of names and facts here, but Dorril wastes no time with a striking narrative.  An unfortunate loss 
      It starts out with this Mexican family illegally coming across the border into the United States. When they get to the U.S., they go to a labor camp in California. This first labor camp is probably the best one that they go to. The whole book is about this family moving around to different labor camps during different crop seasons. Every now and then, Francisco and his brother Roberto go to school. Along the way there are more people added to the family. The book doesn't really come to a good ending. It is also kind of hard to understand because it jumps three years into the future at times and then you don't know what's going on. 	This was a very good book at some times but most of the time the author put in way too many unnecessary details that make the book kind of boring. This book is exactly like it's sequel, Breaking Through. I would rate this book pretty low if like a lot of action.  
 Here's the deal scoop on this.  Lots of repeated questions, at least one blatantly wrong answer, and some ambiguous questions that will make you feel stupid for not getting it when in fact it's just a stupid question.  A lot of times the author gets lazy and will provide the following explanation as to why the answer is correct: "statement of fact".  Gee that doesn't help too much.  I guess you can get this book if you like tough love, meaning, it MAY teach you by abusing you.    Not a book for you if you don't already know the material.  Only get it if you need sample questions.  
 Aren't these the same guys who were quoted in AdWeek or Ad Age or somewhere like that blithely confessing that all the predictions made in their first book were wrong?  Maybe not, but I seem to recall.  So, they  said, just throw the first book out and buy their new book instead.  Come  on.  Visionary, smisionary.  More hypotheticals and made-up stuff.  If you  want to be provoked, Faith Popcorn is about as much of this kind of fluff  as you need 
 This has got to be the absolutely the sickest bottom of the heap horror movie ever made. You have been warned 
 This product does not come with a screen cover.  Sure, it doesn't say it has one in the description, but what's the point of having an iPod case if it doesn't protect the screen 
 Talk about overrated. Don't trust the reviewers on this one. I have seen Swan Lake performed live several times, including by American Ballet Theater in New York and Royal Ballet at Covent Garden in London. This DVD is a pale immitation of those productions. The dancing is ok, but uninspired. The production values look dated. And Ms. Hart is certainly no Maya Plisetskaya, the best Odette/Odile ever. If you can find a video of her in SWAN LAKE, get it. If not, I'd suggest going with a DVD of an established ballet company like ABT, Royal Ballet, the Kirov or the Bolshoi 
 Feels like sleeping on a rock, hard like a rock. I wake up everyday with a headache. I slept much better with my old, 10 year old pillow 
 He doesn't deserve that Nobel.... It was a political decision 
 The most depressing thing about a book like this is not the outrageously inaccurate content, but, based on the high ratings and adulatory comments by other reviewers, that most people actually believe this drivel. How can we possibly form an effective energy policy when the citizenry are not only uninformed but ill-informed? The answer is that we cannot. I will not bother to go through a detailed criticism, not only because it would take an almost book length document to do it, but because, in the highly politicized atmosphere we live in, no one would believe it. Today, the "truth" depends much more on one's political views than on an objective evaluation of the evidence. 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 This 600+ page endeavor in tedium has quite a few clever and witty observations about the current state of media, technology, etc., but is undone by the author's endless tone of self-congratulation and his complete inability to MOVE THE STORY ALONG. The plight of George and Lizzie is secondary to all of Andersen's cheeky observations and endless descriptive dreck. There's no sense rehashing the plot because there really isn't one. For a story intending to portray life in the modern fast lane, so little seems to actually happen, and it's hard to care about any of the characters since they serve mainly as props and time-killers in between the author's next clever zinger. Most of the time, the author's supposedly keen insight into the 21st century is no more than well-dressed but thinly-veiled cliches (this is particularly prevalent - and annoying - when the author shifts the setting out of New York City to the West Coast and shows his complete ignorance of anything outside the 212 area code), and you get the distinct impression that the author is writing just to hear himself talk. Fresh and invigorated at the start, it doesn't take long for Turn of the Century to wear thin and dwindle to a boring, lethargic crawl. All in all, a very disappointing read, since I was always a fan of his work in Spy Magazine. This is precisely the kind of "hip, cutting edge" fiction - with it's media barbs and heavy handed approach to social satire - which would fool critics into thinking the author really had something to say 
 Interesting premise, but the plot is like swiss cheese.  This review will just be a point by point of all the major things that I found so implausable that I couldn't just suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride. Spoilers alert.  I wasn't able to make the leap to believing Sarah's sudden turn towards malicious opportunism as soon as she saw the cash. When questioned about what she would do if she found some hypothetical millions, she insists with chirpy disinterest that she would certainly turn it in. Just one scene of her looking longingly at a brochure for a holiday she couldn't afford would have established some repressed dissatisfation with her life situation, but her general demeanor seemed to suggest not only comfort, but satisfaction.  Why did Hank decide he would burn the money instead of return it if it turned out someone legitimately owned it? Surely it wouldn't be too difficult to anonymously return it without being implicated in it's disappearance. The first murder, after the old guy regained consciousness, why did Hank not try to negotiate with or threaten the old guy to keep quiet about his brother assaulting him? For Hank, finishing the job his brother started didn't seem like an absolute last resort, it seemed like he took the murder lightly.  When Hank got home apparently he volunteered information to his wife about what he'd just done. What? Like he knew she'd be understanding about it or something? Hi honey, I'm home, by the way I just killed a man to protect the money. Wtf? When Jacob shot Lou to protect Hank, why didn't Hank just give the tape back before it got to that point?  The shotgun impact on Lou's wife was cartoonishly ridiculous, sending her flying three feet into the air when the blast didn't even hit her at an upward trajectory.  And the final ridiculous flaw. Jacob taking the fake FBI agent's gun, and instead of just shooting himself before his brother had time to react, he hands it to his brother, and charges him with the responsibility of killing him, setting up the final emotional crescendo of the film. Supposedly the explanation was that it wouldn't look like the fake FBI agent shot Jacob if the shot was fired at point blank range, but why not? Why couldn't forensic investigators at the scene believe an altercation could have transpired where Jacob charged at the gunman from behind when he was about to shoot the sheriff, wrestled with him, and wound up taking a point blank shot to the head? It really makes no sense.  One inspiredly believable moment I will give them film credit for is Hank's difficulty in finding the bullets in the sheriff's office and loading the gun. A lazier writer would have just had him find the gun loaded. If the major plot developments were fleshed out in more detail to be made believable this could have been a great film. As it is, it's a frustratingly flaw-ridden glimpse of what could have been and a waste of time to watch.  
 "The Accidental" by first-time Scottish novelist Ali Smith has to be one of the most irritating books I've read in a very long time.  It's so modern, it's really hard to tell what happened or why you should care about it.  This book won the Whitbread Novel Award.  According to another website, the Whitbread Award lost its sponsor and ceased to exist the same year.  Would it be fair to label this book as the one that killed the Whitbread Award?   The jacket also labels this book as a finalist for the Man Booker Prize whose website says that they award "the very best in contemporary fiction."  For me a requirement of the very best fiction is to be able to affect the reader in a positive way.  My only positive is that I finally got to the end of a dreadful book; & no, it did not get better.  Eve Smart is a novelist.  I usually try to avoid books where writers write about writers.  It's like a movie about movie stars or a song about songwriting -- it seems quintessentially self-indulgent.  Who knows what happens to Eve at the end of the book?  Why is she in some lady's house near the Grand Canyon?  Is it just to present another character as irritatingly self-absorbed as the main character?  Why is Eve unconcerned about her children?  Why does she see her dead mother floating above the Grand Canyon when this wasn't a book about her parents?  Wouldn't it have been more interesting to have her be eaten by a mountain lion?   Michael is Eve's husband.  He's a university professor that sleeps with his students.  His wife Eve knows and doesn't care.  Are they progressive people because they sleep around?  Is this supposed to make us care about them?  What is the effect of their loose behavior on their two children?  Do we care or applaud when Michael gets fired?    Astrid is the youngest child.  She is going through typical adolescent behaviors.  Yes, she is one of the most real of the characters, but she doesn't change throughout the book.  She gets mad at her mother for not being home and refuses to speak to Eve when she calls on the phone.  Astrid was right to be mad at Eve, but so what?  Magnus, the son, was the most interesting character to me simply because he loses his virginity in a church.  It's a bit of a mixed message from author Ali Smith.  What does it say about the church?  Is the message that "The Accidental" is man because there is no God proved because the church is empty?  Who knows?  Amber shows up as the family summers in Suffolk or Norfolk as Eve tries to write.  She buddies up with Astrid smashing her expensive camera.  She has sex with Magnus.  She insults Eve and gives her a knee massage.  She kisses Eve on the lips, right before Eve leaves for the Grand Canyon.  She ignores Michael.  Who is Amber?  Why is she in the book?  Magnus tells Astrid he knows who Amber is after she's disappeared, but Smith fails to let the readers know.  Is this a puzzle?  An illusion?  A nightmare?  Then when the family returns home, their house has been completely stripped.  Who did that?  What's the point?    I did not care for Smith's repetitious use of pages of short sentences.  It doesn't further the story.  It basically just says, "Look at me.  I can write in short sentences."  However, it was enough to have her awarded the Whitbread Novel Award.  I didn't mind the poetry.  I liked it because I could get through the book faster.  To what point it was there, I cannot say.  Perhaps you will be more modern than I and not particularly care if a story makes sense or whether there is anybody about which to care.  For me, this is an award-winning dud.  Taxi!                
 I use the extension cable that came with the adapter to extend the GPS-360 device further down the dashboard. This adapter apparently can't sustain the weight of its own extension cable leaning against the clear plastic cradle. I've only used it twice - first time, it snapped off the back half of the cradle and the second time finished off the front half. The connector sticking out of the adapter still works with the cable, but I'm going to try and super glue the cradle back together before using it again. I don't want the connector to snap off next 
 I bought this to convert some .AVI and .MOV files so I could try video podcasting with a web multimedia class I teach.  I've done this successfully with a shareware product, but thought the resulting video could be a little sharper, so I was willing to pay for and try a commerical product.  (Pinnacle, right?  They do a lot of this stuff, they must know what they're doing . . . . )  HA!!!!  HUGE mistake.  The interface is horrible, and the conversion just-plain-sucks.  Everything came out in flouescent colors with huge blocks covering the screen.  Totally, completely unwatchable.  It looks like a 60s psychedellic experience, like "motion art," not like a proper video at all.  Avoid this product!! 
 my sister got this cd for christmas of '05, and i pray for the day that she stops playing it 24 hrs straight. I thought the music industry was starting to recover from the "boy band" era, until bands like, fall out boy, all american rejects, and the click five came out. Apparently life is ONLY about love to them, they NEVER sing about any other aspect of life. The click five is just another phase in the collapsing of the music industry. At this rate, originality in music, will be a time long lost 
 I have been reading Jodi Picoult's books since I first came across The Pact at the library.  And from there I glommed most of her books reading back to her previous titles such as Songs of the Humpback Whale and then her books, Keeping Faith, Salem Falls, Perfect Match and Plain Truth.  Unfortunately in recent years I haven't been able to get into some of her titles, specifically Vanishing Acts and My Sister's Keeper.  The latter title was just too sad for me to finish.  It was therefore with some trepidation that I picked up the CD of The Tenth Circle while at the library. Because I was told that there was a parallel story told in comice book form, I was concerned that I might be missing something although other readers said I wouldn't be missing much.  But at this point I must add that while the reader did a fine job and I was initially intrigued with the plot and characters, this book dissolved into a listening experience of a book which went off into too many directions to be a good reading experience for me.  I won't review the details of the plot or characters since so many others have done a fine job of this, rather offer, instead my  views just as I finished this title.  I just finished listening to The Tenth Circle and found it was such a grim book.  Not that Jodi Picoult's other books were rollicking fun but this one reminded me of a line from one of her books that said, "There ought to be a moratorium on grief."  Unbelievable the imagination some writers have.  Maybe that's why they're writers and I'm not.  But there were some unanswered questions, coincidence, sheer improbability and then she wrapped up the ending a bit too quickly.  And I might add a bit too happily or hopefully from all that happened for me to consider this a book I enjoyed.  But I do have to add that there was some wonderful writing about what it means to be a parent but I just found it overall very disappointing. I do hope I'm not spoiling this for anybody with such a negative review but I used to love this author's books and wonder if I'll continue to read her which makes me sad. 
 Interesting observations about rehab and kicking a bad drinking problem, so part of the book is worthwhile and inspiring.  About half way through I had to quit.  It was too much like reading the diary of a shallow teenage girl.  (Will he call me?  Did the gorgeous guy wear that tight shirt to impress me?  All I do is think about him.  Is he thinking about me? Oh, please, please, please, let him say something to me.  I love you, but I'm not in love with you.)  On and on. The humor is mildly amusing, but seems forced; it doesn't ring quite true, like the author is trying too hard.  An earlier negative reviewer said they didn't like the author.  It didn't prevent me from reading the book - I like the writing of a number of unlikable people.  But I now understand - the book is completely about this shallow person.  His struggle with alcohol is one of the few interesting/humane things about him.  His colleagues force him into rehab, which turns his life around.  He returns to work a changed and invigorated man, loving life, but continues to mock the people who saved him.  It doesn't dawn on him to thank them.  
 Once again, a juvenile book under the guise of science containing dreadful experiments has been published. But why? The so-called figures are silly pen drawings that add absolutely nothing to understanding what little concepts Wood has presented. But it has such a slick cover and wonderful feeling pages that folks will be hard-pressed to pass it up, especially librarians 
 Paul Auster's City of Glass is perhaps the worst read I've experienced.  The story moves at a pace that would make a snail envious; the murder mystery plot is as thin as air and hardly resolves itself; we spend way too many waking hours with the main character sulking around his apartment staring into a toilet bowl in which he has just defficated--I kid you not.  The best part of this novel is the end.  I read with fervor to get to the end in hopes that the author would have the talent to tie everything together and make this experience somewhat valid; however, I was utterly and discustingly dissapointed beyond my wildest dreams.  To all the reviewers and critics who claim this book is a metaphysical, existential tour de-force, I beg wholeheartedly with my very life to differ.  I believe the author had no such thoughts in mind, had no direction when writing this disgrace of a work and it saddens me to see such an unentertaining, dry-dry-dry piece of fiction with one or two not-so-clever plot devices, gather such literary praise.  Like a Rorschach image you can see life, love, death, a myriad of wonderful symbols, and if you would like to believe that the person who put that ink blot on the page intended you to see all of that depth, intepret and dwell in that depth--coming to conclusions and reflecting ultimately on your own life, well, then, good for you.  But in reality, the person that made that Rorschach for you is Auster, and he just ambigoulsy splatted some ink on the novel pages before you with no ryhme or reason and you All bought it...hook line and sinker. This novel is an exercise in an authors ability to take us nowhere, show us little on the way and still receive praise, despite an ending which is refelctive of the entire work, in that it plain and simply: sucks 
 Worst accessory ever! DON'T BUY IT. It doesn't have power to blow or vacuum a smallest piece of styrofoam or paper. It'just doesn't work, it looks nice, but is utterly loud and gets clogged in a second, I mean if you somehow manage to scratch some dust of your equipment 
 It's simply not the best of Sting '84-'94.  The version of We'll Be Together (a great song) is an alternate take (mix?), VASTLY inferior to the album / radio version.  It's anemic.  Lacks the punch.  In a word -- sucks.  That you're not told this on the cover is misleading.  I really enjoy Mr. Sumner's music.  All the other tunes are as they should be, and they are terrific.  4-5 stars.  But don't buy this product if you expect to hear what you've heard on the album or the radio 
 This is written more for reader's theater than in performance style.  So unless you're very creative and can re-write, I would pass.  This would be good for Sunday School lessons where you can go right to the appropriate verses to follow up.  Not the best for just performance 
 This fakebook is published in C, Bb, and Eb versions. The C version is now on the 3rd edition. But the publisher has not yet sold out of the 2nd editions for the Eb and Bb books, and so have not gotten around to releasing 3rd editions for the other keys. The editions are badly out of sync, in terms of the songs they contain, and sometimes even the key of the song. You can't use these split editions in an ensemble setting, so if you're getting this to play with friends who already have the older edition, avoid this one like the plague.  The low star rating, however, is for the song selection and generally hard-to-read (chords are too small, poor use of whitespace, and songs broken awkwardly across pages) typesetting  that you find in most Hal Leonard fake books. 
 From the reviews I read for this book when it first came out I expected an updated, nostalgic, autumn-golden memoir of young love in Paris.  I was  excited to hear that Dyer is a young up-and-coming British writer.  Throw  in what were described as original sex and trendy drug use and you could  not be faulted for expecting something very good.  Sadly, Paris Trance is  poorly written, boring, pretentiously unfunny.  Why does Alex hold Luke up  as a model?  Why does Dyer so awkwardly go about making Alex to be the  narrator?  Why does the reader not care about any of the characters in the  least?  I can answer this last question: the girls are nothing but pretty,  the boys are nothing but competitive and uncharmingly pop-cultured.  These  are among the most forgettable, interchangeable characters I have read of  since Ellis's "The Rules of Attraction".  Please--I would like  very much to read about sex- and drug-fiend, clever slackers living in  Paris in the 90's; but not if the author is awkward and uninterested in his  character 
 This book has a lot of terms and things that don't make a lot of sense. The intentions in this are great, but I want a book that is straightforward. The exercises aren't bad, but the talk isn't all that motivational 
 book is way too simplistic. good concept, but could have been written in one chapter 
 This is a very uninforming movie.  I'm usually a fan of a good propaganda movie but this is just bad.  There is no relevent information here they simply tell you ideas that you most likely allready had in your head without confirming them with hard evidence.  If you want to watch an actually worth while journalistic film about the bush ties then get Martial Law 911 : rise of the police state.  NOw that is one brilliant peice of wor 
 More ignorant ramblings from someone who hasn't done any research, which is typical of the rabid Christian 
 I finally watched this borefest that I'd recorded from the Scifi channel last spring.  Too bad that I didn't accidentally erase it.  After four hours watching the "full version," I gained nothing and cared less about the characters and who did what to whom.  The only pluses to it were the attention to detail in costumes, props, etc. and the acting which was credible.  The story was preposterous even for a myth.  I cannot believe that anyone over the age of 12 enjoyed this or even consider it worthy of purchase on DVD 
 You can waste your time reading this book, sure. Go ahead. Or, you can pick up Henry Hazlitt's "The Failure of the New Economics: An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies" and watch as an infinitely more talented writer debunks and destroys Keynes and his faulty logic. Not only does he translate the thoroughly unreadable Keynes, he shows the reader multiple instances where Keynes simply contradicts himself, yet keeps right on chuggin' (savings = investments; somehow in his General Theory, Keynes manages to both prove and disprove this). He explains in lucid terms that Keynes "General Theory" isn't "General" at all; in fact, it can only be applied correctly in static situations. In most cases it can't account at all for dynamics. Don't waste your time on this piece of socialist garbage 
 mine blew up the batteries, what a mess. called eton, they said never heard of this happening. took it back for a refund. now i hear a recall is in place 
 I read on this topic with great interest. My family wrestles with drug costs but, at the same time, can attribute being alive and leading productive lives today because of innovative drugs. I have grandparents on medicare, relatives on chronic therapy for everything from high cholesterol to psychological disorders, and others that pay a significant portion of their income to health insurance and/or drugs.  I think the previous reviews of this book sum it up nicely - even those giving it 5 stars seem to agree that the author has an agenda. This is not a thoughtful research style book with provocative insight (is it me or are these books getting harder to find?).  I will not claim to be a policy expert but here are my thoughts.  Americans are capitalists when it comes to everything but their health. It is here that we become socialists. Is that a bad thing? I'm not sure and I grapple with this question myself. When your health is on the line is it fair that people with more means should have access to better healthcare technology? Nobody seems to argue that wealthy people can afford safer cars, live in safer houses and live in safer neighborhoods - that is what success brings right? But when the only cancer drug option costs more than someone can afford it gets sticky. That said - I see a lot of subsidization to help these people both in the government and private sector (charity). When it's your life or your loved one's life on the line it becomes a very personal and understandably complicated issue.  Scientific progress is "community" based and is progressive. A cornerstone of science is that you learn and advance from others - some will turn these innovations to a business that earns a profit and drives further innovation. I agree that pharma/biotech companies don't discover every drug or every drug target but it is they that have the business model to sustain innovation. The profits of this industry, like other industries, drive further innovation that ultimately benefits us.   Drug development is mostly failure. I don't think many people realize this. When I understood how many failures it takes before a drug reaches the market and that the costs of developing drugs keeps going up I can see why drugs costs as much as they do. Simply put - you are not only paying for that new drug you're taking but for the dozens upon dozen of failures that preceded it. The high profit business model is the ONLY WAY to mitigate this risk. Drug companies make huge profit margins but they also invest a greater percentage of their profits back into research and development than any other industry.  Pharma companies have killed their image with all of those "feel good" direct to consumer ads. Shouldn't a doctor prescribe the best drug for each situation based on risk/benefit? And shouldn't these decisions be based on the best facts known at the time and the clinical judgment of the physician? I don't get direct to consumer advertising UNLESS it is purely educational and does not mention or allude to any drug by name. I can understand that when a therapy is available to treat a disease under diagnosed or is emergent that the fastest way to spread the word is through mainstream media.  Even expensive drugs are cheaper than surgery or staying in the hospital (or being institutionalized). It's widely known that for every dollar spent in drug costs you save about 8 dollars in other medical costs.  Bottom line for me is this. I want more innovation. I want my family and friends to get better drugs and avoid the hospital and live better with less pain and suffering. I'm afraid of over regulating the pharma industry simply because I trust the market more than I trust the government. I'm convinced that the pharmaceutical industry has done a hell of lot more to improve human health than it has done to harm it and will continue to do so assuming we don't destroy the business model. Not everyone will be able to afford the latest drugs - but that is where private charity and some government regulation make sense. Don't kill the goose that laid the golden egg because the golden egg is expensive. 
 All I can say is pass me some aspirin. This is a dozy of a bad novel. As it says on the dust jacket, a Supreme Court law clerk grabs a petition and ends up becoming deceased. Its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit. At the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence. Not only does he deal with his family, but his brothers friend, a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for.  And that's only the start of the plot.   Its really pretty bad, it descends into mired pretensions and goofy resolutions. The characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways. Baldacci is along with James Patterson and Dean Koontz one of America's worst authors. If you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this, try one of Harlan Coben's last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character Myron Bolitar in it. Or for a more sophisticated read, look for Denis Lehane, he wrote the amazing Mystic River, but his PI series located in Boston is pretty good as well. 
 I just didn't enjoy this book. I don't mind so much that a book isn't plot driven if the language is beautiful and the ideas stimulating. With this book, however, I didn't even find the language poetic or evocative. And the ideas were so repetitive and expressed so turgidly that I stopped reading half-way through. I really thought this book could do with a whole lot of editing. It was unsubtle, self-indulgent and dull. Perhaps something got lost in the translation? So disappointed. I had been eager to read this book for ages and when it was finally available at the library I was very excited. Oh well 
 I have no problems with how the unit feels and fits into my ear -- it's unobtrusive and light. However, I constantly get complaints from whoever I'm talking to on the phone that my voice is too quiet. I have to speak up louder than normal and cup my hand around the back of the microphone in order to produce an acceptable volume, which kind of defeats the purpose of the headset. The problem seems to be that the boom is too short leaving the microphone too far from and to the side of the mouth 
 Mostly of the pages of the book are API Reference. The first half of the book didn't teach you any J2EE core thing, it just provide basic material such as SQL and HTML etc. I think most of the people already know that when buying book for enterpise system. The other half of the book is just an overview of J2EE. You must not be able to write J2EE applicaton or even understand J2EE after reading the book 
 I actually found the early part of the book dealing with the nuclear weapon okay -- not great like Cussler's books. Just okay. But there appeared to be a major change in style, going from a poor Cussler writing style to completely boring and pathetic. But I also had some sympathy for the American tycoon whose son had been killed by terrorists -- and he was the "bad guy" -- so I lost interest in finishing the book.  
 IN 1998 Clinton said there were weapons of mass destruction. Terrorist are americas greatest threat.  Clinton swept the first bombing OF WTC under the rug...The CIA/intelligence failed the american people numnerous times.  America fights terrorist who  are the true infidels.  They will kill, behead, drag our bodies down streets every chance they can........Americans, many are in total denial of how serious/evil terriorst in  Iraq, Iran, Syria and other countries are.  It is amazing how Americans can have such different views on our greatest enemies.   TERRORIST 
 I loved Ms. Ramsland's book "Cemetary Stories" so I was really looking forward to reading about her foray into the Vampire Culture in search of a "real" Vampire. All she found was a lot of sad lonely individuals of questionable sexual persuasion who engaged in 'Vampiric Costume Drama" for the sole purpose of having a sexual encounter. One gets the feeling that these poor misguided individuals could all benefit from a  great deal of Therapy and/or some Heavy Duty Medication.Even Ms. Ramsland becomes jaded with these poor folk by the end of the book.One gets the feeling that it would be easier to find a 'real" Vampire working the Graveyard Shift at your local 7/11 than in all of the S&M clubs she visited. 
 In her excruciating effort to outlaw the slightest discrimination, Nussbaum neglects the worst discrimination of all: that based on age.  The child in the womb, the disabled infant, the elderly patient threatened by  Kevorkian find no safe harbor here.  And in her pleas for tolerance, the  intolerance toward the religious person, especially the Roman Catholic and  the Muslim, finds no censure.  For all the metaphysical wallpaper, this is  nothing but a tract for the politically correct dowager in Westchester 
  Fans of Anne McCaffrey's Pern series will want to give a pass this attempt by her son to repeat her success. It is a lackluster telling of what could have been an excellent tale. Todd McCaffrey has none of his mother's talent for involving the reader in the tale or character development. The characters lack depth and the story line jumps and jerks rather than gliding from chapter to chapter 
 This wasn't a novel. It was a blueprint. And might as well be considered a history book now. 
 This video is really a disappointment, it came with a Thomas piece so naturally my daughter picked it and I thought the bonus "feature" wouldn't be mixed in with the actually Thomas stories but I was wrong. My daughter easily lost interest when the people would come on and talk about loving Thomas and getting to ride the real Thomas train... I was totally annoyed. 
 Whoever decided this was good for four year-olds must not be a parent of said age group. My four year-old received this as a birthday present. His adult aunt could barely figure it out. It's one of those toys that collapses the moment you play with it, taking all the fun out of the imaginative play that should be occuring. We have all the little parts and bigger pieces in a pile and he just walks around with the bigger piece wondering what to do with it, even though we have the corresponding Mystic Force Power Rangers themselves. I think this toy should be perhaps 1/4 of the price listed. Simply disappointing 
 I usually enjoy James Pattersons' Alex Cross stories. I am not a die-hard fan, but I have always found myself entertained when reading most of the previous novels. But London Bridges hit rock bottom almost from the very beginning.  The story is made from the same formula the past 3-4 Cross-stories has been, and you can almost guess what will happen in the super-short chapters.  First we are inside the mind of one or more of the villains while they commit some gruesome crime, and the plotline is laid out. Then Dr Cross enters the stage, usually semi-depressed over something in his private life, a condition not made any better by the crime he is called in to solve, again usually with a bunch of colleagues, who can be detectives or federal agents, depending on where you are in the series. This time he is upset because of his youngest son, who lives with his mother in Seattle, a long way from Washington DC, where Cross resides with his older kids and his grandmother. Cross is also upset because he has to break up a date with his girlfriend Jamilla, a detective living in San Francisco, in order to get to the scene of this novels 'basic' crime.  This time the villain The Wolf has blown a trailerpark community off the face of the earth, and threatens to do the same to some of the world's major cities, if he is not paid a gazillion dollars and if some political prisoners are not set free. A deadline is given, the clock is ticking and Cross travels from America to Europe and back again and then to Europe and then to USA again within a week or so, in order to catch The Wolf and his fellow thugs, each of the thugs acting out their piece of The Wolf's big puzzle and way to world dominion.  The last 10 pages are utterly confusing, there is no tail nor head, the story seems to be all over the place, and at last you really could not care less if Cross and his whole family will actually survive the ordeals.  This book is not recommend for anyone excpet die hard Patterson/Cross fans. It does not live up to the expectations, but if Patterson can write 5-6 novels a year, then maybe there is an explanation for this book's lacking in quality 
 Mr. Irving has played on misinformation to form a seemingly interesting book that unfortunately continues a tradition of propaganda dating back over 50 years.  His deliberately flawed research relies on known propaganda, both from Nazis still active in the war and later Soviet sources, both with obvious reasons to twist the truth against the Allies.  And he "embellishes" details from the National Archives in Washington, twisting the facts to supply histrionic twists designed to paint Allied (especially American) forces as being the servants of Satan himself!  Irving is a discredit to authors of truth everywhere.  If you want an accurately and painstakingly researched book about the destruction of Dresden that is a fantastic read and depicts the actual truth (including the horrors) with countless interviews of survivors, read "Dresden, Tuesday, February 13, 1945" by Frederick Taylor.  Irving's book should be sent to the trash bin. 
 i am currently subjecting myself to finance curriculum at a quant-heavy, top-5 bschool.  this text was recommended for my Intro Cap Markets class (although the prof didnt exactly use it in the class).  i often used it to gain understanding of what was taught in class.  unfortunately, i found this book to be EXTREMELY painful.  it was verbose, overly complicated, hard to read, poorly organized & full of jargon.  while it is thorough in its coverage of Capital Markets & instruments, i found it to be nearly impossible to read.  esoteric theories & mathematical proofs were introduced with little background, and often without insufficient detail to understand grasp.  but the jargon & vocabulary are what made the book so unreadable ... trying to read a chapter in this book would literally consume 4-5 hours of my time.  AND forget about trying to use this book to do problemsets OR assignments. i could go on, but trust me, this book is bad ... UNLESS you already have a good intro & just want to use this as a reference 
 Very disappointing and BORing! NO likeable characters, VERY uninteresting story.  Could/Would not finish--too many "better" books waiting 
 With all that happens in this book,and much of it is somewhat far-fetched, the only thing that I did not buy were the choices made in the end. They were inconsistent with the character development throughout the book. I felt cheated 
 The sound on this DVD is absolutely horrible.  The dialogue is at a much lower volume than the music and sound effects, making it impossible to view without constantly tinkering.  I also have the VHS, on which the sound is perfect, so I can still watch this wonderful movie.  But I would sure like to get my money back for the DVD 
 interesting story line but shallow and goes nowhere.  kubrick style drawn out and paced shots are unimaginative, poorly composed, and add little or nothing to the experience.  looks like the ending is just a contrivance to exit a lost story line. i've lived in rural japan and it's the most boring place on earth (perhaps the intent here but hardly something you'd pay money to suffer thru or for masochists only), you dont think the younger generations flee to the cities for no reason at all 
 Many people brought this probably thought might has some great MJ play clip but that;s totally wrong u getting a few histoy of his carrerr but 90% is focus at the last game when he;s in bull, that's all, so not worthly unless u die hard MJ fan and ignore review from others ! There;s better one out there 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" puts this novel to shame. It has an interesting premise, but it's so unbelievable (even for fiction!) that I could hardly get through to the end. Gregory is a capable writer, so the descriptions are good, but despite some promising fictional characters (like Hannah), I found the novel dead boring 
 I contacted the author, Sheila Mello, to purchase this title directly from the publisher.  Sheila was very rude and unhelpful.  She hung up on me once.  After contacting her again she told me that it was too much trouble for her to sell me one copy and said to go elsewhere.  Personally, this is very bad business and not a good way to promote your book 
 I bought this for my son's fourth birthday because he's a superhero nut. It's a cute toy except for one critical flaw: it doesn't come anywhere near fitting around the waist of my average-sized 4-year-old (wears a size 4T). I'm talking about three inches of waist gap on even the smallest setting. Yet the belt can be adjusted to a size that would fit a teenager. If you have a 9-year-old who loves running around in a Batman costume, go for it. As for my 4-year-old, he still plays with it sometimes, but we keep it on him with a pair of firefighter's suspenders.  Update: The thick plastic of the belt is now ripped halfway apart. We've only had it two months, and he's hardly played with it for the abovementioned reasons. Not so great for Batman, but perfect for playing Super Chintzy Toy Man 
 Daughter loves the CD but Amazon took one month to deliver. That's unsatisfactory and I would have purchased elsewhere had I known 
 One or two of the essays are interesting; the others are either fuzzy attempts at deep thinking ("We need new paradigms! Bartender! New paradigms all 'round!") or spend too much time touting whatever it is the authors have that they want advertised.  Inconsistent (in both level and quality), but with some buried nugget 
 I read Flags of Our Fathers and enjoyed it more than Flyboys.  Bradley has a writing style that is difficult at times as has personal biases come through very clearly.  As one other reviewer has written, I found it very odd that he often referred to MG Curtis LeMay as "Curtis."  As someone writing about military history, Bradley should have more respect for the uniform and should not call a two star general by his first name like he is talking about one of his golfing buddies.  This was very distracting.  I also found the first couple of chapters of his history lesson very tedious and unfocused - so much so that I nearly quit reading the book.  The latter chapters pick up the pace and are insightful.  Bradley also devotes too much time attempting to demonize the American firebombing tactics.  Thankfully Bradley's bias and negativity toward the Navy and Army is not as pronounced in Flyboys as in FOOF.  This bias is especially odd considering his father was a Navy Corpsman.  
    'A Mighty Wind' seems to be 'This is Spinal Tap' done in a folk medium. Unfortunately, the gags and cliches in this film seem to be lifted, as another reviewer stated, from most of Christopher Guest's previous efforts. To put it mildly, halfway through the film I was half-asleep and wishing a dwarf would crush Stonehenge 
 This tripe was horrible. The only reason i gave it 1 star is because of the bus wreck that was very gory. Besides that, and when the boy scout zombies attack, I fast forwarded thru the entire movie. Even the nudity was horrible. If all other movies on earth are destroyed and TV is abolished, you should STILL not watch this film!!!! 
 The book was poorly written.  There was too much emphasis on tiny characteristics of the characters and not enough focus on Christianity.  It is supposed to be a story about finding God, and if it is, then I missed that point.  The characters have no depth and it is hard to get into, for the plot is too dumb.  I don't like to use childish language, but I can find no other to describe my disappointment.  There was no suspence to the plot, with a very predictable ending.  Please, save your money, borrow it from the library 
 Nothing even close to "say no More" I'm sorry I spent the mone 
 This movie has been done over and over again, with different actors and by different directors, but the plot is stale and has gotten extremely boring.  Don't bother with another cookie cutter movie of this kind.... buy something original or save your money 
 I have to wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewers...to be fair the multiplication information that *is* contained in this book are useful and some of the pictures using the chocolate bar can help students. However, the art references by far overshadow the math lesson and as I was reading it, I found myself distracted and confused...and I'm an adult!  The hershey's fractions book is much better than this one. I thought I'd get the set and now I'm glad I didn't--this one is worth skipping over 
 It is almost impossible to get a clear picture on any channel and the sound quality is poor.  Buying this handheld was a big mistake 
 The good thing is that, except for the spring, the jumper is pretty nice. Unfortunately, the spring is THE most important part and it is not good. It has low elasticity and our baby did not like it as he had to push really hard to get anything exciting out of it. We gave it away for free and will buy a different one for our new baby girl 
 I can see the excitement, people get out of a gorefest but this is too much.  All taboos have been broken there is nothing left.  Johnny Cash should come back and torment the makers of this film for misusing one of Cash's songs. He would never have approved of this film. Letting a newborn baby be come a zombie is beyond bad taste. Johnny's horsemen should trample the makers of this film into grimy puddles of gore 
 Being a graduate student and living in an apartment, I was hoping to find a cheap printer that would allow me to print off course materials and assignments.  It prints off things quite well and it is fast.  It does not, however, print 500 pages per month.  50-100 pages per month is a more reasonable estimate and then the cartridges cost over $20, which is high considering how often you need to buy them.  The item did arrive in a timely fashion and it arrived in the specified condition.  
  People actually gave this movie 5 stars! Are they for real? If you want a good shoot'em up action movie with lots of hip hop and blunt smoking then this movie is for you. It is fun to watch, but to say it is true to life is like saying cabin boy is politicaly thought provoking. It is a fantasy about how rappers wish there life styles really are. Their are so many Scar Face ripoffs it's offencive, and the conclusion is so weak it looks like they said "Okay, we don't have much film left, we gotta' rap this up real quick. DMX, find religion...and cut." Rent the movie, try to figure out what the hell the jamaican guy is saying, ignore the horrible acting of Naz, then return it. And when you review it please don't give it five stars, those are supposed to be for the cream of the crop, not just some "Phat movie you and some down ass playas' watched while moms was outta' da' house. 
 Having read "The Millionaire Next Door," as well as most if not all of the classics in this category, I expected life-altering experiences with this book.  There were too many statistics, and statistics that contradicted one another, not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that, try as I did, I had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop, then because the cover art is great, I decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece.  
 I'm a senior at Oglethorpe University, minoring in English, and I have to say I was disappointed in having this text as my last assignment in our class "The Child in Literature" and as my last English assignment ever.  I found the characters flat and the symbolism overt and unengaging.  At first I thought that the children acted the way I expected them to because they are children.  Children are easily manipulated by their environment.  But as the book progressed, the reader could see each character take the expected turns, and land in the expected outcomes.  Cody needed a father, throughout the entire novel, so obviously he will emulate his father in his adult life.  Jenny is a brilliant girl searching for real companionship, so her end is just as predictable.  And Ezra.  From the monopoly scene in the beginning to defeat in his love life, I never once thought he would veer from that path, and end up any differently than he did.  A book that does not challenge it's readers, and does not invoke any hope in a different outcome, is a very flat and disappointing book.  Even the food symbols, or the name associations, or the exact mirrored images of some of the characters (Luke and his game, or Luke and his recorder, anyone?) are blatently handed out and explained.  I like what Tyler was trying to do, and I can take the characters for what they are, and maybe enjoy them, but as someone who loves to remove the author's intention and just delve into a text, this book upsets me.  Tyler leaves literally no room for interpretation at all.  That might make her a "good" writer, but it certainly doesn't make it a good book.  A book you can't discuss or argue over the meaning of seems pointless.  I can see myself in every one of those characters, but I didn't learn anything from it.  This, to me, seems like light beach reading.  Though the subject is so dark, I don't think I could even recommend it for that. 
 I love Linda Howard books.  I always look forward to her releases and this book was a gross disappointment to say the least.  I think the characters are not developed well, and the relationship between Cal and Cate occurred too fast.  The story was rushed and I'm sure Linda could have done much better writing on this book.  
 WHY  
 I think the story wasnt that great.I didnt think it was very good because it was only about mainiac magee running away and him beating every one in all the sports 
 Unfortunately this is one of those books that I stuggled to get to the end of.  I can just picture Isadora receiving notice that they were going to Cuba and thinking to herself "great! I can write a book and try and profit from it".  My discomfort started when she kept referring to people as an X-----ian, there seemed to be no apparent reason or explanation for this paranoia and it continued throughout the entire book.  By the end of it my cheeks burned with annoyance.  I can only imagine the extent of the damage that she has caused the Cuban tourist industry.  The book seems to be paragraph after paragraph of how appalling things are in Cuba and how little people have.  Again, what was her reasoning for detailing all of this?  And all with apparently such little gusto.  On the whole though, the book is rather dull, switching from one minor detail or rather dull occurrence, to another.  For example, taking the cat to the VET, or the daughter to dance classes.    One aspect of the book does deserve a mention for it's talent.  The ability to write about a dinner with Fidel Castro with such little detail or interest.   I'm a bit worried that Isadora will move somewhere else and write another book about middle class life abroad with her husband 
 I rarely write reviews, but quoting Ebert(who inexplicably liked this!): I HATED THIS MOVIE.   1. Is editor the correct term to apply to Joe Klotz?  I give him credit for making a move under 2 hours feeling like 4.  If you want to see a good slow paced movie watch L'Aaventura.  For a much better recent indie film about family life buy the Squid and the Wale.   2. If the director hoped to elicit the sterotypical slow pace of southern life he succeeded too well. Amy Adams earned acclaim for playing yet another dumb, but sweet southerner (see Forrest Gump, Waterboy).  I guess her performance reaffirmed what Hollywood thinks of the south.  Notice all the glowing reviews come from people either from California or NY.  Does the intelligent southerner exist in the minds of studio execs?   3. I assume that people like this movie because of some form of self deception or masochism.  I feel bad for the masochists, but not the pretentious pseudo-intellectuals who can conjure meaning from a film devoid of a plot or artistic merit.   4. RENT THIS FIRST and be thankful you will only lose 2 hours of your life not $19.9 
 I was expecting a book about concrete homes.  The book showed little on concrete other than the introduction.  I wish I could of viewed first or at least return it 
 Ryan Reynolds plays a smarmy, crowd pleasing new teacher who immediately bonds with all the angelic waifs in this fairytale of a school. He wins them over by being their buddy, finds the time (and money) to kit himself out as an indian chief, and even re-inacts a civil war in the playground (complete with black powder rifles). His destiny is clear from the moment he blurts out, "How much time do we have? Not much...". David Paymer is the comic relief, all that's missing is the floppy shoes and clown makeup. There is also the usual puppy love sub-plot with the not so awful young actor Andrew Robb, just a shame that the plot has nowhere to go.  The entire film reeks of trite, moralistic falseness. If this were just a comedy then it wouldn't matter how silly it was (accounting for your tastes), but it tries to aim too high and preach to us the meaning of life. I'm guessing this was targeted at younger audiences by the studio, but give the kids some credit, they can spot a stinker a mile away. We just need more people to be bothered leaving honest reviews (not just the fans) to lower the feedback to a realistic score, so people don't get suckered into buying such drivel.  If you want truly decent teacher/student heartwarming stories (without the shmaltz), try "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" (the remake is good too), or "Mr Holland's Opus". For some good escapist fun I'd also recommend "School of Rock" 
 First off I must admit that I do not own this book, or any book in the series. These comments are not so much aimed at this specific text as they are general. To be fair I did seek out some online excerpts to see if this book was different from what was expected.  To be brief, reading the Zohar in English is like listening to Beethoven's 9th Symphony on a $10 clock radio. If you understand the significance of every letter and shape of the letter which is part of the text, you realize how poor a translation would be. While I applaud the goal of making Kabbalah more accessable to people I think the effort would be better spent with a great guide to Aramaic, maybe even a study course in Aramaic, so people who are seriously interested can gain proficiency and read the original text. If you are not willing to gain the proficiency in Aramaic there is no point in studying the Zohar - you will not derive the proper meaning from the text (meaning connotations and other references).  For those who laud the authorship of this book I question the veracity of their statements. Zohar is not fast food. You cannot take a shortcut to understanding the text by reading a translation. In the excerpt I read in English I could not follow what was going on or being said. There were just a bunch of words devoid of meaning. While I am reasonably proficient in the original text (Aramaic) I got nothing from the excerpt and I am also a native English speaker.  I can see this being used maybe as an aid for those who are trying to study the Zohar in Aramaic and periodically need to translate words they are not familiar with. But again, there are so many translations in Hebrew that will more closely match the Aramaic, that I think the English would still fall short in trying to understand concepts.  For those who mention injecting one's Kabbalah into the Zohar I seriously question their credentials. The idea of a translator slanting the text is preposterous. Firstly, this just lays credence to the point that this text should not be translated. Secondly, you are supposed to personalize the text and interpret it as you see it for yourself. There is no serious interpretation of the text that can be ignored or left out when trying to understand things that are considered neither logical nor physical. Thirdly, the idea that there is a more scholarly translation or a less scholarly translation is silly. There is a more brief or a more extensive translation, there is a more broad or a more literal translation. In the end you are still stuck with a translation. Readers may not like to hear it, but a lot will be lost in translation. There is also certain background that is needed as there are many references to other Hebrew texts in the Zohar proper 
 Worst book I've ever seen!  Like has Swain ever been to the are 
 The typesetting makes this book unpleasant to read. However, it is the writing style that makes the reading a frustrating experience: The author throws you piles of technical terms without clearly explaining their meaning, or the relation to and difference from related acronyms. It might be a book for you only if you are already a telecom expert. Otherwise, you would probably find yourself in a similar situation to mine--hoping someone can help you with tons of questions you cannot find answers for from this book 
 I was really impressed with the professional reviews Indecision received.  They must have been written by friends of the author, because this is, quite simply, a bad book.  Witticisms are sprinkled throughout, but nearly always feel preplanned, and stand out from a silly plot and premise.  If you find my review lacking, it is because reading Indecision has made me dumber 
 One word: boring. This book took 40 pages just to describe people dying everywhere and that the remaining survivors ended up in a hall together. After that, no zombie-killing action for the next 100 pages or so. All of it went something like this: "We were all scared. We didn't know what to do. Michael showed signs of irritation at the group's indecisiveness. How could dead bodies move? Some of us wanted to leave, others wanted to stay here. The whole world was coming to an end." Way too much imagery about their surroundings and emotions but not enough horror element to warrant this as a horror novel. Makes a good read for people who just want to throw away their time at amateur work that offers nothing particularly interesting. The spotlight review written by "citymars" is yet another testimony to the points I'm trying to make.   If you really like this or want to see for yourself what I meant, you can download a free ebook version at David Moody's website. Other titles that ARE actually worth reading are: "The Rising" by Brian Keene and "The Walking Dead" series by Robert Kirkman. 
 The wifi is a great idea!  The idea on paper sounds amazing, but the way you had to do it was horrible.  it gave you no control over what pictures or anything.  plus it was slow.  The Picture quality was HORRILBE!!!  M y two Megapixel cell phone takes better pictures than this camera.  They look AMAZING on the LCD screen, but once you get them on the computer, they are fuzzy, grainy, etc.  I would not recomend this camera to anybody.  yes, it has some nice features, but the pictures are anything but acceptable 
 If you like recipes that don't work, sauces that don't thicken, then this is the book for you.  It's a collection of poorly written recipes that I would recommend you don't waste your money on.  If you're serious about Asian cooking, don't waste your time or money with this book 
 Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him 
 Note that this product includes only the AC adapter but no additonal cabling to attach to the Zune.  So if you were thinking about having one cable to hook to your PC and another to charge if you are away from you PC, remember to take the Zune cable with you. For $29.95 I expected them to include the 25 cent cable 
 My question throughout the book was "Why?".  This was not a story that screamed to be written.  There was no uplifting message or eye-opening resolve.  I can't understand why a talented writer would waste her valuable time writing it or why I wasted my time reading it.    The characters aren't sympathetic or real enough, the story manages to be syrupy and tawdry all at the same time, and the ending wasn't an ending - just more of same.  It's not a bad book - it's just not a good one 
 The fabric, texture and color were extremely cheap quality.  It looked faded and unattractive I had to return it for a refund. Don't bother if you like good quality and nice clothes. 
 I received the watch and it is definitely a great looking watch.  Unfortunately the crown wouldn't pull out (to set the date/time) so I returned it immediately.  Fortunately, Amazon's return policy is very easy and convenient with no charge for shipping (either way) for broken items.  I'll probably try again with another Invicta from Amazon 
 I was optimistic for Greg Kinnear once.  He was very funny ragging on Soap Soup.  He usually plays the nice-guy second banana in film or a man dying of AIDS.  Auto Focus gave him a chance to portray a 1960's TV icon, Hogan, in Hogan's Heroes.  The replication of the original cast is a bit eerie.  After all, these actors dress up as German prison guards.  A chill goes down my spine, but Hogan's was a comedy, which made the series kind of a curiosity beyond the silly caricatures of those funny SS guys.  Anyhow, Bob Crane played Hogan for six years and Kinnear badly imitated.  Yes, I'm sorry to say, Kinnear is awful as Crane, which puts a damper on the bio-flick.  Here's a disc jockey with semi-hip 60's patter on the air with an All American family, a loving wife and cute kids.  They live like Ozzie and Harriet in the LA burbs, going to Catholic Church on Sunday.  Crane lands his big break, falling for the trappings of fame.  Most people fall for the trappings of fame.  Read the supermarket check out magazine racks.  So all of a sudden, Crane's garage porn collection isn't enough.  Women, very beautiful, Hollywood loose-morals women find Crane and his buddy William Defoe irresistible.  The birth of the video camera comes into play.  The trouble with the script or maybe it's the cardboard way Kinnear acts, we watch, but in the end, we don't care. 
 You know what you're getting with a movie like this.  Its not going to be Oscar material but you'll have a few scatalogical jokes and see some T&A, a decent time waster.  The problem is that this movie is NOT FUNNY and has very little T&A,  even in the unrated version.  I don't mind lowbrow movies.  Loved the first VanWilder, loved EuroTrip,loved Harold & Kumar, I even enjoyed American Pie: The Naked Mile, but I honestly did not laugh once at this movie.  Not once.  
 It's very good, and I only give it one star because my teacher ruined it for me.  She analyzed everything Arthur Miller wrote in it, whether the lights were to be dark, or bright, how he shift time, how the instruments played, believing symbols of all of them.  Contrary to Arthur Millers own statements which I printed out and gave to the class, that he didn't plan on anything, he just wrote.  Let people do with it what they do.  In that affect, the teacher took a great play, and ruined it with her ideas of what he meant.  
 As a child I remember finding this magazine at my doctor's office and reading it because it was the only thing available. It has not changed much. There are no redeeming features to make up for the dated and patronizing content. This Magazine will neither stretch your child's mind nor keep him entertained. It only teaches the child what he already knows and feeds him what he has already seen. In the coming era of global connection, children must become aware of other parts of the world and lifestyles alien to them. Only telling them what is already common in their everyday lives helps to foster racism and xenophobia 
 Don't buy this edition. Get the first edition, put together by the original editors, G.S. Kirk and J.E. Raven (ISBN 0521091691), which is readily available through Amazon. The current edition has been hopelessly corrupted by M. Schofield, who has edited out crucial fragments in order to support his own "Analytical Philosophy" take on the Presocratics. As an example, he has removed crucial fragments which link Parmenides with the Pythagoreans.   So make sure you acquire the 1st Edition of this crucial sourcebook which was edited in an honest fashion by G.S. Kirk and J.E. Raven, and ignore any later edition which has been corrupted and invalidated by M. Schofield.  Also, take a look at Peter Kingsley's trilogy of books on Parmenides and Empedocles: "Reality," "In the Dark Places of Wisdom," and "Ancient Philosophy, Mystery, and Magic: Empedocles and Pythagorean Tradition." These books will give you the real fragments, and provide you with a real take on why scholars with the intellectual dishonesty of an M. Schofield will rewrite and even abandon the original texts in order to further their own misguided agendas. 
 I have been teaching my daughter French since she was born. I speak French fluently, but my accent is far from perfect, so when I learned about this CD I was delighted: this was (or so I thought) exactly what I needed to make up for my not-so-great pronunciation. Was I dissappointed!! The accent in the CD is worse than mine!    
 This story takes place in 1985 at Zito`s house. Quint was his best friend. He always ate breakfast over there. He always carried a marble with him and they go to school and when they come home he had to eat dinner over Zito`s house. So they go and have fun eating stuff.  This story is mostly about two boys that always make jokes all the time about scrambled eggs. And is a story about food all they eat. Then Zito lost his marble and he said that Quint stole his marble but Quint did not take it. He told the teacher that Quint stole the marble that he liked so they started to yell at each other. Then school was out so they went home then Zito said he was very sorry. He said that he left the marble at his house so they became friends again  In my opinion this story was not that bad it was kind of  boring but it was good  not awesome but who cares about marbles and eggs 
 	              The Worst Book In The Universe!!!     The Last Book in the Universe is a completely predictable book that will easily bore you.  The first half of the book is complete snooze, and even though the second half gets a little bit more interesting, it's nothing to get excited about.  The story is about a kid that lives in a rundown Earth, who tries to save his dying sister by breaking the rules.  Absolutely nothing in Universe will surprise you in the plot, because you've heard the story before.  This story has absolutely no emotion.  The characters will cry, but you wont care.  The characters will yell and scream, but you'll be asleep.  If you are a person who has trouble sleeping, I'd recommend this book `cause this book works better than Ambien.  The only good aspect of this book is it is mildly entertaining.  Not on purpose, but Universe's narration of this book is so pain wrenchingly horrible that you'll break out in fits of laughter.  I think I've run out of snide comments to say except for this; buying this book would be a great prank gift,or way to waste some one else's money.  This book is a complete waste of time, money and paper.    			Brian 
 If you like nude guys wrestling each other for 1 whole hour then this is your movie there is no after  scene like in a hot steamy shower. Just nude guys wrestling I thought it was boring 
 Enough said.  An utter waste of time and money. This book flows like a bloody glacier. The author barely presents an argument or any direction. Only to be read if you enjoy arbitrary & poorly presented facts of history and grammar to be compared with that of a high school student. I'd rather read The DaVinci Code again, and that's saying something 
 Julia Roberts plays Ed Harris' young new wife. Susan Sarandon plays Harris' ex-wife. Ex-wife does not like new wife. New wife does not like ex-wife. Ex-wife's cutsey, but bratty kids make new wife's life a living hell. Ex-wife thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo. New wife thinks ex-wife is a nagging battle axe. New wife and ex-wife fight and yell at each other ad nauseum. How does the film solve this conflict? Ex-wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer -- everyone reconciles, ex-wife and new wife suddenly love each other, the end. This is one of the most cliched, saccharine, hackneyed and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by Hollywood in the past decade. If you like Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon or Ed Harris, please see Erin Brokovich, Dead Man Walking and The Right Stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe 
 This Schaums Outline-type manual apparently had been issued with an earlier text of McClellan's. It is made up of lecture-type problems too brief to understand without a closely keyed text. I'm returning the book.  Hope you don't get fooled 
 To anyone who has or is planning on reading this book, consider this. This book has a lot of words which feel good and can make anyone's guilty conscience ease in thinking that "your own will is god's own will." (quoted from Walsh's books) If you will it, then God wills it because he loves you and wants you to live in freedom, right? Will is a precursor to action. If there is no such this an a 'right' or 'wrong' will, then in essence there is really no such thing as a 'right' or 'wrong' action. If someone else's actions hurt you, you feel that action is wrong. But the person who hurt you certainly had his feelings for acting that way, right? It was his will, therefore he was justified and right and god's right there to back him up. The victim is suffering. Where is his god when he needs him? Was the victim correct in believing the action wrong? Was the perpetrator correct in believing his action was right? In this book, god says that WE have the authority to decide what is right or wrong. The action is both right and wrong, right? Wrong.  This is when you may want to take a look at the Bible. The Bible portrays God as a loving yet HOLY God. Holy is defined as exalted or worthy of complete devotion as one perfect in goodness and righteousness. He loves us but sees a REAL AND DISTINCT right and wrong as clear as day where sometimes it appears to be a tangled mass to our limited senses. He created us and gave us a conscience which can in most cases discern a right and wrong in a situation. He gave us a free will which allows us to then choose that right or wrong. Are we always going to do the right thing? No, and He knows that. When we do wrong thing, it is unhealthy at best to believe that doing wrong is the right thing to do because we desire it. We're NOT God. We do wrong all the time and God simply wants us to acknowledge this. He wants us to exercise our FREEWILL to do right according to our conscience and what's told in His book. But he knows that even still we will do wrong when attempting in good faith to do right. And that is why in a generous act of sacrificing Love He sent His Son Jesus Christ to SHOW us the way, sacrifice Himself on the cross for our wrongs, and be there still today to forgive our wrongs when we believe in Him and in the truly amazing thing He did for us. It's a beautiful thing!  I urge you to believe that the Holy Bible is not a lie and Jesus Christ simply did the things the book said He did and is the person He claimed to be. 11 disciples took everything they said and wrote to their grave and never recanted even after much persecution. Wow!  I've been a believer in Christ for almost seven years and He's continued to worked wonders in my life. I would have been a fan of these books if God had not put me on His path.  In case you're wondering, I gave this book 2 stars because it has reinforced my faith in Christ by giving a glaring example of what God is not.  If you've read through all of this, thank you. I encourage you to write me. God bless!  
 We purchased two of these multifunction machines for two separate offices.  While the brother has many capabilities, including SCAN-to-Email, file and PDF.  Quality problems greatly hender its performance.  Scanning documents through the document feeder result in crooked/offset images.  I thought we simply purchased a bad-unit.  But, after returning it for a replacement - we got the same result.  The first unit we purchased broken down after about 2 months.  It just started making this really loud clunking sound.  Then it just complained with error messages and wouldn't print.  There was a problem with the included software, which caused Scans to fail with error code.  The only way to get a fix for this problem is to call technical support.  There is no information on the error on their web site.  I love the feature set of this product - but the quality is poor 
 I bought "Words That Sell" and the companion book " Phrases That Sell" based on a recommendation from a new letter published by D H Communications. Both of these books were a major disappointment. These words may work on the dumbed-down consumer market lemmings with an affinity for the Pacific coast, but they are not effective for technical marketing literature aimed at an educated clientele. I would change the titles to "If you find any of these phrases or word in your copy, rewrite it." I stop listening and dismiss the possibility of truth or relevancy of the message when these words are present 
 Sentimental and uninteresting.  Ethan Canin seems to think that the same kind of character is interesting over and over.  And I hear this book was a best seller--no wonder nobody reads good books anymore when this is offered as great literary fiction 
 what were they trying to teach me?   this book is intermittently funny, more often highly and dryly pretentious and snobbish, but more than anytyhing I find it very very creepy. Towards the end when things start to fall apart for Aimee, Dennis/Waugh achieves a combination of callousness and feeble wit that is so offputting to the sensitive reader, I can hardly believe the book made it to press without a major rewrite of the last few chapters. It would be one thing if it were much much funnier, but most of the "comedy" is of the "lost in translation" variety: nothing but xenophobia and looking down on those beings from a different culture and therefore certainly inferior that populate certain parts of the globe. haha those silly japanese persist in speaking their own language/americans women are all completely interchangable unlike our English roses! Didn't this guy also write "Brokeback Revisited" anyway?  I was totally embarrrased to be seen reading it in public when I took it to dinner with me one night at the little thai place!  the movie is interesting cause john waters certainly got the idea of edie the egg lady from this film (and not from the book. mom is quite different onscreen as conceived by terry southern and c. isherwood.( also liberace is fun, rod steiger is A M A Z I N G.                            
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 Wendy Doniger, the "translator," of Manu calls the book "evil". Well, you won't confuse her as a cultural or moral relativist. She is quite happy to call attention to 'backwards' India from her Judeo-Christian ivory tower. Only buy this "translation" is you would also consider being taught Torah by an anti-semite. 
  There are about 20% power thoughts in this CD/Book and rest are unpractical nonsense.  Nonsense like:  "I love every cell of my body" "Let the universe's solution come to you" "I am decisive in my decisions.  If I make a poor one, I'll just make another one."  I guess if you are completely foolish or just ignorant, this book will not help you much.  Your mother probably gave you much more and better advise than this book.  
 Blue Note is to be chastised for this horrible transfer of this classic cd. Listen to tracks 1 and 3 for an example of what I'm talking about. Compared to Wayne Shorters sax solos, Lee Morgan's blistering trumpet solos sound as if they're being played at the far end of some distant wind tunnel. Did Blue Note not notice this discrepency??  This cd is in dire need of a remastered version. Blue Note has ripped us off and owes it to their paying public. Either that or give me back the 15 bucks I paid 
 This "mini-booklet" is basically a reiteration of the stages of grief set within a Judeo-Christian perspective.  One could probably stop by the local funeral parlor and pick up a free pamphlet that would be every bit as edifying.   Good grief, what a disappointment! 
 I'll put my opinion first, so there won't be any doubt in your mind.  I don't believe that you can write useful books about national character.  Is there really such a thing as "national character"? People are  just too different, too unpredictable. How well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you ?  How well can you predict what  people in your own country will do ?  Would every Italian, if they could  write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ?  I seriously doubt  it.  So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man's views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million Italians.  After reading it, I felt even more strongly  that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time.  An  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?   Anthropologists have  been concerned, for many years, in getting the "inside view"--the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it.  While Barzini is  indisputable Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign  visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why  they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think.   This is not a successful gambit.  Cultures are based on many general  factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family,  etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific.  Barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the  state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily  and the Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy's long domination by  foreigners.  But nothing really connects.  There are only superficial,  scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp.  The reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes.  Barzini is at his best when describing the  lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history.   These sections were well-written and interesting.  But his portrayal of  Italian "character" is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately,  unconvincing.  Finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to  this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page.  Myself, I  got pretty tired of those lists.  If you want to know something useful  about Italy, read another book.  If you just want entertainment, which  might support any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could  be for you 
 At least Tim McGraw tried to be creative and do something a little different.  But it was still feeble.  He has an "okay" voice.  HE CAN'T WRITE & CAN'T PLAY! That's all it takes for me to discredit him as nothing more than a shallow Nashville Pop Star.  His cover of 'Tiny Dancer' is pretty pathetic.  No self respecting Texan would buy any of his work.  He is a pretty face marketed to the mindless masses, & young girls who know nothing about music.  No different than Britney Spears, or any other pop stars that will be all but forgoten 10 years from now.  No musical significance, except the significant headache received from listening.     
 while i was watching this movie i thought to myself, "am i going to die?  have i gone to horrible movie hell?"  you see i was trapped in a theater.  it's like being tortured by some horrible nightmare but you can't leave cause B actors are pretending they can act just because they're fat.  the in crowd gives you that feeling like when it's grossly bright outside and it's a sunday afternoon and you're in a car and you've been sitting for 6 hours and you feel sweaty and there'a a football game playing on the am radio and you want to escape.  in conclusion, this movie turns me into melting snow.  but i suppose there are worse movies-- (see my review on gummo) 
 Nice, concise book about making things happen for you the way you want them to. Her point is that if you treat yourself well, you and others will treat you as a quality person and you will be happy. However, many of her "solutions" are totally unrealistic for the average person - she has secretaries, lawn guy, babysitters, grocery delivery service, and lots and lots of money to make her life the way she wants it - not too many people have the kind of cash that you'd need to run your life this way. And her insistence on buying quality at any cost is a bit extreme - buying a $500 purse or a $1000 coat so you never have to buy them again does not appeal to me. I like buying a new purse or coat every now and then. She also make the ludicrous suggestion that you if you can't control your impulse buying, get out a $100 bill, spend it all, and then dump your purchases in the Goodwill bin on your way home. Now that's just absurd. Its a good book to get you thinking about you can change your life, but you'll only get so far with this book unless you happen to have a lot of disposable income and the ability to just move any time you feel like it. 
 The author treats the media as if it is the devil. as if all tv, computers, etc are bad. This book wil surely destroy some child's lif 
 I have no doubt about the author's sincerity in offering this personal interpretation of Musashi's original work, "Book of 5 Spheres" (or "The Book of 5 Rings"). The problem I have with what Stephen F. Kaufman has done to Musashi's book deals more with his implied suggestion that this edition is the result of an actual ~translation~ which he was responsible for (see pages xi-xii, "Translator's Note"). In fact, when asked Mr. Kaufman has admitted that this volume (and some others he has written) are not translations at all, but rather his own personal interpretations of English translations done by other authors--something he DOESN'T bother to communicate to his readers. The title of this volume, at odds with the "translator's note" on pgs xi -xii, is actually "...The Definitive _Interpretation_ of Miyamoto Musashi's Classic Book of Strategy". I fail to understand why Kaufman confuses his readers by mixing and matching interpretation with translation. It should be noted that Mr Kaufman himself does NOT speak or read Japanese, and in fact innocently named his own martial arts school "Dojo no Hebi" ("Place of Practice's Snake"), when he was trying for "Dojo of the Snake" (which in Japanese would have been "Hebi no Dojo", meaning "The Snake's Place of Practice"). Innocent mistakes yes, but one would expect a Black belt of the 10th Dan (degree grade) and a proclaimed "Hanshi" (master practitioner) to at least check his spelling with someone who _could_ speak the language he was using.  Kaufman doesn't bother to provide a bibliography of which English translations he used, nor does he include notes explaining _how_ he drew his conclusions from the texts he studied. I am bothered by the fact that many of Musashi's words have been heavily edited, re-arranged, or deleted altogether by this author until they have been removed entirely from their original context. In doing this, Mr. Kaufman has actually ALTERED the _meaning_ of Musashi's work! What remains appears to be little more than a new age self-help guide for modern martial artists which has retained a smidgeon of flavor from Musashi's original work.   A brief example illustrating Kaufman's tendancy to put his own words in Musashi's mouth is in the fourth paragraph on page 6 of Kaufman's book. Kaufman reworks Musashi's words regarding Merchants as a class to read, "Merchants are a ridiculed class because they produce nothing except profit from the work of others." Two other men who have actually translated Musashi's work from the original Japanese suggest nothing sinister in Musashi's original work. Victor Harris in his translation of "A Book of Five Rings" offers: "The way of the merchant is always to live by taking profit" (page 41, 1974). Translator Thomas Cleary offers the same sentence as: "Whatever the business, merchants make a living from the profits they earn acording to their particular status" (page 7, 1993). This is a minor demonstration of the differences between Kaufman's work and those offered by actual translators--the translators make an effort to convey to the reader the actual meaning of Musashi's words in English, while Kaufman crafts a new meaning which never existed in Musashi's original work. Suffice to say, Kaufman's interpretation seems heavily influenced by his modern view of martial arts and his concept of what he feels samurai may have been like four centuries ago. It bears little resemblance to competent translations of Musashi's writings.   I recommend two excellent translations of Musashi's work which stay true to the original Japanese. The first is "A Book of Five Rings" translated by Victor Harris, a mechanical engineer and technical interpreter of Japanese language who not only practiced kendo (Japanese fencing), but studied this art in Japan for 3 years under Ito Kyoitsu at the Seijudo Dojo. A second recommendation is "The Book of Five Rings" by Thomas Cleary, another professional translator. Unlike Kaufman, I did not find translations by these men to be "intellectual exercises in translating Japanese to English" (pg xi). I found legitimate translations by competent translators who were clear and direct...I suspect most scholarly people, whether students of martial arts or not, will draw a similar conclusions upon comparing Kaufman's book to any actual translation.  
 What I as a student found lacking in this book: 1.) It has many problems, which is a good thing, but this fact is negated by its lack of a publically available solutions manual and numerous and obvious misprints. 2.) Many of the examples gloss over important points to note and I found many vague and cursory.  The instructor I had used more detailed material from other textbooks.  Many examples also appeared to be used as a substitute for generalized text explainations and diagrams.  It also seemed rather vague on the more theroetical aspects of the material.  Considering all the other Statics textbooks out there, chances would favor some of them being a lot better than this one.  And taking into account the price, I would consider this book a total waste of resources.  If you're a mechanical engineering or aerospace student, you'll probably need a better introduction than this if you hope to survive the more advanced courses 
 Disappointed. As an English teacher, I expected a more compelling and less hokey use of Whitman.  The first story, of the deformed Whitman loving boy, was utterly unbelievable and the continuity was incredibly challenging 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 If you are searching for a resource to help you generate practical ideas to stimulate creativity and innovation in your organization, look elsewhere.  The author is at his best when describing the culture and history of ancient Athens, Renaissance Florence or even the 20th centry Bauhaus.  In fact, if you are looking to stimulate your own thoughts by researching these historical periods or locations, you might be better served to read historical works with more depth and then draw your own conclusions to apply to the place where you work.  In the end, this type of work represents the worst in "business research."  The CHAI-T process described is a pseudoscientifical worm submerged in tequila-like snakeoil.  The plotting of points on graphs and the creation of various geometric shapes smacks of another ancient practice ... smashing a vase on a table and having an expert come over interpret the remaining shards.    If you are looking for a more digestible and applicable resource, that offers no scientific delusion, read Tom Kelley's "The Art of Innovation" or even Seth Godin's "Purple Cow."  You'll invest less time and come away with some practical ideas for your team or corporate culture 
 I was a huge Prince fan when this movie came out and I remember how excited I was about it! So I took my girlfriend to it and was embarrassed for Prince and myself for dragging my girlfriend there. It was painfully unfunny, convoluted, poorly directed with terrible sets...ugh it's a terrible mess and doesn't deserve to be preserved 
 This is a book that accepts the final outcome being that divorce is OK if you have tried certain steps.  Too many stories that support divorce are enclosed.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants a marriage to work.  This book should be called "Reasons Why I Should Go".. 
 yeah, ok, Ice Cube is a bounty hunter and Mike Epps is a criminal who ends up teaming up with him to defeat the badguys,am I right on that...right. the story is great but not that great. so many holes and so many stupid supporting characters doesnt make up for the seemingly endless movie with a taste in your mouth that sits there and then makes your mouth all icky, thats what it was like for me folks. god I almost fell asleep at that photo shootout and then the other one where at the end with the boat and superlame climax. put some thought into your head as you are about to watch this. for Cube and Epps and Eva Mendes fans only. and if you wanna see an old lady in a raincoat like coat with a thong bikini on it, then this is the film for you 
 Robert Kiyosaki's books are all the same thing re-packaged over and over again. This book could have been condensed into a couple of paragraphs and saved it's readers a lot of time. He writes in an arrogant, condescending manner that is hard to stomach. I would hate to have been his real dad. It's obvious that he despises him and worships at the alter of "Rich Dad." It's offensive and disturbing. Read the first review of this book and you'll have the essence of the whole thing. Don't give this guy any more money for putting out this drivel 
 Do not expect this book to shed any light on the culture and people of Hong Kong...  I bought this book because the stories were set in my hometown, despite the fact that I usually do not like short stories. I was quite disappointed mostly because the Chinese people depicted in those stories seem more alien to me than anything else. They were definitely not the everyday Hong Kong people one would meet. I felt that the the writer was still trying to portray Hong Kong as a mysterious place when it is definitely not.   The writing is not bad, but the contents and plots left much to be desired 
 The book starts out reasonably well enough, with Davidson drawing you into the overview of the life of Carl Sagan's parents.  But as the book progresses, you begin to see another side to the story of Sagan's life that you weren't expecting.  Davidson doesn't hesitate to make broad generalizations and interpretations of his interviews with people in Sagan's life, even making borderline psychoanalytical conclusions to explain his behavior when Davidson is clearly not qualified in this area.  There were several points where I read a line and found myself just staring at the book with a gaping jaw and a sense of incredulility, wondering how he could make such a strange conclusion.  For example, when he discussed Sagan's novel Contact, it quickly became apparant that Davidson hadn't even read the book or he wouldn't be making such strange interpretations of the book's plot.  Additionally, Davidson's writing is incredibly simplistic; although it may appear vivid and engaging on the surface, it is full of groan-inducing cliches and overdramatized descriptions of events.  This, in combination with his purely speculative conclusions on Sagan's personality, made me want to vomit.  Overall, although I was able to glimpse a small part of what made Carl Sagan so special and see a somewhat decent overview of the events in his life, I feel I was getting a blurry and distorted picture of who the man really was 
 all i've got to say is that if you liked the ransom ep, you probably won't like chroma. cartel basically traded in their high energy pop-punk style for a shot at the mainstream, which is pretty shameful. i mean, there's even a piano ballad here, and not a good, heart on sleeve tearjeaker either, but a boring, pop radio one. cartel's chroma is the very definition of what it means to sell-out. 
 The cords provided for the hook-ups are way too long....especially when you are riding a motorcycle....I could wrap them around me twice and still have cord left. It would be very easy to get caught up in these when turning a corner.  We returned the item.. 
 I'm a big country fan, but it really gets to me when artists 'pontificate' their left OR right leaning political views. Stick to the music guys, and leave the politics to those who are more informed. It's funny how they grab on to the stereotypes perpetuated by the liberal left and just regurgitate it without fact checking at all. Reagan was probably one of our greatest presidents ever, and the left really, really hate that.  The songs aren't bad, but I prefer "the seer" or "the crossing". Check out those instead of this release. Unless you happen to BE a leftist and want to listen to something that further validates your views 
 Before our family trip for 10 days throughout Germany, I purchased a few different travel guides.  After having each of them in hand before leaving home, we didn't even put this one in our luggage.  I reccommend Daytrips Germany, 6th Edition 1st and then Rick Steves' Germany and Austria 2006.   Those 2 books were great for finding tourist sites, great restaurants and hotels that could accomodate 2  adults and 2 kids (most hotels don't have rooms with 2 beds! 
 I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the  "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
 This cd its just horrible, they sold only 10,000 copies enough to pay for their instruments lol ! There are better bands than this an example is bleeding through so i think no one cares about a re release peace out 
 This book is composed by Prof. David Rutledge.  His class required the book, which is the sole reason for the book entering my hands.  This book, and the related course EE20 were the bane of my existence.  The book is useless at explaining the basics of electronics.  The book solely serves as a cookbook for the construction of a NORCAL radio.  It fails at teaching important conecepts, and could only be used by the most faint-hearted hobbyist.  On a related note, I have a spare book if anyones interested in buying one.  As for now, it just holds up one end of my dorm room bed 
 If you're an amateur historian that prefers a logical sequential order to your reading, then don't buy this one.  It's more like a scrapbook, or collage than a step-by-step history.  I suppose if you've already done a little reading on this subject, and you simply want a reference book to put on your shelf, then this may be the buy.  Otherwise, there's got to be some much better choices 
 Having read "The Millionaire Next Door," as well as most if not all of the classics in this category, I expected life-altering experiences with this book.  There were too many statistics, and statistics that contradicted one another, not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that, try as I did, I had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop, then because the cover art is great, I decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece.  
 It would at least meant that I cared one way or another what was happening when reading it 
 After reading Richard Matheson's "What Dreams May Come" I must say that I'm glad his push for the afterlife is not based upon reality.  Yes, he has an extensive bibliography, but it is not complete - it is biased.  As I read this book I kept thinking, "If heaven were truly like this, it's awful".  Chris, the main character, is tormented there by his thoughts about his wife and therefore cannot obtain any sense of peace.  There was no homecoming, no greeting or welcome upon his entrance.  He was alone with a dog.  The way Matheson writes, the books come across more like he is trying to sell something rather than as a story.  I really got tired of it quickly.  While many criticize the Christian view of Heaven, at least there one can experience peace, freedom from torment, and enjoy eternal life with others who have been faithful to Christ. 
 The res on the artwork here is less than miserable. The interface is high-tech circa 1996.   I'm dissappointed in this purchase. I would have thought it was fantastic when I bought my first PC in 1993 
 I found at a housewares store (Bed Bath & Beyond or the like) a shot glass with several different units of measurement: fluid ounces, teaspoons, tablespoons (in half-tablespoon increments) and ML's.  Much more useful than this product, especially if you're measuring for weight loss purposes and can have EXACTLY two and a half tablespoons of that salad dressing 
 This book tries hard to say that it is a book on search and not on Google. Indeed, even the reviews on the backcover tries hard to convince me that this is not a book on Google. However, I get the impression that this is a book that was probably originally intended as a book on Google, but was late to the game, and tries to be rebranded as a book on search. To the author's credit, he does add material on search that is more original, but the feeling that this book started out as a book on Google never left me. 
 So I ordered the magazine in Nov. 6, 2005. Its now Feb. 22nd, 2006 and the magazines (since I also ordered the Smithsonian and Scientific American) are nowhere to be seen. Of course, my account was quickly charged and at this pace, I'm guessing the whole genomic structure of all living organisms in this planet will be decoded before I receive any of them... so if you actually want to read this excellent magazine, it might be a better idea to get somewhere else.. 
 About three years ago, I purchased a copy of Richard Giles' masterful work, "Re-Pitching the Tent", quite possibly one of the best works on re-ordering church builidings I have seen in the last decade.  I frequently refer to it in my ministry, and have used that book many times for inspirations and ideas in liturgical quandries.  "Re-Pitching" was dignifed and respectful, and remains a wonderful read.  "Creating Uncommon Worship", however, would have been better suited to the title, "Kicking Out the Tent-Poles", because what was a wonderful beginning has now went sour.  First, let me highlight the strong points.  The photography is wonderful, and will fill the reader with food for thought.  The re-arrangment of the Philadelphia Cathedral depicted in the book is an excellent model for those seeking a return to basilican-style celebrations of the Eucharist.  The fonts were very readable, and the book has a wonderful layout.  Did I mention that the photographs were nice?  Now, for the remainder of my comments.  Rev. Giles' attitide towards those who love older forms of the liturgy is inexcusable.  At one point, Giles blasts away at a church in New England where the pastor celebrated the Eucharist ad orientem (facing 'east').  He makes many comments that suggest blatantly ignoring the rubrics of the liturgy, and even challenges (at points) the authority of the bishop.  Such an attitude on the part of a priest is inexcusable, and publishing it in such a manner as to encourage such behavior in other places is horrifying.  What Giles is commending to modern usage is the abandonment of, in essence, all tradition that he does not see befitting of the 'modern' Church.    Sadly, in his strive to be relavant, Giles misses out on the entire point of the Liturgy... to teach the truth.  His regular rampages about 'blurring the lines' between cleric and laity seem to indicate a raging anti-clericalisim, which is strange given the fact that he is an ordained priest of the Church of England and is functioning in the United States as the dean of a cathedral.  Please, don't get me wrong, there are plenty of gems in this book for consideration - though most of the theology is, in my opinion, at best contrived - yet generally rubbish.  Giles' main intent in writing this book seems to be his desire to further irritate those who are loyal to their ordination oaths and the rubrics of their liturgies.  In reading the book, I became so disgusted with Giles' attitude that I was tempted to go to the Church and shove the Altar back up against the wall and celebrate with my back to the people.  I sincerely hope that, in any further books, Giles would refrain from such an attitude display.  He has some good food for thought (his section on the Eucharistic Prayer, while still filled with jibes and barbs, is quite insightful), plowing through the weeds and brambles is too much work for me.  "Creating Uncommon Worship" will take up a not-so-honored place on my shelf for the time being, until I finally can justify selling it to someone else 
                  As you can tell by the header, I was disappointed by this movie. Since Kurt Russell plays the lead, I should not have been surprised, because the parts he plays are generally rather predictable and simplistic (Tango & Cash, Snake Plisskin, etc). I just don't picture Kurt as lead actor in a gritty, realistic drama...but, eternally the optimist, I hoped that this might be the exception. It wasn't.  The story involves two LA detectives, one a grizzled and thoroughly corrupt veteran (Russell) and the other a somewhat principled but weak-willed and easily manipulated rookie, Bobby Keough (Scott Speedman). Russell's character (Eldon Perry) is controlled and protected by an exceedingly corrupt superior officer, Jack Van Meter (nicely played by Brendan Gleeson), who uses Perry to further his profitable and flagrantly illegal interests.   If you have ever watched "The Shield" on FX cable network then you will be familiar with this general setup....a morally ambiguous detective is used to further his superior's agenda.....but here is the problem: The Shield (a television series) is vastly superior in every way: plot, acting, characterization, dialog, direction, etc. to this feature film. It is like comparing filet mignon to cheap hamburger. Once you see a quality, nuanced drama like The Shield, this movie and all like it are rendered unwatchable.   Characters in Dark Blue are caricatures with almost no depth. They guzzle whiskey and laugh about their flagrant crimes. The plot and dialog are contrived and unrealistic. There is no subtlety....no intellectually stimulating complexity. Eldon always does exactly as he is told: if mass-murdering thugs (employed and protected by his superior) are to be sheltered from arrest, simply go out and murder a couple of stray ex-cons and let them take the rap (posthumously) for the real criminals. Never mind that neither of the ex-cons is even close to being a plausible suspect. No one would be fooled by this ruse, except perhaps in this mindless movie.   Eldon gets his partner Keough to perform one of the cold-blooded murders ordered by Van Meter, and thus begins their downfall, because Keough has a spontaneous change of heart and suddenly cannot accept the guilt of his actions. One minute he is guzzling whiskey with his cronies and laughing about lying to a shooting review board, and the next he is overwrought with guilt. Not at all likely in real life, but it suits the plot.   Things gets even sillier when the partner (Speedman) then teams up with the assistant chief's (Ving Rhames) predictably beautiful ex-mistress (Michael Michelle) to try to arrest the real thugs and use them to bring down the whole perverted mess. Heaven forbid that he simply come forth and provide evidence to accomplish this end. What follows is a lengthy, confused, and poorly choreographed pursuit of the thugs and a predictable gun battle with equally predictable outcome.   The ultimate farce, however, is reserved for Eldon himself, who drives around South Central Los Angeles during the peak of the Rodney King riots trying to find and arrest a black suspect....which he easily accomplishes....and then drives away without a scratch. This reaches the level of surrealistic absurdity and is an insult to the true horror of the riots.  Equally unconvincing is Eldon's spontaneous change of heart at the end of the movie, during his promotion ceremony (such irony), when he delivers a rambling, preposterous and unconvincing indictment of his father, himself, and his evil superior....which is simplistically and immediately accepted (in true movie fashion) by all who hear it, and who then immediately jump to arrest and condemn the naughty superior. This is silly, implausible, and an insult to any viewer above the age (and maturity) of a 10-year old. Jump up at your next promotion ceremony and deliver a rambling condemnation of your superior and see what happens. This type of naive nonsense occurs in only one place: the movies....bad ones.   If you were thrilled by Tango & Cash, and thought Snake Plissken was a brilliantly-portrayed anti-hero, then by all means hit the "Buy It Now" button for this DVD. But, if you want complexity, subtlety, realism, plausibility, and infinitely superior acting, plot, characterization, and direction....do yourself a huge favor and use your money to either subscribe to FX on cable, or buy/rent DVD's of The Shield series....filet mignon is always better than cheap hamburger 
 I used to think he was great, till I caught the Director's Cut of 'Das Boot.'  All of a sudden you're confronted with this ridiculous synthesizer music that wasn't in the original, and the spell is broken.  Let's not even talk about 'Air Force One.'  Now I've seen 'The Perfect Storm' twice, and I own the book, but I still haven't read it because I'm reasonably sure the book MUST suck if the movie is this bad.  And I'm sorry New England, but what are Gloucestermen anyways, except for great rapers of the high seas?  What will they NOT do for a buck, you might ask.  Ok, they are not as bad as the Japanese, but they all stalk the world on floating slaughterhouses like there's no tomorrow.  Watching this movie definitely made me take fish off the menu.  Sure you will find excitement aplenty, amped up to eleven.  Even experience fleeting moments when you might ponder the plight of seafarers throughout history.  I even like some of the principal actors, but in the end all they do is make a pretty bad movie slightly more interesting than it should be.  This just doesn't stand up to repeat viewings.  Unless you enjoy feeling like a sucker.  Do you 
 Eerdmans should stick to theological tomes, rather than embarassing themselves with yet another propaganda piece for the Yankee cause. Guelzo fails to mention how Lincoln trampled upon the Constitution (Illegal arrests, Intimidation of duly elected leaders (e.g. Maryland State Legislature), and making war upon peaceful states which legally withdrew from the voluntary Union). A Government for the people, by the people vanished [Jeffersonian Constitutional Republic replaced with Consolidated Absolutism] with Lincoln's insistence that the Federal government existed before the States. The right of secession in America, beginning with the Declaration of Independence, was taught for decades until Sen. Sumner thundered from the Senate floor that this was a perpetual Union (Lincoln decided to carry this torch at the expense of 600,000 innocents). Lincoln's Emancipation proclamation was none other than a war measure (slaves were being used to build the capital and slaves were only declared free in Confederate held territory)encouraging slaves to revolt: this did not happen. Guelzo also fails to mention that slavery in the South was dying out and that roughly 10% of her people ever owned slaves. Guelzo failed to point out that the Emancipation Proclamation was illegal since it would have to take a Constitutional amendment to change the Constitution. Furthermore, his book fails to point out that the Emancipation had no jurisdiction in the Confederate States of America since the Southern states were no longer a member of the Union. I'm amazed at how people continue to admire a man who waged war on people who decided to follow in the footsteps of their fathers: Revolutionary War Heroes. The South was right, and the Northern propaganda machine is still filling the public mind with lies. If Abraham Lincoln embodies what a Christian is, then I'm not one, and evangelicals fascination with a man who was not converted until after Gettyburg is dangerous.  Furthermore, I have no respect for a man who waged war on my native state: North Carolina 
 We used these bottles for three weeks, and we are very skeptical that they actually work as well as they are supposed to.  There are some additional drawbacks as well. 1)  These leak in travel.  Twice we've gone to the park with 7oz, and arrived with 4 and a mess in the bag. 2)  We see no difference in reducing gas. And while these are designed to take gas away from the collar on, what about all the air in the nipple where the air first enters?  Is this a gimmic? 3)  The flow is too fast.  We went from bottles with smaller holes and less flow to these, which are far too fast for an infant

 While this book brought up some very good issues about how terrible overweight people are treated, I found it preachy and many times got irritated with Lara's whining.    I can understand that she's feeling sorry for herself because she used to be a beauty queen and now she's one hundred pounds overweight.  But I don't want to read that same thing a zillion times, right up to the end of the book.  It made me lose sympathy for Lara, and by the end of the book I thought she was a stuck up brat.  I also had difficulty with her disease, Axell-Crowne Syndrome.  It isn't real - the author made it up.  And because of this disease, Lara felt superior to other overweight people because gaining weight wasn't her fault.  Stuck up brat strikes again.  To top it off, she gets mad at other people for assuming she was overweight from eating too much, yet she assumed that exact thing with other overweight people.  How does she know the person she's looking down on isn't also suffering from Axell-Crowne Syndrome?  It's hard to relate to a hypocrite, especially one who never seems to learn her lesson and grow from it.  I didn't like other messages in the book either, such as Suzanne's gorgeous boyfriend, Tristan, hating that Suzanne is overweight.  If the point of the book is to say not everyone can be thin and that's okay, then why doesn't Tristan love Suzanne for who she is, regardless of her weight?     Anyway, I could list all the things I didn't like about this book, but it would take too long and I've got other things I'd rather do 
 AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!!!  IT IS NOT WIDESCREEN AS ADVERTIZED!!!!  I have ordered and returned this product 3 times. It is not widescreen. There is no option to for viewing it as widescreen.  Amazon has no explanation for the mistake and unfortunately they will not correct the web page.  This leads to an interesting question.  Why does Mr. Leach state in his review that the disk offers a widescreen option when it doesn't?  Either Amazon is massively screwing up the order or he is not reviewing this actual disk from Amazon.  If that's the case, he should not be providing a review on it.  
 I just purchased this book, and I was really excited when I received it.  However, after 5 attempts of trying to install the CD-ROM, I gave up, and... the worest thing is, I tried to visit the website the book provided, in order to get to contact with them & ask for help... I was not allowed to view the page... cuz they blocked a lot of IP address, and the cable company that I have is on their list.........   If you want to get a USEFUL CD-ROM for drug reference, don't get this book... it will cause you a lot of headache & troubles.  Get Nursing200X drug handbook published by Springhouse.  The software is good, and I never had any problem with it 
 I bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane.  Not one of my better decisions.  Very wordy, and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it's totally absurd -- reminds me of the way the cops talked in "Dragnet."  We are talking zero development of characters.  Perhaps Mr. Woods feels he doesn't need to give any depth to characters that he's been writing about in previous books.  Well, he's wrong.  You basically just don't care about these people.  They aren't real, and they talk weird.  Not much action either, unless you count actions like:  they got in the car; they got in the boat; they got in the plane.  You get the picture.  This is another case of a well-known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money.  Don't fall into his trap like I did.  There are a lot better books out there. 
 I am a prolific reader of historical novels, so when I saw "Antiquity" by Norman Cantor, I was intrigued.  Inside the covers, however, lies one of the worst researched, terribly opinionated, and worse, outright disingenuous books purporting to be historical analysis I have ever read.  One could chalk this up to a novice's first attempt, but Cantor is a well known author with his work on Medieval life.  Perhaps, under a rush of a deadline he forgot that history is supposed to be told truthfully.  He skewers or ignores facts, presents blantantly opinionated views which leave a novice reader with a wholly untruthful view of what happened, and provides no documentation of research for his outlandish postulations (presented as fact) of actions, locales or politics which he covers.  My greatest concern, is that there are what apperared to me to be several anti-Semetic references or characterizations, several disparaging remarks of middle-eastern cultures, and an haughty presentation of the Macedonian Empire's world view. Has Cantor lectured so long that he thinks the whole world are easily intimidated as his 18-22 year old audiences?    If you are wanting to know about ancient history, this book isn't for you.  If truthfulness doesn't matter, well then, you might enjoy what really is a self-aggrandizing doorstop 
 In fact I found it to be pretty much easily summed up with one word-CRAP 
 The gutsy performance of Bridget Fonda is the only saving grace of this ultra-violent, nihilistic remake of the French hit LA FEMME NIKITA.  Director John Badham manages to keep the action tense and suspenseful, but the writers expect a lot from viewers.  How can one truly identify and/or empathize with Fonda's character?  She's really a cold-blooded killer, with little grace or worth.  Even after her Pygmalion like transformation, she is still the same ruthless woman, only we are now supposed to sympathize with her and wish her well?  This reviewer can't do that.  Gabriel Byrne struggles gamely with his likewise unlikeable character; Dermot Mulroney only manages to look goofy in his puppydog idolization of Fonda; and poor Anne Bancroft tries to be the cold, but caring, mentor.  It's to Fonda's credit that she manages to at least get us in her corner, guiltily or not 
 You take a plastic CD, that you spent a good $ 15 on...you're anxious to hear the brutality that your teammates brag of towards this album while hitting the showers.  The open riff is pumping your adrenaline because it sounds like chaos is set to erupt...but instead of hearing a ferocious scream to welcome the evil you get a wimpy sounding " Bring it on " " Yea Boy"!  Yet your amazed! The mainstream follower is shocked!  Why? I'll tell you.  Because they don't know squatt about metal.  It's preppy mainstream excrament!  You'll hear positive reactions from the crowd that think Linkin Park and breaking benjamins are the future of metal!  The people that thought Follow the Leader was the 1st Korn album!  The people that think Godsmack is the music to pump up to before a football game, getting in a fight, or better yet being in the NAVY!  The people who only know these Slipknot songs " wait and bleed ", " Duality " and " Vemillon Pt.1". The people that thought Papa Roach was mosh music!  These are the lifestyles of the upscale who only get influenced by what is broadcasted on modern radio and is too afraid to observe what lies in the underground! I'm talking about a money destroyer! I'll admit myself the music on this album is hard hitting and got some groove.  But that Fred Durst is ruins it!  3 Dollar Bill Y'all ( although a corny title ) was an excellent album for what it is....Significant Other was fair for that time being but the more I listened to it, the more I despised it!  The more Fred Durst opened his mouth, the more I wished for his demise! He is the true definition of a sellout, a joke, and above all a talentless destroyer ( Like Kid Rock ).  If you want to jam to something with a hard hitting heavy sound with hip hop influence?  Get these albums: Hed(p.e.)-Broke Limp Bizkit- Three Dollar Bill Y'all Reveille Darwins Waiting Room Snot- Get Some Slipknot- Self titled EP Anthrax/Public Enemy any Rage Against the Machine or perhaps some old school Beastie Boys! 
 Although Petra has a sweet voice, I felt her songs sounded juvenile and scattered. 
 I am puzzled at why Sampson would set out to deminish Jones and his family.   I noted that some of "his" facts are actually completely different in other books that are exhaustively researched such as Mark Frost's book The Grand Slam and others I have read including Down the Fairway by Jones himself.  Even if everything negative he came up with was true it isn't really very much in light of the great man that he was.  He was a man of impeccable character but he was a human being.  He was sensitive and conscientious, intellegent, honest and gracious above all.    Even so, I enjoy reading anything about Jones which has led to my reading of other books of this era and books about Walter Hagen etc.  I enjoyed the pictures 
 The ideas behind 15 minutes aren't bad at all. Take one Robert DeNiro, put him in New York, mix him with some American-dream hunting Eastern Europeans on a killing spree, and try to provoke some emotions, and have a sly dig at the American justice system. Lets see...nothing happened...only repulse.  If, like everyone else, you plan on watching this film because DeNiro is in it, you will be dissapointed. He puts in a tired performance, almost as if he knows the film is a load of B.S. The attempt to be hard-hitting goes horribly wrong, instead it's just repulsive over the top violence, and its pointless...naked prostitute gets hacked to pieces, why? There are ways to create provoking films with such violence but they have to have meaning, such as 8mm (the horrible subject of snuff movies, hard-hitting meaningfull film), 15 minutes is far from meaningfull. We all know there are some deranged psychopaths out there doing just that, but when converting it to a film, it needs a deeper meaning, otherwise it turns into melodramatic Hollywood [...].  If you like brain-dead gore and violence, lack of plot and cringing melodrama. Go ahead 
 I admit it, the 12 steps to Raw foods should have given away that this book is just a rehash of 12 steps.   What I expected was an actual 12 step program to familiarizing myself with raw food, and processes, and grocery lists.   This book is so subjective it kind of turned me off from the raw movement. It's a little creepy actually. Someone, please suggest me a better raw food book 
 I can't believe that there are people out there mindless enough to believe this.  For those who do, sorry to disappoint you, there is no conspiracy.  The author has no understanding of what "new agers" are like.  I was always taught that books held knowledge, imagine my disappointment when I read thru this!  If only open mouths came w/open minds...  In short, don't waste your hard earned money.  If you absolutely must, then educate yourself on the so called "new age" and have an unbiased opinion 
 This "novel" is supposed to be about a personal assistant to the stars.  While I was excited with the premise, my first upset was to discover that this was written as a novel.  Would it not have worked way better as non-fiction? It was my belief that this book was based on the author's personal experiences.  Yes, it would have been a little dicey to make it non fiction, but certainly lots more fun.  As it stands, this book is full of stories about "make believe" stars.  The author has our main character jumping from one star to the other without much coordination and throughout the whole thing, we are also subjected to silly comments from the main character.  Also, are we expected to believe that the "star assistant" works for all these people and does not even have contracts with any of them? Smacks of plot advancement to me.  Overall, unfortunately, this book was boring for me. I did not even want to attempt to try to figure out who the "fake" stars may represent in real life.  Next time - try writing a non fiction memoir - that would be interesting 
 It is a waste of money and a big disappointment.  I will be returning it. 
 I am a Nancy Drew fan...for over thirty years..as my mother was before me and my daughter after me.  This rewitten version is not up to the thrills and chills of the edition by Mildred Wirt Benson in the 1930's.  This  edition lacks the intrige of the first..it is more "up to date"  and P.C. than the first, but I suggest that anyone who loves Nancy and has  only read this book obtain a copy of the original that has been published  by Applewood Books..it even has the fantastic old illustrations 
 Moore sets out to blame guns, rather than the people who make Prozac and other 'designer' seditives for the massacre at Columbine High School and runs afoul of Mr. NRA himself, Moses, better known as Charleton  Heston. Heston, gentlemanly as he is defeats all futile arguments Moore, an anit-gun (mostly) leftist has v. the Second Amendment. Long live the second Amendment, otherwise the First Amendment is gone, too! Moore should wake and wise up. Better Moore efforts that are highly recom- mended are: The Big One, Fahrenheit 9/11, Roger and Me and even the un- derrated Canadian Bacon 
 I was inspired to purchase this cd after loving Bebel Giberto's "Tanto Tempo", as Suba was credited for one of my favorite songs.  However, for those  who revel in the true Brazilian sounds of samba and bossa nova, Suba's sound is not what you are accustomed to.  After listening to a few tracks I was bored with the repetitive techno sound.  While there are a few interesting sounds here, give me real musicians and sensuous rhythmns over electronic sound 
 I absolutely loved the vignettes in this book but found much of her information to be incorrect.  While I do agree that medicine has destroyed the magic of birth, I do not believe that it is a commercial conspiracy against women.  Women are able to research pregnancy and childbirth at any time (currently) so it's not 'the man's' fault is she chooses to remain ignorant on the subjects.  I had a wonderful labor and birth with my son--I had an epidural, an Iv due to an infection, and pain medication because I was terrified of going through the same pain my mother and sister did with their children.  I felt my son come out, I was not groggy, he was not groggy and we rested quite comfortably for 2 hours before anyone weighed him or even bathed him.  I found a lot of the information presented was outdated and incorrect.  I do not know anyone who was separated from their infant by force but I do know a few women who insisted that the baby be removed from their sight!!!!!  I did not let my son out of my signt and haven't for 15 months!  I would like to add that I refused an internal monitor and my nurse respectfully listened to me.  My baby was not taken from me at any time, I breastfed immediately after birth, he slept with me, my husband stayed in my room ,did not have to wear scrubs or anything unnatural and we were an extremely happy family!    I loved labor and delivery and all the pressure in my back and birth canal was worth it!  This is worth the read but please do not base your entire pregnancy and birth on the information presented here.  Research your options, read academic and medical journals, read about midwives, read about OBGs and most importantly, listen to your gut 
 If you have never studied logic, this is the book for you.  But if you have, find something else.  This book is slow and it spends too much time on the deductive system in propositional logic.  Tedious 
 Ms Lafray is lacking in authenticity, in addition for a reviewer not to have so many mistakes, even in issues a simple as the correct spelling of the restaurant that started the Elena Ruth, she has it misspelled. Proof reading anyone, and the recipes are not authentic. 
 My understanding is that this book is an accessible summary of the ideas Catsells presents in his three volume magnum opus, the Information Age (which starts with the Network Society). If this is so, I am definitely not missing much by not having read the trilogy. This is a really bad piece of sociology, characterized by a technologically deterministic analysis. Why did I give it two stars instead of one then? Well, it does have some OK parts. Catsell's analysis of the origins of the internet is an interesting bit of the sociology of technology and what saves the book from pure technological determinism. He also presents some convincing data (gathered by other people) that use of the internet for socializing does not suck people into an on-line world, alienating them from the world of face-to-face interaction; this happens in the case of a few troubled people, but most people use the internet to enhance their already existing off-line relationships. The rest of the book basically argues that the network format of the internet is reshaping the rest of society in its image, with everything from big business to governments to social movements adopting a network form in response to the rise of this new technology. This is, frankly, ludicrous reductionism. It doesn't even stand up to a simple test of chronology--a lot of the developments that Castells argues are driven by the internet predate the explosion of ist usage in the mid-1990s. As Castells himself admits, businesses were already taking on more of a network form before the internet appeared big time on the scene, and social movement scholars have shown the same is true of transnational social movements. On top of this, Castells shows an effusive enthusiasm for all things networked, whether they be transnational corporations or the transnational social movements that oppose these same corporations. I'm really at a loss to understand how one can enthuse about both of these opposed phenomena. Castells does see some of the problems with the new network society--loss of job security and the digital divide, for instance--but he tends to downplay these. And his solution to these problems tends to come down to more of the same--more internet access, more network social organization. Talk about a narrow vision 
 Why? Someone tell me why. Someone e-mail me and explain to me why. There is nothing to gain here. Nothing to be learned, nothing to excite, no story. Why? Seriously, is there any documentation that might explain WHY this thing (not a film) exists. Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is so unprecedented in it's poorness, that it doesn't even succeed in being a dumb slasher flick. Let me reiterate. The filmmakers actually FAILED at the least complicated genre in the book. If I wanted a series of randomly assembled images leading nowhere I would have rented "Week End".  The only reason to see this is that ever crafty curiosity value. Yes, you will be compelled to watch, if only to observe some clue as to why both Matthew McConaughey (pre-"A Time to Kill") and Renée Zellweger (pre-"Jerry Maguire") accepted the lead roles (the clue never comes). Texas Chain Saw fans will, of course, feel the completist need to see this, the death knell of the series. And finally, I think just the concept of Leatherface as a shrieking cross-dresser will garnish a few bewildered viewers. But believe me folks, this still doesn't answer the ultimate question: Why? Why?! WHY? 
 The SkinTight cover is cool. Works pretty well with the unit, but the belt clip SUCKS! It's big and bulky and locks in over the mute switch on the Treo and it sometimes slides the mute switch over to mute or vise versa. 
 This is the first (and last) book by David Baldacci that I've ever read. He is one of the worst best-selling writers I've ever read. He writes almost every sentence of dialog in the form of a Tom Swifty sentence ("We've got to get out of here," said King, menacingly). His flair for melodramatic overstatement is second to none. The actions of the characters make no sense at all. For example, when Michelle sees a laser from a gun sight pointed at the chest of her trusty sidekick, Sean King, she says, "Sean, don't move!" instead of "Sean, dive for cover!!!" Bottom line - save your money and buy something worthwhile 
 This doll scares me half to death.  It has a very creepy voice and a creepier laugh.  It reminds me of a female Chucky and I'm terrified that it might come alive in the middle of the night and kill me.  I don't want it in my house anymore, so I'm going to give it to charity and hope my daughter forgets about it 
 I am kind of in the middle of the other reviewers.  It DID have a "different" and unpredictable story line.  i took it that he was dreaming, since the state names and money werent real.  the kid was great.  the problem, as usual, is Hollywood ruined it...what could have been a great movie my kids could watch, they throw in a sex scene in the kid's car back seat while he is sitting next to the car, and then of course they have to have the kid throw in a couple of "F" words.  And of course Hollywood doesnt let us who object to that buy a version that has that edited, or permit DVD players that allow you to skip those parts.  if it wasnt for the trash above, i would give it 4 stars for its uniqueness.  If you are morale and have children, you dont want this movie 
 Extremely difficult to dig through the excessive examples in order to find the relevant theorems and results. Because of this, the problems at the end of each chapter become exercises in tedium, as more time is spent searching for the necessary theorems in the text than in actually working out the solution.   I do not recommend 
 Dear Sean,  Thanks for sending me your book "Deliver Us from Evil : Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism." Before I put the book down and turn off my light and go to sleep I just wanted to dash off a quick letter to you so you could clarify a thing or two for me. Let me get this straight. You'd like to see all Liberals vanish from the face of the American political system and have only Conservative Republicans running the show...is that right? Hmm...Let me see, if my memory serves me right there were some political states or nations that did function for a while under a one party system. There was the Soviet Union 1917-1991, Fascist Italy 1923-1945, Nazi Germany 1933-1945. Those are three just off the top of my head. They didn't like Liberalism either. Well, Sean I got to get going. I'm sure I'll write again soon.  All my best,  Bill  PS. Remember, fanaticism is far from being fair and balanced 
 I love to read plays and performed in many. I was so curious about this play-the book was in excellent condition-got it in time. No complaints there. I read the play and thought it was the worst play. IT's not "cutting edge" just dark and morbid. I know we want to go beyond the line but this was just dumb. I would never direct this play and I am directing in Chicago..but to each is own-if you liked it that's what makes the world go round..enjo 
 It appears that John Jakes likes to write about conflict.  This book is comprised of conflict in war, conflict in relationships etc. etc. To me his characters do not seem real.  Also, I don't like the way he creates situations where he reverses right and wrong. It is a book that lifts immorality as a good thing. This was my first and last John Jakes book.  
 ... but if you loved the movie What the Bleep Do We Know, then you will be doubtless swept away by the warm and fuzzy feeling of this trite plot and rather cursory and one-dimensional examination of Western philosophy, which completely dismisses or ignores Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Husserl, Schopenhauer, Habermas, Foucault, Heidegger, and others (and totally misses the mark in its analysis of Sartre's humanism). 
 This is a book about our society and yet I am left wondering how "everything bad for us" actually affects our society. I believe the author's underlying presumption is that improving the individual improves our society as a whole. This societal analysis, however, is completely missing.  The book can be summed up as follows: 1. Games and software are more complex, therefore our problem-solving ability has increased. 2. TV is more complex, therefore our emotional intelligence has increased. 3. The Internet gives us new ways to connect with others, therefore our communication abilities have increased.  The litmus test for all this is increasing IQ scores.  Part I of the book goes to great lengths to explain how an individual's "mental muscle" is increased through popular media: games, TV, software, and the Internet. Part II asserts that increased IQ scores are the proof that our mental muscle is increasing.  The individual may be benefiting from popular media, but is our society benefiting? Are more technological breakthroughs happening? Are we better able to piece together disparate facts provided by the media and government into a cohesive whole? Is software easier to use so we can more easily accomplish our goals? Are communities and homes being designed better so they improve communication between neighbors and families? Can we better recognize the underlying motives of our politicians? Are we making great strides to decrease global warming, air and water pollution, forest depletion, species extinction, famine, homelessness, cancer and disease, gender and racial inequality, and the distribution of wealth?  If our ability to see connections and solve problems has improved, why do a vast number of Americans still believe there is a connection between 911 and Iraq? Why do we not recognize that the diversity of plant and animal species on the planet directly affects our well-being? Why do we seem incapable of understanding that many of the divisive issues we focus upon (e.g., school prayer, flag burning, abortion, gay marriage) are simply manifestations of larger societal problems (e.g., inequality, poverty, domination and control).  How is the popular media affecting these societal and technological issues? Is it making them worse? This is the missing part of the book that I hope will be addressed in another edition 
 I agree wholeheartedly with Kenneth Ryan's review.  This book was "recommended" reading in one of my English classes at UCLA several years ago, and I bought it, but just now picked it up for a read.  The problem is that the main character is so vapid that I simply did not CARE what happened to her.  It has always been my firm belief that one must identify with, care about, or even despise a main character to care enough to keep reading.  This novel was painful to finish; who cares what happens to these people?  I agree that whatever "splash" the book made in its day came from the shock value it would have had because of the amorality of its characters.  It's hard to shock us these days, and the book is now just plain uninteresting 
 While this book is a good attempt at placing statistical topics necessary to toxicology in one spot, the mistakes are inexcusable.  Many formula are incorrect as well as text referring to the wrong tables or data. Therefore, one begins to lose trust in the information presented.  Be careful if you use this book 
 Ken Russell is a gifted director, as his erratic career has proved, but even the great Vanessa Redgrave can't save this one. "The Devils," a gaudy, loud attempt to blend period detail with stark surrealism, went painfully awry. Grisly images of plague victims, quack cures, peculiar enemas, and Oliver Reed being burned at the stake were doubtless meant to provide realistic detail--unfortunately, they are merely stomach-turning. A stocky, wild-eyed Oliver Reed is sadly lacking in erotic appeal as Father Grandier, the womanizing priest of a seventeenth-century French town, and most of the other characters are so unlikable that one wishes the entire town had been burned at the stake. Gemma Jones is one bright spot as Grandier's innocent love interest, and Ms. Redgrave gives her all to the thankless role of Sister Jeanne, but the film as a whole is unpalatable and disturbing. Not for the faint of heart 
 Personally, I found this book too advanced. I love Nozick's The Examined Life - Philosophical Meditations. Each chapter of the Meditations is an adventure, but Explanations was over my head,  More academic people than I would no doubt like it.  Nozick was a genius.   Richard Waller Albany GA 
 I paged through this book at the store , but did not buy it.  It looked promising until I came to the chapter about 88(?) kids caught going to school with guns each day.  A shocking statistic yes, but the author uses this cold "fact" to put a political spin on gun control.  Partway into this chapter, it is stated that if the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, well known as the Assault Weapons Ban, is allowed to sunset, then guns such as the AK-47 and Uzi will once again be allowed to be sold in this country.  Anyone who has ever read the AWB of 1994 knows that ownership of so-called assault weapons was never banned, no weapons were confiscated as a direct result of the passage of this law.  The law merely prohibted importation and new manufacture of nineteen weapons by name, and some others by description.  Assault weapons made prior to 1994 were allowed to be owned, bought and sold in the USA.  Gun makers made mostly cosmetic changes to their firearms to allow them to be legally sold after the ban went into effect.  The number of semi-automatic weapons in the USA actually went up, especially right before the law was passed in 1994.  The AWB of 1994 certainly had no effect on the number of kids who bring handguns to school.  I wonder what spin the author has placed on the other facts presented in this book.      
 Utterly stupid.  Does not deserve the title. Total misrepresentation 
 Out of Place : A Memoir is one long whining session.  All Said does is whine and bellyache.    But then again, all the Palestinians do is complain and whine.  When given their own territory, all the Palestinians do is complain and whine  It is the Palestinians that gave the world suicide bombers, and they have the gall to complain.  Said defends those very bombers.  The ones who kill Americans.  This book is a lot of fiction.    I spoke with Eddy Said once.  He admitted the Palestinians were wrong and the Israeli's right.  But he said that any Arab who publicly admits that is a dead man.  Said had a lot of freedom in Israel.  If only the Arab states would have given them that same level of freedom. 
 The manufacturer added little "tabs" because these labels are so thin that they tear when you try to remove them from the backing.  The tabs don't help much and they don't tear cleanly from the label.  A solution to a problem that creates yet another problem.  The best solution would be to purchase another brand.  
 Please think this DVD is recorded in 1986. More worse, this is recorded as a documentary. Sound quality is worst. After I bought this and DVD of "Company" (same, worst sound quality DOCUMENTARY), I suspect the word "concert" or "soundtrack" in DVD title 
 Maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow.  It is the first mystery novel that I have read by a female author and I hope that it is not representative of the gender.  But, by the reviews here, all by women, I can see that Jance writes to that crowd.  Her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible. If you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you.  It is amazing that Jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue, the insulin bottle.  Jance gives no indication that Oak Vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story. Do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time.  If you want a good mystery read Coben, Crais, Patterson or Michael Connely 
   I "enjoyed" viewing this film and seeing "the good guy" win. But, "there must be a better way" to resolve conflicts, "a better way" to punish bad guys,  "a better way to deal with evil" than just go out and kill everyone involved!  We live in a violent world with terrorists and suicide murderers and car bombings and killing our troops in Iraq and The Sunnis killing the Shiites and vice versa, etc..etc.   I always believe there MUST be "a better way" besides everyone killing the other guys.  So, that's what I have against this film.  As for the film itself, I enjoyed the musical theme and the acting of Clint Eastwood and the acting of all the other members of the cast. It is a "good film" except for the violence.   And, yes, "the good guy" does win in the end---I'm happy about that!  And, I enjoyed the photography also.  So, yes, definitely SEE the film but as you do, could you possibly think of "a better way" for resovling issues rather than the violence depicted in this film?  Email:boland7214@aol 
 First off, a big thumbs down to the packing of this product! Mine arrived in the mail...BROKEN, and the box was full of holes due to a lose product inside the box because of poor packaging! I wonder if I lost something in shipping? Not sure because the box was half empty with only the product and a tiny instruction booklet. It made me realize just how cheap this product is made.  BOOOO to Amazon for selling such a cheap product for soo much money!   This makes me question if Amazon.com is such a great place to do my shopping 
 This is my first (and definantly last) IGOS published book. It is astonishingly badly written and the author states in the introduction that it's source is from "channeled" material to boot. The fake leather cover has the cheap appearance of a junior high school annual. It's hard for this reviewer to understand what makes this poor tome "ancient" or "dark", or for that point "magick 
 There is a case for decrepit cinematic 'crud' being universal. This is it. Get Ozu's "Tokyo Story" instead (out on Criterion). That is a piece of timeless lyrical cinema. This film merely confirms that risque cinema quickly loses its potency (losing it in favour of a ephemeral revolutionary stance). A Waste 
 I'm amazed that this book is for MBA level students!  I am currently an undergraduate student and have the opportunity to use this textbook for a finance class and find this book very vague on termology and not very helpful when it comes to difficult concepts.  Anyone with basic knowledge of business can understand the book so that's why it amazes me that this book is used for MBA's 
 Disappointing, to say the least. Poor sound qualityl 2 channel stereol I mean c'mon; no surround sound This is 2006! They could have mastered the picture quality, as well 
 It did not fit my phone and I was forced to go out and but another one 
 i gave it 2 stars as i felt that overall i would not recommend this book 
 I did not receive the correct product that I ordered.  I informed the seller and he stated that I would need to resell on ebay myself.  Very disappointed with his service.  kell 
 I bought two sets of these towels. The ad said name brand, but when I saw the label, I had never heard of them. They feel nice, soft and cushy. But they are not very absorbent. When drying my hands, after repeated rubbing and patting,  my hands were still wet. My old towels (17 years old) do a much better job of drying me off quickly 
 Congrats Mr. Bukowski!  You win the prize for being the first-ever book that I just couldn't make it through.  60 pages.  That's all I could read before I threw it in the trash.      Such filth (and I'm in construction, should hear MY mouth) and pointless drivel.  Completely disjointed - and not the stories to each other, but within each story.  How in the world did this guy ever get to be published?  Buy something else.  Anything else.  Just DON'T READ THIS BOOK! 
 I don't know anyone would like to read this book unless they are Afrian Americans. In "How Capatalism Underdeveloped Black America," the author writes the only way to achieve economic, political and social development for Blacks is to overthrow Captalist system in United States. As the author said, since the country is dominated by racist, and sexist white Americans, a bloody revolution has to be acted. The first phase of the socialist revolution is voting for progressive and anticapitalist politicians. The second phase is creating a chaotic living condition in America so that government has to cooperate with revoluntists. After the success of the socialist reforms, and totally eliminated captalism in the nation. They are going to support other countries to achieve "equality", too. Our country is going to be working class based nation, with universal health care, volunteer military officers, and equal-paid wage. 
 Although John Stanley's book covers a lot of great movies, there are many problems with the overall context. For example, he seems to only have a vague recollection of a lot of the movies. Because, a lot of reviews get the stories completely wrong. (HELP's plot is not about the Beatles looking for Ringo's magic ring. Everybody knows that!)Some actors are credited with the wrong roles. Also, there are many glaring spelling errors and a slight continuity problem: A title will say "see altertnate title", and that title and review would not be in the book! Mr. Stanley, do a little more research on your films and a more careful job of copy editing and you'll have an invaluable book. The more I read your current volume, the more mistakes I find and the more I feel I could write a better book myself 
 This book though looks simple and pretends to present concepts in a lucid manner, does not match international standards. Very few examples are present with less/no illustrations. I struggled with this book for almost 2 years to understand the concepts as this book was the only popular book in my UG college and was readily available in our library. It has ideally no practical examples which can easily discourage reader. After reading contemporary books from Prof Roy Yates and Prof Leon-Garcia, I could do little favor for this book by giving 1 star.   However, one who is already thorough with concepts can use this book for revision. There is a huge element of risk involved in starting with this book to learn probability concepts. 
 "A Walk to Remember, is my favorite book.  I have read it at least three times.  You have all kinds of emotions when you read this book.  First you will smile, then you will find yourself crying.  It almost takes your breath away when you read about the love these two young people share.  Has you read this story, Nicholas Sparks makes you feel like you have know this couple all there lives. I highly recommed this book to anyone that loves romance.  And that believes in fate.  
 "River Run Red" is a retelling of tired old lies.  In 1871 a Congressional investigation cleared Nathan Bedford Forrest not only of his alleged involvement with the KKK but also reinvestigated the "Ft. Pillow Massacre" and found that were that while there was evidence that there were isolated incidents along the riverbank Forrest personally stopped them as soon as he arrived on-scene.  If there was so much "proof" of a "massacre" why was Forrest not charged with a crime even after an in-depth Congressional investigation?  Forrest took 39 United States Colored Troops (USCT) as prisoner and, according the Federal Official Records, also turned over the 14 most severely wounded USCT to the Acting Master of the U.S. Steamer Silver Cloud.  These were hardly acts consistent with a "massacre."  Forrest was accused of ordering the burning of Union barracks with wounded Union soldiers inside.  In the Federal Official Records Lieutenant Daniel Van Horn, Sixth U.S. Colored Heavy Artillery, reported, "Lieutenant John D. Hill, Sixth U. S. Heavy Artillery, was ordered outside the fort to burn some barracks, which he, with the assistance of a citizen who accompanied him, succeeded in effecting."  Mr. Ward wrote that, "When Union Gen. William H. Bradford's soldiers, white and black, finally put up their hands, most, perhaps 400 or more, were cut down."  Lieutenant Van Horn also reported that, "There never was a surrender of the fort, both officers and men declaring they never would surrender or ask for quarter."  Who would know better whether or not there was a surrender - an author with no reservations about lying or a Union officer who was an eyewitness participant writing his report only days after the fact?  Since the author apparently could not find fundamental references commonly used by real historians - the Federal Official Records and the Congressional records - we must question how such a book could possibly be considered to be "meticulously researched" unless the author "meticulously researched" only those records which supported his position.  During the War 45 Black men rode with Forrest as servants, teamsters, foragers, scouts, and even as his personal armed bodyguards.  Convinced he would die in battle, the freed them in 1863 and ALL remained with him through the War and beyond.  In 1875 Forrest gave a speech in Memphis to a Black political and social group.  His speech included the following:  "We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, live in the same land, and why should we not be brothers and sisters . . . Although we differ in color, we should not differ in sentiment . . . I thank you for the flowers, and assure you that I am with you in heart and hand."  Hardly the words of "racist mind-set" as Andrew Ward alleged.  It is clear that the "racist mind-set" is possessed by Mr. Ward, not Forrest.  It is irresponsible to promote Mr. Ward's litany of hate without questioning his motivations or methodology.  "The first law of the historian is that he shall never dare utter an untruth.  The second is that he shall suppress nothing that is true.  Moreover, there shall be no suspicion of partiality in his writing, or of malice." - Cicero (106-43 B.C.)

 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 I have owned this joke of a camera for over a year now, so as someone with alot of experience with it, I advise you NOT TO BUY ONE.  I wouldn't reccomend this camera if it was only $19.95 and came with a free sledgehammer to take your anger out on it when you realize you just wasted twenty bucks...  - Without buying a memory card, this camera holds a pathetic number of pictures at any setting above VGA. - Non HP memory cards are incompatible. - It EATS UP batteries, seriously. - It shuts off without warning for no reason whatsoever. - It will often not recognize rechargable batteries as being rechargable.  At this point, I am shopping for a new camera because my M407 claims that brand new batteries are "depleted" and shuts off, lovely 
 A theory intends to explain reality and make a truth claim. In this book, the theory presented does not apply to any form of social reality, and its truth claim can neither be verified, neither falsified. The author presents, somewhere from the dimness of deep metaphysical outerspace, a series of half baked philosophical assertions about IR theory that are at best incoherent and erroneous. In essence it is a pot of opportunistic eclecticism that nowhere achieves a synthesis that smells of coherence. Although he wants to explain all IR questions, he achieves to provide an understanding for none of them. What pretends to be a theory is nothing but a wolkenkuckucksheim that demonstrates the limits of a 'science' based on opportunism rather than truth, and its devoted students would probably continue joyfully to sing its praise even if it had been shown to anyones satisfaction that its presumptions were outlandish; because nothing whatsoever would count as a falsification of their beliefs. Do not buy this book if you sincerely intend to learn something about international politics, because there are much better choices around. Although the author might still be regarded as a fashion icon in his field, all he does is celebrate - under the label of positivism - the ambiguous and dubious as positive in itself. (... 
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 This book does not describe the evolution of consciousness but rather the evolution of unconsciousness.  It describes the work scientists have done in determining the limitations and inaccuracies in consciousness thought.  This is useful in helping frame something as poorly defined as consciousness.  However, mostly you can get this from your Psyc101 text.  The worst is at the end where Ornstein introduces a sort of Sufi mysticism as a substitute for the reason he believes is so flawed.  This is a poor substitute that falls apart at the first rational question, why should I believe this new system which has no evidence for it, as opposed to any other?  You know the book is flawed when a single paragraph he quotes from William James "Varieties of the Religious Experience" has more insight than the rest of the book.  Readers who are interested in what Ornstein is trying to commmunicate are better served by reading William James 
 Okay, I'll admit that by the time I got around to reading Winter's Tale, the book was already suffering from a fatal dose of overhype; I must have heard twenty or thirty fairly literate people wax rhapsodical about the thing over the years, several of whom claimed that it was the greatest book they had ever read.  Still, hearing rave reviews of Shakespeare, Dickens, Ellison, Grass, Vonnegut, Hemingway, etc. never stopped me from appreciating genius when I experienced it for myself.  Helprin, while clearly a gifted writer (a phrase that most reviewers use to describe him), is no genius, and the best thing I can say about Winter's Tale is that I get the sense that it took him a long time to write it.  The main problem for me is that the lengthy descriptive passages always feel overwrought and pretentious, like a hammy performance by an otherwise talented actor.  I dislike being aware of the writing process while I am actually reading someone's work, and Helprin never lets me forget that I am in smack dab in the middle of a book that insists it is a magnum opus--that is an unpardonable sin, as far as I am concerned.  Gunter Grass, whose genius I mention above, somehow manages to convince me that all his outrageous stylization is actually some sort of stream of consciousness, and via translation, no less.  Shakespeare is famous for making blank verse sound like natural dialogue.  Helprin, as his admirers are fond of pointing out, is intoxicated with language, but whatever his skills, he isn't capable of passing that intoxication along to all of his readers. Hey, I love energetic verbal ingenuity as much as anyone I know, but I am not a language whore.  So, while I do acknowledge that Winter's Tale is capable of captivating a huge audience, it nevertheless lacks the universality that I expected it to possess based on its reputation.  And, after reading some of the other reviews here, I can see that I am not alone.  If I had to rate it strictly on my own appreciation of its merits, I would give Winter's Tale a half of a star.  That I give it two stars is merely my acknowledgement of the fact that appreciating fiction is largely a matter of taste.  But true literary genius is not 
 This may be a bit of spoiler but I was completly dissappointed in the end of this book/trilogy.  I could not understand how she was going to wrap up so many story lines in last few pages of the book and then I learned.  I felt I was reading the end of a story witten by a parent trying to rush their children to bed.  After three books I had invested a great deal of time into these characters and story lines.  To wrap them up so hasty, with such outragouse coincidence and neatness did not do justice to what otherwise was a very thoughtful series of books.   
 After souring to dizzying heights with their first four albums (a feat achieved by only a handful of bands) the inevitable fall seems to have come on this disc. The Bunnymen built their reputation on moody, psychedelic concept pieces that culminated in Ocean Rain. For this release the band moves into more 'mainstream' territory, eschewing album-wide cohesiveness for a more radio friendly approach. Unfortunately these lightweight songs don't work as well as the tantalizingly obscure sound they abandoned. If you're new to the Bunnymen you're probably better served by checking out their first four albums (Crocodiles, Heaven Up Here, Porcupine and Ocean Rain) or skipping forward to their more recent efforts Evergreen and Flowers 
 This has to be one of the most boring books I've ever read. Follow this book, and you'll end up waiting tables in no time. The film festival guide by Chris Gore is a much better, more informative read. Avoid this  snoozefest 
 Disney keeps goming out with sequels to the best DVD's ever made.The  Jungle Book Limited Issue Is the best movie ever made.My Grandson watches it all the time. Its made for  the child also the adult like me. I bought  Jungle Book 2 totally dissapointed in the dvd.  I did not like it at all I returned it.Its a horible movie for children:  Disney stop ruining our excellent dvds.I give this dvd A - 
 Abid Ullah Jan 's ridiculous insinuation in this intellectually bankrupt dissertation is that western democracy is a failure and it should be replaced by islamic rule,perhaps such as found in the Islamic Republic of Iran or the Taliban.     It is hard to get through this book without pondering whether the author has even an inkling of knowledge on how democracy works.After toiling through the first half of the book it becomes rather obvious that the book is promoting a political agenda akin to the typical islamic fundamentalist assault on western values and societies.     'The End of Democracy'  is filled with bias, twisted facts and erroneous conclusions that sadly are the usual fare of contemporary islamic thinking these days. The narrowness of Abid Ullah Jan's interpretation of world events and history is not convincing at all and the the assertions he makes are pure nonsense. His assertion that Islamic rule is superior to Democracy in the areas of justice , civil rights and civil liberties may sound good on paper, but anyone who lives in the real world can clearly see that this is patently false.     Evidently the great arab thinkers of the distant past seem to have all been replaced by narrow minded islamic propagandist such as Abid Ullah Jan whose lives seems dedicated to discrediting western societies and promoting islamic radicalism 
 I honestly do not understand what all the hype is about.  I forced myself to read this book because all I had ever heard was how it was one of the best and most influential pieces of modern literature, but eight hours a day of manual labor would be a less tiresome task then trudging through this pile of rubbish. In all honesty, the plot is entertaining, if you can find it.  I am sure the Cliffs Notes of the LOTR are interesting and entertaining, but why anyone would want to torture themselves reading this collection is beyond me.   I read one chapter a night until I was done, and that was too grueling a task.  I constantly found my mind wondering and having to reread every page because it could not hold my attention.   You don't have to believe the hype.  This collection of books is really, really terrible and boring, and I wouldn't wish the task of reading in on my worst enemy 
 It's quite amusing listening to Western audiences view this film as some sort of factual documentary on Iranian culture.  A dramatized production, based on a one-sided book which in itself is dramatized with inconsistencies.  This must be what passes for cultural education these days.    I suppose the Westerners whom have gone to Iran and come back speaking of beauty and the warmth of the people obviously are suffering from a delusional disorder.  And the ones whom probably haven't stepped foot outside of their own backyard and rely on the news and Hollywood movies as their cultural guides are the authority.    These are the same people who believe the president of Iran stated "Israel will be wiped off the map".  With a little research, they would see that this was a gross dramatization, aimed towards the truly naive.  But maybe those people don't care for the truth.  I guess it's true what they say; Ignorance is bliss 
 3D Home Architect is a complete crock. I have attempted to use it many times. After hours of reading and playing with it I am still unable to perform the most simple task. I own V1.3 of this software and it outperforms the current version by light years. I also spent lots of time trading emails with Broderbund in an attempt to obtain either additional product support or a refund and I got nothing. So henceforth they will not see another dime of my hard earned $. Sorry 
 Listened to the audiobook version of this James Patterson novel in the car -- simply because my spouse bought it off a remainder table cheap and I figured we should get our money's worth.  Twenty minutes into it I wanted to chuck the first tape out the window the writing (and the audiobook narration) was so overwrought.  But then I listened longer as I realized how amusing the bad writing was.  A wonderful text here for a creative writing class:  how to write junk fiction that sells but which you'd never want to put your name on.  Sad that someone can write as poorly as Patterson and sell oh so many books 
 I agree with the previous reviewer: this recording contains about three minutes of musical bliss.  The rest of it is self-conscious and belabored 
 I simply do not see any point in mixing Crime Fiction with Crime and Punishment.   
 I would not recommend this globe.  I bought this for my 3rd grader and on the first day of using it, the equator peeled off!!  I thought of keeping it anyway but decided to deal with the hassle and plan on returning it.  It also feels too flimsy and can fall over easily 
 Don't buy this book, please! The man is a complete fake. He's degrees are totally worthless. He is making money off of people looking for help and tricked into believing his marketing hype. Just do some research on Google and you'll discover the truth about him 
 I feel sorry for the author. I do not know enough about the industry to know if this is very bad writing or catastrophically bad editing, but under all this lies quite an interesting book.  As others have pointed out the book starts with frequent editing errors, where the spacing is wrong (somewhat lik ethis). This happens every other page for about the first 25 pages, but then seems to stop.  Even worse are smaller, stranger errors that remind me of my student papers before I reviewed them.  For example in discussing John Law he makes a very interesting introduction, until he mistakenly refers to him at one point in the text as William Law (he had discussed a William Peterson right before). I find this sort of error inexcusable in a published book, and once I lose respect for the work it becomes truly hard to enjoy it.   I also believe this form of mistake has motivated most of the bad reviews, even those which mention flaws in economic theory.  For example one reviewer critiqued the comparative advantage example (I presume it is the one where two men work in a deserted island); it is indeed very poorly phrased, but it is an example of comparative advantage. However, after all the previous mistakes who cares to read carefully that which was not written carefully 
 I am writing this over a year after actually seeing CUBE 2: HYPERCUBE, because it was the first time I could stomach to remember it.  I am a hard core indie-scifi freak (well any good scifi really) and I must say this movie was a train wreck.  I couldn't believe the film makers sheer lack of understanding as to what made the original CUBE great- all white rooms, street clothes, time traveling canabal, I'm saying.  I considered CUBE to be up there with the greats (Donnie Darko, Dark City, blah blah blah), CUBE 2 just cheapened it.  If you really need more Cubedom see CUBE ZERO the prequel tney recently made, it's at least decent.  But to this monstrousity just say no 
 This gorgeously filmed French movie is aiming to be a glamorous WWII melodrama. And if it wasn't for the empty-headed plot, this might be a enjoyable film. But BON VOYAGE is trying so hard to be a wartime farce, it ends up just a hollow pastiche. (And didn't Hogan's Heroes teach us that wartime farces are generally a bad idea?)  The actors do their best with the silly storyline (which involves a LOT of rushing about from one locale to another, with lots of foot chases along the way), but it's mostly for naught.  Particularly disappointing is Isabelle Adjani, who, despite her many, many scenes, fails to register as either a comedienne or dramatic actress in this role 
 Okay, let's start here:  I rented the audiobook version of Pat Conroy's Beach Music to listen to at work and, while some people hated it, I didn't exactly find it as lovable as other reviewers.    Our scenario?  Jack McCall runs away to Rome with his two year-old daughter Leah after his wife Shyla commits suicide, and the book appears to be a story of how he reconciles himself to his estranged family after 5 years abroad before one day being contacted that his mother is dying of leukemia.    I loved his details of Rome and the intrigue surrounding his former hippie friend turned priest, but what did the stories of Vietnam have to do with his wife's death?  That's when you realize, unlike some other viewers here, that this is just not the story of a man coming to terms with the loss of his wife and why, but it is the healing of friends and family who have been separated and hurting for so long.  The trouble with the story is that a lot of it is untidy and senseless, making for an unpleasantly long saga with unsatisfying and unrealistic resolve.  This seems to be a novel that Conroy wrote as if he were a pizzaria boss:  he wanted to write a book that had the works, regardless if it all went down well or not.  Okay, I bought his story up to a point, namely that I loved the portrayal of mother Lucy who rose impressively above her terrible childhood and earned the respect of the Waterford locals.  I even learned to like turtles because of this character.  Unfortunately, Lucy was the only character I liked in this book.  Outside of very good and disturbing portraits of Shyla's parents' experiences with the haulocost, what was realistic about this 8-part Lifetime miniseries?  The entire two weeks lost at sea story had nothing to do with the rest of the book, and the radical 60s passages were so cliche' and worn out that I just had to laugh.  John Harden wasn't so much a paranoid schitzophrenic as he was milking it to death, and I stopped tolerating Jack after he made the crack that Vietnam vets were the biggest crybabies in the world.  Oh, really a**hole?  I think that can be said of all the radicals out there!  I hated Shyla, and couldn't understand why anybody loved that John Harden in a dress:  "Oh, the Lady of the Coins is calling me, Jack.  I must go now, but you can get married again.  I'm selfish enough to kill myself, but I also demand that you put me before anybody else, and we'll dance under the water when you die."  That stupid letter didn't even make me cry.  What is this anyway, Titanic?    Worst crime?  A 6 year-old child who is more grown up than the adults.  Yes, Leah McCall.  She understands schitzophrenics, knows what a woman wants, and gives out dating advice for the middle aged lovelorn.  This child is a new messiah and poops diamonds out of her butt.  All hail the mighty, wondrous, and most unbelievable Leah McCall and her great dog Chippie!  Sorry, but if this is considered a great Conroy work, I must be in trouble.  Truthfully, I've read worse, but the flowery prose only added to the painfulness of this already credulity lacking waste of four days.  In all fairness, I'll say that this was my first Conroy book and, because I wasn't bored for long periods of time, another one isn't out of the question.  I just hope it's not this disjointed.    
 This show, as a CD at least, is generic Andrew Loyd Webber with no real high points. It's not bad but as other reviewers have mentioned it's pretty darn familar. I don't have strong feelings about ALW. Most people seem to love or hate him. It seems to me that with the exception of the arguably great EVITA, he's better at coming up with some achingly beautiful songs than completely successful musicals.  The most important point I have to make, however, is that the source material for this show is really first-rate. The Victorian Wilkie Collins was the inventor of the mystery novel and a great suspense novelist. It would be a shame to ruin the suprises in THE WOMAN IN WHITE by listening to this cd before reading the book. It's almost a masterpiece; the musical is just so-so.  One crucial warning, however. Because Collins is now regarded as Literature, the back covers of all his novels and the  introductions and prefaces to them MUST NOT BE READ before you read the novels themselves. A key twist that happens on about page 400 of the 500-page MAN AND WIFE is REVEALED ON THE BACK OF ONE EDITION. The first 100 pages of my personal favorite Collins novel, NO NAME, are enjoyable but not earth-shaking. Then BAM! out of the blue all the pieces fall into place and the book becomes a rollercoaster -- hundreds of pages of almost uninterupted thrills. If you read the back cover in advance  you'll know more or less where the first hundred pages are leading.  Okay, maybe all of the above doesn't belong in a review of this CD -- but you really should give Collins a try. (His later work -- post-1870 -- gets pretty uneven so don't start with that.)  Lastly, David Zippel's lyrics are a real disappointment. By and large they're just passable -- pretty close to the mediocre Don Black. Zippel is usually better 
 I picked up this book at the local library because the title and brief description on the cover sounded interesting. I started reading the book and was amazed at how poorly written it was. Typos, bad logic, and a general tone of delivery that made it difficult to continue reading. Later, I skimmed the remainder of the book to make sure I wasn't jumping to conclusions. This book is very bad. I was curious to see what other readers thought of the book on Amazon -- I can only guess that some of these five star reviews are from the author's friends 
 I bought these disks investing money and trust into the sony name, I am sorely dissapointed in this purchase, one out of every 4 or 5 disks actually shows up as a disk to be burned, meaning that while I spent money on a 50 pack, I actually got a 10 or 15 pack. Absolute trash, DO NOT BUY THIS 
 This is the first in the Shopaholic series. Rebecca Bloomwood has a very serious problem. She can't stop shopping. She has crazy money issues, and literally just hides her bills in a drawer and goes and shops more to make herself feel better. This novel takes place in Britain, where Bex (her nickname) spends all of her money earned as a financial journalist on the latest designer clothes. PS she knows nothing about finance, which adds humor as she bumbles her way through the work day in order to attend another press meeting that serves free champagne. The irony of her job and compulsion are cute, and Bex really means well, but honestly, can't you just cut up the credit card? How hard is it to not buy more sweaters? I'd only recommend this book if you're a big shopper, because that's the fun part. Otherwise, it's hard to like Rebecca because she comes across as irresponsible, endlessly without any willpower, and materialistic as they come. That said, I still must confess that I also read Shopaholic Ties the Knot and Shopaholic & Sister 
 Had problem with unit w/in 3 mos of purchase. Was finally able to make contact with company after several WEEKS of trying. Even their customer support line disconnects you when you try to keep holding and don't leave a message. And when you leave a message, it must be deleted, because they don't return calls.   Product was replaced w/ refurb unit missing parts. Now I can't get ANYONE!   Altec Lansing is a poster child for extremely poor customer service. They have your money, and you have, well, a product with their name on it, for as long as it works. Had I known this prior to purchase, I wouldn't have purchased. It's that simple 
 I've never heard this album. who are the eurythmics 
 These noisemakers are too big and hard for my one year old, she bonks herself with them. My toddler and preschooler are not particularly interested in them. They make fairly interesting noises, but are awkward to hold and shake and are somewhat heavy for their size. No one really plays with them much. I would not recommend them. 
 I WANT THE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK! After all the talk about what a cult classic this film is! What a waste of time! Maybe this movie was a novelty to American moviegoers in 1973. That time is past (even then, the "robots attack people" concept was hardly new). Now this is just a boring B movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action. This film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes. Unless you are doing a research paper on American Sci-fi cinema, or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid, or you just like boring anticlimactic B movies, AVOID THIS DULL PIECE OF DRIVEL. I FEEL CHEATED!     
 I have had a major problem with this dock. Which is that I can't get it to work with any firewire cable except the one supplied with it. I've tried several cables (that I've tested and I know for certain work) but none will work. I can get power (the blue light goes on) but I can't get the iPod (60 gig 4th gen photo) to show up in the itunes window or in the mac finder (I haven't  tried it with windows). This problem is perplexing because I don't see any difference physically in the 6 pin firewire cable supplied with this dock and the others that I have tried. I've emailed maxell but they have yet to give me an answer to this problem (after one week). There may be a simple answer but I don't have time to make this dock work right. I need to use my ipod so I'm returning it. In short, a word of warning, If you need to connect this dock via firewire and need a cable longer than the two foot one supplied with it, you may be out of luck 
 I'm new to this type of book but the first I read was Lee Child's "The Hard Way" featuring his loner hero Jack Reacher and after that this book was an incredible let down.  Implausible plotting and idiot characters was my main problem.  This is set in rural Georgia and I didn't buy it.  Seriously- one of the main protaganists has been raped by a jesus freak, her twin sister was killed and she was being abused  by her ex-skinhead boyfriend and she had an abortion.  She's also a police detective.  Yeah- dopey 
 The author had a BRILLIANT idea writing this book, however she couldn't accomplish and develop a chain of reasoning. She is PROLIX and way too boring. The reading has to be dragged.   This is not a book, this is her personal JOURNAL, which I suppose it's much easier to write than a book.  She vomits words and texts in these pages, and the reader has to SCAN through them, trying to find something worthy to read. You can spot very FEW interesting things about her experience. It's exausting, like trying to find a needle in a haystack.   She couldn't organize her experiences and consequent feeling into wise words. So, if you plan to buy this book to get some advice from the author, just drop it! She won't help you at all. She is just gonna give you obvious phrases like "I comtemplated the nirvana and longed for Zoloft". Give me a break!!!   Be wise, and NOT BUYING THIS BOOK will be the right choice. Because, buying is all about choices 
 I wasn't as fond of this book as I was others by Hoag.  In my opinion the mystery part of it was soft, and the love story wasn't that great either.    The basic story is the heroine is a counselor for runaway girls.  They move to a new 'house' and one of the residents in the neighborhood organizes a group to protest.  The neighbors feel that the home will ruin their nice safe neighborhood.  Things start going wrong in the neighborhood and, of course, the teens are blamed.  Mixed in along with this is the 'romance' between the counselor and the senator who is there in an attempt to save the home.  The counselor, Lynn, thinks that the senator is there just to get camera time and the senator is frustrated by Lynn's repeated efforts to push him away because of her past experiences.  I guess my main problem with the book is it lacked the spark that most of Hoag's other books have.  It wasn't horrible, but it was by no means my favorite by Hoag.  I would definitely recommend some of her newer books over this, try Mercy for example.  Whichever book you end up picking, I hope you enjoy it :) 
 I have to say that I am a fan of Bill Murray's acting (over and beyond his comedic work), and I think that Rushmore and Lost in Translation were efforts that should secure him in the canon of great actors, but this film felt very misguided and took an awful turn at some point.  Murray's soulful, silent stare was way too overused here, cheapening the times he used it quite well in other movies, and after he parts from his neighbor, who is a wonderful character and helped balance out Murray's doleful depression, the film just seems to bottom out and never seems to rise again.  Jarmusch has had much success in the past in following very quiet, interior characters (_Dead Man_, _Ghost Dog_), but here he either overplayed his hand or forgot that what really made those other films work was counterbalance.  Nobody and the French ice cream man are excellent counterweights in the other films to keep things from getting too dragged down, but in this movie, the counterweight is cut away from way too early, and this film suffers for that mistake. 
 I bought these at a local store, but I took them back, because when you wear them, there is a strap that hugs tightly to your head and actually presses down against your head considerably. This is uncomfortable and would really suck for someone like me, since I'm prone to getting headaches. I didn't even bother seeing how well these headphones worked, because even if they worked perfectly, I wouldn't have wanted to keep them 
 Very poor book, realy a waste of time. The review below said it all 
 I'm criticizing Carver with the utmost deference, because I hold the man in the highest regard and strive to write like him.  I can't say enough good things about his short stories (My favorite is A Small, Good Thing), which manage to say so much with so few pages.  His poems, however, are not as good as his short stories.  They lack the continuity of his stories, as well as the practiced craft of more experienced poets.  The line changes seem awkward, and there is not a consistent theme in each sub-collection.  These poems are not meant to be read by poetry afficionados, but by precocious teenagers who need a little encouragement to start writing for themselves.  Carver's stories should be required reading for any human being, but if you like to read poems about the same themes, check out Carl Dennis or Tony Hoagland 
 I have the Penguin translation of the Epic, and I enjoy it very much. I picked up this book to get a more recent translation. I can't question the accuracy of the translation, since I'm not an expert but, from a literary standpoint, I found this translation lacking.  First, the tone shifts for no apparent reason.  In some sections the characters speak like they're orating and then, all of a sudden, the language is peppered with slang.    Second, I find it inappropriate for translators to insert Christian mythological terms in ancient texts.  For instance, this book calls the underworld "hell." While the Mesopotamian afterlife was hardly a keg party, to equate it with the Christian hell is simply inaccurate.  Finally, and most important, the translation fails to capture any sense of the power of the original.  The language is dry.  The structure of the sentences is stiff and the pacing is dull.  Perhaps that's because this translation is academic in nature?  Whatever the reason, the Epic won't continue to enthrall people for another several thousand years with translations like this.    As a side note: I didn't find the critical essays particularly interesting, so the book didn't work for me that way either.  I'd pick the Penguin translation over this one in a heartbeat 
 The concept of this book intrigued me: analysis of the first really postmodern president America had, a man who was known for scanning the polls before he had an opinion on any issue, and a candidate whose success was made possible by computer analysis of voter opinion. However, the work itself is quite tedious. There is not enough analysis of characters, and too many scenes explaining the political process. There is too much emphasis on the development of a plot that's tangential to the study of tehse characters, and there is not enough room given to them so that, in breathing, they might exhale what we can then diagnose. I didn't understand why so much emphasis was placed on the narrator, either, since his role was not central. While I read this book without political bias, I was not blown away by its quality as a read or a political novel, but the insight into a certain president's character, and how that made him a success, was intriguing. Not sure if I'd recommend it to anyone except historians at this point 
 Suzanne Somers apparently has no use for modern medical science. Especially as a survivor of breast cancer (although of a very early stage) she is putting her life in grave danger by taking hormones. Recent studies have shown that women who were taking HRT for protection from heart problems actually had MORE problems than normal menopausal women. This is an unbelievably destructive, horribly dangerous book for people to take seriously. Being skinny is NOT more important than being alive. If you want to get the real scoop on hormones, talk to a doctor at an academic medical center (in other words, one that isn't going to mislead the public for personal financial gain) and see what she or he has to say. Chances are excellent that you'll be told to avoid them at all cost. Look at it this way: are you going to put your very life in the hands of Suzanne Somers? I'm sure she's a very nice person; it's just that she has no medical training whatsoever. *** writing from an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center** 
 The first two or three tracks are good but the supporting instrumentals and vocals are poor.  The supporting instrumental on track 6 was so bad I thought the cd had a defect.  In other places, the supporting music is  barely audible.  The only singing occurs on track 12.  I would recommend  getting the cd "Picture This".  It's much better 
 Very disappointing. Far too much detail on the history of climbs and climbers.    Good detail on the approaches to the trailheads. BUT, the actual details on the trails themselves, the most important part, are sadly  lacking in information    Never a mention of the length of the trails nor  the elevation gain. Insufficient landmarks noted and very vague on compass  bearing or other vital information such as water availabilty, good camping  spots, etc.    Good points are the trails noted on the photos of the  mountains and the mile-by-mile directions to the trailheads. All the more  disappointing that no distances noted for the trails themselves or even how  long one might expect to be on one 
 The idea is good. The characters are really good, with a few exceptions. BUT.   1) This book's plot is extremely repetetive. "Oh my gosh, she's committed the unpardonable; they have not choice but to curse her with death." OVER and OVER again. Ayla breaking the "most sacred-est rule ever" and then mysteriously NOT getting in serious trouble for it consumes the entire plot. Well, not the entire plot. The other 1/4 involves how Brun likes his son, now he doesn't, now he does. Ad nauseum.  2) In addition to the repetitious plot, there is so much redundant text that one must wonder if ANYONE read the manuscript before it went to print. The author will write, for instance, about how the Clan was confused by Ayla's tears (since they don't cry), and then 10 pages later, she writes the same thing. I don't know how many times she wrote about Ayla's tears, Brun's worry about Broud, how intercourse is strictly a natural function, how they think she's ugly. Etc. Etc. (Etc. Etc.)  3. The "Be sure and purchase the next installment" ending in infuriating.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I see now why there are 5 copies of it in every used book store. That said, I read the whole thing in 5 days, so that must say something good about it 
 The Left Behind series is the best reading I have ever read. I admit my reading is not all that much, but when I read the very first book I was hooked, I read all twelve books in about six weeks. They lead me to understand the Bible better. Thank you Tim and Jerry for such great books.       Corrine Robinson    
 Samantha seems a lot like Becky.  A young woman whose life is very out of balance and doesn't know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions.  Instead of staying at the firm and working out her "mistake," she runs away.  This is just like Becky hiding her bills.  And then she gets a totally implausible job, because she can't tell the truth - again like Becky.  Samantha doesn't tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to.  I agree that the firm would never have taken her back; they probably would have viewed her as a former lawyer who had a nervous breakdown and was in need of psychiatric care.  Samatha, like Becky at times, seems somewhat manic, in that she's frantic somtimes and makes major life decisions on impulse in a state of agitation.  just like Becky when she rushes after her sister on a hike for which she is totally unprepared.  Lithium, anyone?  I don't have an opinion on the housewife/lawyer "controversy," but I do think Kinsella's protagonists need to grow up 
 This is not a pleasent book to read for people who really love cats. It is very depressing and not uplifting at all. I ordered this book, thinking I was going to get a cute cat book with fun stories about cats. Boy, was I  ever wrong. The stories are so dismal and depressing, they are all about  cats & kittens getting killed or dying from one reason or another. The  author even tells us a story about how she "had" to kill some new  born kittens, because she thought the mother cat was to weak to nurse them.  Well, she could have gone to the vet and got some formula and a dropper and  feed them herself. She shouldn't even be a cat owner, she doesn't even know  how to take Good care of cats. Also the author refers to her cats just as  black cat and gray cat. My cats are members of my family, they are my  children, and I gave them names. I don't refer to them as: orange cat, or  black and white cat, or tabby cat, etc. This book is just awful 
 This book fails both as a history or analysis of Yugoslav politics or as a critical biography of Tito. The first few chapters, which contain an overly compressed "historical" review of the South Slavs from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century, contain factual, spelling and interpretative errors so obtrusive and atrocious that they are almost laughable. For example, West claims that the leader of the 1573 Croat peasant revolt was "Donja Stubica" - that was actually the name of the village in which it started. He claims that in 1871 the Croat revolutionary Eugen Kvaternik led an "armed assault on the Serbs," when in fact Kvaternik launched a foolishly bold uprising against the Habsburg Monarchy while many of his fellow rebels were themselves Serbs. He persistently misspells the surname of the great Serbian linguist and writer Vuk Karadzic as `Karadjic' - and there are literally dozens of similar mistakes that riddle the entire text. West basically argues that the problems in Yugoslavia are directly tied to historical events and religious schisms that occurred during the Middle Ages, and reduces the wars which ensued after Yugoslavia's collapse to religious conflicts. He also insists that there are no national nor even ethnic differences between the Serbs, Croats or Bosnian Muslims; rather, he says they are all the same ethnic group with three different religions, thus demonstrating his glaring ignorance of the differences between `nation' and `ethnicity,' among other things. He focuses extensive attention and invective, perhaps rightfully, to the WW2 Croatian Ustasha regime and the often scurrilous role of the Croatian Catholic Church during this period. On the other hand, he downplays or denies the much less extensive but often quite brutal crimes of the Serbian Chetniks during the same period - even to the point of making the ludicrous claim that the Serbian Orthodox Church was "never clearly associated with Great Serb nationalism or with the Chetniks." One of the main flaws of this book is that its primary focus is on World War II - the implication being that this period crucially influenced events in the 1990s. This is only true to a certain extent, but oversimplifies and greatly downplays the even more vital 40+ ensuing years. In fact, at times this book rather eerily resembles texts often seen in Croatian and Serbian newspapers during the late 1980s and early 1990s which speak of events from 50, 150 or even 500 years ago as though they happened yesterday. West's ignorance and lack of objectivity also leads him to (rather outrageously) twice refer to the Kosovo Albanians as `Shiptars' - among non-Albanians, this is a racial epithet, not a neutral descriptive term. Tito, the central figure in this book, fares little better. Although West has a nostalgically favorable view of Tito, he offers no new insights into Yugoslavia's long-time president and strongman, only the reworded observations and conclusions from other biographies, memoirs and histories, both favorable and critical. Often he provides details on completely trivial matters from Tito's life, at one point even citing actor Richard Burton's impressions of Tito and his wife. Aside from a few mildly engaging anecdotes taken from his own travels in Yugoslavia, there is little of interest here. Reading West's book is a colossal waste of time; my recommendation is for readers to check it out of a library, peruse the photographs and then go straight to the bibliography to find more worthwhile books to read on Tito, WW2 and the Ustasha terror and the former Yugoslavia in general 
 Robin Williams used to tell a joke about his son, saying that whenever he got angry with him his son would say 'you hit me and I'll write a book.' I'd like to tell you that there is some deeper meaning behind Peggy Salinger's memior about life with her father, but it seems to more or less boil down to that same idea. Although there are some interesting revelations about Salinger as a man, his daughter doesn't seem to appreciate that many of the problems she faced in her youth were not neccessarily unique to being the daughter of JD Salinger, they're the problems that children of divorce and children who live in rural areas face everyday. There's a lot of blame thrown around here, and not a whole lot of admitting to one's own mistakes. Although this is probably to be expected, it's still frustrating, since Margaret Salinger has more or less made a career out of trading on her father's good name, and since many of her chief complaints about her famous father are largely hypocritical. (Complaining about your father's desire for privacy but refusing to mention the name of your first husband was probably a bad idea.) I admit that her father is probably not as nice a guy as you think he would be, but this is not really a revelation, nor should it affect your feelings about his work. I wouldn't recommend reading it unless your working on a thesis of some sort 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 Finkelstein is a well-known contributor to the Middle East, but not a respected one.    At one point he cites the Arab population of 'Palestine' in the year 1860 as 1.1 million.  Yet, in 1947, the 'high estimate' of the population was perhaps 1 million. Between 1900 and 1937 it is known that the Arab population tripled (see Peel report of 1937, 'Rape of Palestine', etc.).   The 1st number 'proves' Palestine was not underpopulated in 1860 (that shows the Israelis displaced/colonized) and the 2nd inflates the Arab migration from the 1948 war to a number greater than indicated in the 1951 UN report (illustrating the brutality and overall badness of the Israelis).  Inconsistant use of numbers is only one example of the dishonesty of Finkelstein.  The numerous massacres of Israelis by the Arabs in the 1948 war are ignored in favor of dramatizing the one Israeli massacre (Deir Yassin). There are photos available (not in this book)showing Arab 'soldiers' in 1948 with their necklaces ofIsraeli ears, noses, and thumbs around their necks.   The Arab aggression in 1967 is disputed by claims that the battalions of Egyptian armies massed at Israel's border were not sufficient to destroy Israel. The tanks and armies of Syria and Jordan are not considered in this argument. The public statements and actual schedule for this war promising to destroy Israel and the Israelis by all three nations are also not noted.   The offer of the US government to 'protect' Israel (making self-defense unnecessary) in 1967 is emphasized, but the offer was never made by President Johnson, only a congressman without authority to back it up.  In addition,the same promise made by France by DeGaulle in 1956 and repudiated by the same DeGaulle in May of 1967 is not mentioned as a possible source of Israeli unease.   The main interest of the book is the rebuttal to Joan Peter's 'From Time Immemorial'.  One theme of Peter's book is that there was tremendous Arab immigration into the British controlled Palestine from 1920-1945.  Finkelstein attacks her poor scholarly technique and her data.  (I disagree with Finkelstein's conclusions. There are many other sources printed in the 1930's not mentioned by either Peters or Finkelstein that back up the idea of massive Arab immigration into Israel/Palestine. Based on other data published in the 1930's, it is difficult to maintain that the Arab population of Palestine did not triple during this period.)  The other themes of Peters, Arab racism against Jewish Arabs, Arab crimes against humanity perpetrated against their Jewish brethren every century since the birth of Mohammed, that the 'Golden Age' of Arab toleance is largely a myth, are not seriously touched by Finkelstein. (That Arab tolerance of Jews at any time other than 50 years of the Taif states is a myth is well-supported elsewhere.    I am still shocked that Arab apologists continue to cite the Jewish leader and scholar Maimonides as an example of Arab tolerance. (Maimonides twice fled religious persecution from Muslims and, a third time, was on trial for apostasy from Islam and was protected in this trial by the great Saladin. (Saladin appointed his uncle the judge and gave instructions for a 'not guilty' verdict.)  My name is Andrew Nitzberg.  I am Jewish, have a masters degree in history (Medieval Studies), and am a practicing attorney 
 Watson and Crick pilfered the data of Rosalind Franklin (unbeknownst to her) and her data then led them to their ultimate discovery of the double-helix nature of DNA. Instead of acknowledging her with praise, Watson goes on to belittle her and cast her in dark tones without understanding the context in which she was working (ie, a woman working in male-dominated science n the 1950's) -- a classic case of reaction formation. Maybe a brilliant man but with poor insight into human relationships 
 I thought this book would be more representative of the sensationalist reporting the media has been shoving down the throats of Americans for the last few years.  Instead, this book essentially says there is not enough of this over-sensationalized baloney, and it begs that the media produce more in the name of our founding fathers.  If you dare to go there, check this out from the library.  This drivel is not worth your hard earned money 
 what a sad ending to robert pollards ever revolving band, this again is only for the diehards who want every single piece of merchandise that gbv has to offer, i jumped on the bandwagon with the release of ''propeller''way back when, but jumped off after the horrid ''isolation drills'' this dvd contains many good songs but they are just horribly played and bob's singing was disgusting, not a proper way to go out if you ask me but again, the material they were releasing near their end was bland and uninspirin 
 Ansay gives us an anguished portrait of families trapped in a cycle of violence, stifled by religion and small-town culture. Ellen bucks the system by being a working mom, but when her husband loses his job must move in with her in-laws, and is exposed to their vitriol and dark secrets. This book is disturbing on a number of levels, and not for entertainment at all. I found the story extremely realistic but the ending all the more unsatisfying because although Ellen plans to escape, it leaves the guilty unpunished and the scars to her children unhealed. I'd rather have a happy ending,and I finished this book feeling sick. Two stars for gritty realism, but this isn't "light reading" or entertaining at all. Be warne 
 I checked this out because I wanted to take a look at what the new Doctor Who people have been doing in the recent past.  The Second Coming isn't quite as cosmic, but it certainly engages us in some comparable flights of fancy. Steve Baxter (Christopher Eccleston) has an epiphany one night when he's out on the town with some mates. He reckons he's become the Son of God and he proceeds to turn night into day at Maine Road football ground in order to demonstrate his divinely-chosen status (a bit like David Icke, except with powers). His immediate friends take their time to come to terms with this and despite becoming the `new disciples' some of them - notably Judith his girlfriend (Lesley Sharp) - remain sceptical. Through the media he tells the world that they must come up with a `Third Testament'. It later transpires that if they do not, the end of the world will soon follow.  What are this messiah's credentials? Well, he spends forty days in the wilderness which is Saddleworth Moor and he has no earthly father - it turns out that his dad is infertile and couldn't have fathered him. This tickled me. Did writer Russell T. Davis pass his GCSE in Religious Studies, do we think? I couldn't really work out whether the religious symbolism was unconsciously corny and nave or whether it aimed at giving us a laugh. I'd like to think the latter. Steve, curiously, isn't what we might describe as spiritual - certainly not religious. He swears all the time, boozes and although not quite loutish, is somewhat laddish. He's a laddish messiah. His disciples swear at him and he insults them back. (Message to southerners - we in the north are not all like this, despite the plethora of dramas which suggest otherwise: Preston Front, Our Friends in the North, etc. Writers do seem to have this desire to patronise us thus.)  What's noticeable about the founders of the major world religions is that they managed to espouse some degree of religious wisdom. Steve, who just witters nonsensically to the crowds, seems to lack this facility. Is he meant to be devoid of wisdom? Are we asking too much of Russell T. Davis to place some in his mouth? Could he have done so had he wished? Presumably our writer would need to possess some himself! (Jury's out.) It turns out that the party piece belongs to the sceptical girlfriend who clearly becomes the mouthpiece for the programme's message.  So what happens? Despite almost two hours of waiting for Judgement Day, with little action or plot development we eventually come to learn that our messiah is something of a damp squib. He ends up at the girlfriend's home where she feeds him a dish of spaghetti a la rat poison which he takes willingly but not before we discover that he is really just a sort of encapsulation or epitome of human religiosity. Enlightened humanity - Judith - finally comes to realise that she can and must live without him and she spits him out. They argue for a while before atheism wins out and Steve chomps down the poisoned pasta (after the two hours I found myself saying `bon appetit'). So we get the sermon, although it's a secular one which declares the futility of religious belief. But this messiah seemed to me to be almost devoid of any meaningful religious ideas anyway. You can't debunk what doesn't exist. Steve can't be a foil for atheism if he IS a kind of atheism. I suppose that we do end up questioning Russell T Davis's understanding of spirituality, not to say he should necessarily adhere to religion or spirituality, but perhaps to understand it to come degree. And yes, there is a naivety and a corniness which underpins all this third-form philosophy, typical of so many young people working within the arts.   It's a pity that the message of the piece couldn't have been delivered within the actual context of the drama itself. What we have is a two hour TV play followed by a secular sermon, subtext puked out and all. We do have an epilogue, however, where our new-found heroine is hilariously transfigured at the supermarket. I do recommend The Second Coming for amusement, but for enlightenment you'd better have something else to hand. 
 This book is the reason I've read only one John Updike novel. I was so disgusted by the people, the plot, and the very boring and unrelated technical passages that I never read another Updike. I thought the characters were completely unrealistic 
 this cd sucks this band sucks i agree with uber guy they are generic, no let me take that back their super generic i know generic come on i listen to breaking benjamin their generic but not as generic as pulse ultra and another thing the guys voice is to whiny. he need to quit crying when he sings good examples of this are the bands that didnt get hug enough so they sings songs about my girlfriend left,i hate myparents and so on and so forth. i could keep going but i would like to go to sleep so the short and the long of it they suck and bands like them suck buy the good stuff 
 Fresh of the multiplatinum success of Thug Motivation 101, Young Queezy thought he could come back with another album that goes platinum. Fat chance Young Sleezy! Young Skeezy's problem was always one of lyrics not production. As a matter of fact his beats are the reason why people felt him at all. This album fails not only lyrically but beatwise. The only two tracks I can tolerate is I Luv It and the other joint 3A.M. which was produced by Timbaland with Timabaland mumbling on the hook. The rest of this album is pretty much filler. Young Sneezy is an aquired taste that most people will reject after first taste. Definitely the worst album of 2006. Oh yeah I have to respond to that ignorant statement he made on the Monie Love Show about Nas's Hip Hop is Dead. Talking about Nas has no street credibility and he need to see Young Cheezy in the streets. Uhhh Jeezy, Nas doesnt need street crediblity to be dope, he already is dope because he's true to hip hop unlike you and your corny coke rhymes. You need any gimmick you can find to sell and what is so hip hop about you anyway? Using the same words to make a rhyme plus you should be called Birdman Jr because you and him have the same lame things in common. You are not going to do s*** to Nas so you need to take your freak of nature cousin/lover Dumb Joc and get the f*** out of dodge Hoeman!!! 
 I was shocked by the poor quality of the writing from such a well-known author.  Though published in 1995, the reader is expected to ignore the then-well-known realities of DNA testing -- for instance, that shared parentage can be proved by comparing the DNA of siblings, not just from putative sibling to parent.  We're also asked to ignore the realities of fingerprint identification when it would have been immediately helpful in revealing an imposter's criminal record and actual identity.    Adding insult to injury, after ignoring the technique when it logically would have come into play, Sheldon brings in fingerprinting at the very tail of the book, in a complicated scenario involving latent prints to identify not the missing heiress, but rather, a private detective!    Every plot development was telegraphed in advance, and the decedent went from being rather interesting in the first few pages to a one-dimensional (and repetitive) demon throughout the rest of the too-long tome.  Even the vocabulary and sentence structure were overly simplistic.  If you want to read the identical plot but done WELL, try "Amanda" by Kay Hooper, also published in 1995.  Hooper has her character do some marvelously stupid things (again, failing to exploit DNA to the fullest in a timely way), but Hooper's vocabulary, syntax, character development and settings are vastly better than the careless work Sheldon provides in "Morning, Noon, & Night."  I read the books only a week apart.  Hooper's work was engaging, though somewhat predictable; Sheldon's was irritating, and ENTIRELY predictable. 
 I gave this book a low rating, not because it's "offensive," but because it's blah humor.   I am a huge fan of offensive parodies (ex - South Park and Family Guy), but I found this book disappointingly boring. The jokes might be funny to the type of person who laughs at things like outdated Pollock jokes, but most folks would find it to be a major yawn-fest...or just annoying. If I get a funny book, I want to laugh through most of it--not just a random sentence or two on every 50 pages (too much work).   Anyhue, if you want to laugh at pregnancy, better books are "Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads," "My Boys Can Swim" (for the gents) and "Pregnancy Sucks" (for the ladies). They are waaaay more funny AND somewhat educational too (whoa! what a concept).  
 So for the most part, people have been giving this book good reviews.  My personal opinion is that the book is terrible.  Part of the problem with books of this nature is that historians don't understand biology, and biologists don't understand history.  Kelly's major fault lies in his understanding of plague's biology.  He suggests that the Black Death may have been the reason for the increased frequency of the CCR5-delta32 allele deletion.  He cites an article from 1998.  I doubt he read the article nor anything about the topic further.  In the original journal article (Stephens, et al., [1998], Am. J. Hum. Gen., 62:1507-1515), the Swedes, at 14%, have the highest frequency of the deletion with the Chinese as the lowest.  The Black Death struck China too, so why do so few people have the deletion there?  This same problem plagues (pun very much intended) Scott & Duncan's work (Biology of Plagues, 2001; Return of the World's Greatest Serial Killer, 2005).  What Kelly fails to miss is the abundance of research that shows that Y. pestis doesn't interact with the chemokine receptors, which would have caused the elevation of frequency (the CCR5-delta32 allele deletion confers protection against AIDS).  This is just one of many faults in his presentation of Y. pestis as the causative agent of the Black Death.  He also plagarizes; see p. 25 of his work and p. 24 of Herlihy's The Black Death and the Transformation of the West 
 == quote  But, as Nansook Hong reveals in this devastating tell-all account, Sun Myung Moon does not live up to his own teachings. He has frequent affairs, which he rationalizes as "providential", that is, mandated by God.   == end quote   == quote   "My own parents saw no evidence of sexual misconduct when they were each recruited independently to join the church in Seoul."  (In the Shadow of the Moons, pp. 26-27)   == end quote    I know the UM since the mid 1970's and for a quite a long time the only accusation leveled against Rev. Moon was that he was married 4 times (while in fact he is only married 2 times) later those allegations of just being married 4 times was changed to having had sex with female followers.    Chung Hwa Pak, one of Rev. Moon's first disciples, caused considerable controversy by confirming these accusations in a text widely circulated by critics (and later published in Japanese) called The Tragedy of the Six Marys. Pak, who had left the Unification Church, claimed that Rev. Moon practiced during the church's early years sex rituals with, among others, six married female disciples ("the six Marys") who were to have prepared the way for the virgin who would marry him and become the True Mother. The church vehemently denied the allegations. Pak eventually returned to the fold and, shortly before dying, recanted all the accusations in a second text he authored in 1995, called The Apostate.   Similar accusations were discussed earlier in libel cases in Korea and not proved. In 1989, after a ten-year legal case, the Seoul District Criminal Court (79 ko dan 3372) convicted a protestant minister, Rev. Shin Sa-hun, of criminal libel after his accusations of sexual misconduct could not be proved. In another case decided by the Seoul District Civil Court (83 ga hap 3012), damages were paid by Tak Myung-hwan, a well-known critic of the Unification Church, to a woman who had been accused of having an illegitimate son with Rev. Moon and to her son.   Corrections were published by the Christian newspapers Gidok Shinbo on October 8, 1983, and Hanhook Gidok Gongbo, on October 1, 1983, after printing similar accusations of sexual misconduct in the early Unification Church. Part of the retraction stated, "The article 'The Secret Sexual Practices of the Unification Religion' was a repetition of information published during the 1950s, and we have found it to have no basis in fact."  
 This is the first review i've written and I just wanted to let people know that this in essence is a  good book....but only if your looking for drugs/medications as a priority to dealing with your hormonal problems. I ordered this book along with another book called "hormonal balance" and there's no comparing between the two. The other book talks indepth about exactly what your hormones do...and how they control your body. This book gives a short explanation followed by prescriptions that your doctor might advise...it has alternative treatments...but they are not very detailed...and focus more on "get more sleep....exercise....etc". All in all it's not a bad book...but there are definetly better one's out there 
 Not bad. The three feet on the bottom just makes the whole thing unstable and does not help to stabilize the holder. It's ok for the basement or utility room, but if I had to choose again, I wouldn't buy it 
 The description of this publication is poor. It does not tell what volumes are involved in the sale. If you order this you will probable get one published in a date other than the one you ordered 
 Sorry, but I can not recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an agile way of handling schema evolution.  To me the style of writing is boring and in no way adaptable to a real word model.  
    I was really looking forward to this book when I ordered it. It seemed like an interesting peice of litreture. However, I found the writing in it really childish, and I also found myself trying to decipher the odd spellings and grammar in the book.  At the end of the book, I was left wondering what the moral, lesson, or message was. The only thing I really picked up was that it was "okay to be gay", and even that theme didn't shine through strongly. I really felt this book lacked conclusion, as well as a theme.  Though, I do not doubt that this book is fairly true to life... 
 I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I.  Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship.  And the writing isn't so hot, either.  If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad.  The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort 
 At all costs - avoid this book. It is not the fair, well-written analysis of a Rashid  Khalidi, Edward Said, or Vali Nasr. I am so embarassed that I purchased this book on a whim without doing proper research. Coming from someone whom profoundly disagrees with the Zionist movement and the 'Terrorist'-like behavior of Israel, this book is poorly-written, anti-Semitic, and nothing short of propoganda for Neo-Nazis and disillusioned revisionists. 
 I forced myself to finish this book. Like other reviewers have said, the characters are very one-dimensional and contrived. I can see Ms. Berg thinking, "Let's see, I need a character/patient who is rich, one who lives in the ghetto, how about an elderly Jewish couple...." etc. etc. If I read one more cliched remark from the character DeWitt I was going to scream!! I doubt I'll read another one of Berg's books. This one won't stay on my shelf for a second read down the road...off it goes to Goodwill. 
 I wish I had read these reviews before I bought this book!  I am an avid Ann Rule fan - it's hard for me to find a book of hers that I don't already own.  When I saw this one (at Target, no less) I was suprised and bought it right away.  What a disappointment! I already owned 90% of it in other publications, and really felt that I had been scammed into buying something. I rated this with 2 stars, because as always, Ann's writing is superb, and if you aren't an avid follower, this book would be great for you.  But if you've already read most of her work, don't get suckered into buying this 
 I got this as a present for my fiance,thinking it would be a cute funny gift during our pregnancy.However,it got here and neither of us were amused.It's a HORRIBLE book 
 If your body has no problems with insulin insenstitivity and you have terrific will power, then maybe this plan is right for you. but i whole heartedly disagree with his claims that certain foods with high fat content are unhealthy. ie nuts, avocados, fish oil, even butter (gasp!) he also says that eating meat in excess will cause it to rot in your intestines causing your skin and breath to smell! I've never heard of this phenomenon, I refuse to believe it, and physiologically it doesn't make sense. the only reason I gave this book one star is because of his advocation to "whole foods" which are unprocessed. contrary to what one "anti ornish" reviewer said, it's in my opinion that a huge part of the obviously unhealthy average american diet lies in the fact that heavily processed foods are bombarded with partially hydrogenated oils and preservatives. Many people in Europe eat daily by riding their bike to a local market, and preparing food that would otherwise spoil in a day or two. AND THAT IS A GOOD THING! the less a food is injected with man made hormones and chemical preservatives, the better off you are eating it. Long story short, if your protein needs aren't large and you don't have an insulin sensitivity problem, then you may lose fat  and become a bit healthier on this diet. otherwise, just make an effort to eat foods in moderation. it's as simple as that! cut out as much sugar and trans fats as possible. (no one ever needs those and in my opinion they aren't hard to live without.)and don't eat any more than you need to, to reach satiety 
 All sane people agree that The Jam was huge on so many levels. I don't care what anyone else says, The Style Council was Weller's creative apex (most people don't appreciate truly good food either). Wildwood is perhaps the best of Weller's solo material but c'mon, it's a shell of his former brilliance. So much of it is generic and forgettable. I saw him live in LA this summer and it was fine, but the creative well of new material is dry 
 I agree with other reviewers that all the supposedly deep and thought-provoking issues presented in this film (will machines ever think and become self-aware? Will they have emotion? Should they then be considered living beings and have the same rights as humans?) have been done before -- with the character Data on Star Trek, as one of many examples. There is nothing new in this movie.   And it's not done well. The humor is forced ("How does one 'ush'?" asks Andrew. Just hilarious. I thought after 16 years of learning, he would have absorbed common English words). The dramatic moments were anything but (it was supposed to be a big deal when Andrew said "I will..." instead of "One will...". How hard is it program him to say "I" from the beginning? The "One" business was extremely irritating).  In the end, this film was mostly a collection of sci-fi and pseudo-sociology, and it was not saved by Robin Williams' okay -- but hardly great -- performance.  Instead of recycling these old, tired themes, the filmmakers could have addressed a much more real and disturbing question: When robots are built that are capable of performing many tasks currently done by humans (and that day might be approaching with frightening rapidity), how tremendous will the economic and social shockwaves be?  
  . . . that is, if you're tone deaf. SY fans will immediately poo-poo my review for that statement, but let it be a warning to new-bes thinking about purchasing this album because of all the high praise it gets.  I actually like a lot of radical, tripped-out and avant-garde music, such as Faust, Mr. Bungle and Death, for example. And while I'm not exactly a fan, I really do like a fair amount of Sonic Youth, such as the eerie, trippy "Shadow of a Doubt" from EVOL and the epic, extended zone-fest "The Diamond Sea" from WASHING MACHINE along with quite a few of the tracks from their experimental SYR series of EPs.   While I'm well aware that my opinion is way outside the conventional views of Sonic Youth, I still strongly believe that DAYDREAM NATION gets a lot more credit than it deserves, I suspect in part because some people jump on the critical bandwagon in a vain attempt to look cool. I actually think their previous album SISTER is stronger and more paletable. Their major-label debut, GOO, does absolutely nothing for me but I do think there's some cool stuff on their next record, DIRTY, especially "100%" and "Drunken Butterfly."   One could say DAYDREAM NATION "rocks," but it's just so gratingly atonal and annoying, especially when Kim Gordon opens her mouth. To be perfectly honest, most of their music could be described that way. I think their later abums are typically more artistic, more listenable and generally better, but no doubt many fans prefer the alien F-U radicalism of their earlier material.  SY deserves props for their fearless experimentalism and severely art-damaged, strangely tuned, feedback-drenched guitars. But this band has an extremely limited appeal for good reason. Approach with caution.  I'm sure my review of DAYDREAM NATION does not conform to the vast majority of opinions by Sonic Youth fans, but I bet plenty of non-fans would agree. Whatever the case, it's my honest opinion 
 This book contains plenty of misinformation about the Zane family. It may be interesting reading, but it is not an accurate portrayal of the Zane Patriots. Not sure where he got his information but he needs to make many corrections. I've already written Bantam Books concerning this and I await there response 
 Wow, I can not believe that two of the best songs of the film were cut off. 1.- Rock and roll part II ( Gary Glitter) and 2.-Get it on (T. Rex). The rest has been said in the other costumers reviews. 
 More crap from Plimpton, the very definition of athletic supporte 
 it's a good book for people who want to know the simplest method for growing the mushrooms. it's only dedicate to Stropharia cubensis 
 The Scientific Method applied to this book:  1) Form a hypothesis:  Great managers do something differently than mediocre managers. 2) Conduct an experiment:  Interview 80,000 managers. 3) Analyze data: ???this step is missing??? 4) Draw conclusions: Write this Book.  With the exception of the "12 questions", the authors make no attempt to back any their conclusions with the results of their study.  They make several insightful statements, such as "many managers say they would like to define the right outcomes."  However, they do not even attempt to tell the reader how the study led them to this statement.  Did 90% of the managers interviewed state this?  Did 60% of the great managers state this while only 10% of the mediocre managers did?  Does "many managers" mean 100 managers?  100 managers seems like "many managers" at first, but considering 80,000 were interviewed I 100 managers is a negligible amount.  The entire book consists of several rational statements that are not supported by their study.    It seems to me that after conducting a huge study to find out what great managers do differently, the authors found almost no common trends.  However, since they put a lot of money and effort into conducting the study, they needed something to show for it and wrote this book.  If Buckingham and Coffman didn't claim this book was a result of "the largest study of its kind," I would say it offers some decent advice;  however, since it does make this claim, I wish they would have back up their conclusions so the readers would be able to determine how valid they are.   
 Fast, easy, not-too-techincal read.  The Title is misleading.  The book is about race. It is a political screed the basis of which is that racial differences in the U.S. are cultural and not genetic.  The author presents scientific evidence that there is little racial difference in DNA from one race to another to show that all races have more in common than they have differences.  The book moves from science to an attack on Europeans.  According to Graves, Europeans are subjugators of others.  Those Anglo-Saxon males seem to be the worst!  Graves conveniently forgets some non-Europeans who have not done too poorly when it comes to subjugation: Ghenghis Kahn, Mao Tse Dong, Hirohito, and Pol Pot come immediately to mind.  Even some Africans have done their part: Idi Amin, Sani Abacha, Samuel Doe, Charles Taylor and Zimbabwe's own Robert Mugabe, who is now "cleaning out the trash."     
 The fantasy story in this book is delightful, as are the illustrations.  However, the book repeatedly shows a baby riding on a dog. There is no way I'm going to give the idea of riding a dog to my 2-year-old, especially because we have a dog in our household. This book would be better suited for older children who are able to recognize the difference between real and pretend 
 I wanted to see Natalie Portman in what I thought was a real acting role. The only other movies I've seen her in was Leon the Professional (which I thought she was superb in), and Phantom Movie. I fail to see how she was nominated for best supporting actress in this movie. Maybe it was a weak year in female actors? She did a fine job, but I do not believe it was worthy of being nominated.  Now, onto the movie.  This is basically Seinfeld with big name stars. A pointless movie, that was so slow and no plot... I was sleeping through half the movie, and I lost interest after the introduction of Natalie's ("Alice"). Jude Law did the best job in this wretched film.  He pulled off the "loser character, and failed author mentality."  I don't get this movie, or why it was even made, but, I am not into similar movies.  This movie, supposedly about people who lost love, or was in love...no. I don't think so.  There was no love in this movie.  It was lust, pure teen-age hormones running rampant.  All it lacked were true teenagers.   The chemistry lacked between all of the characters, except between the characters and I did not believe in them.  Other than that... For a brief moment, I did believe in Natalie's Alice and Jude's Dan. Oh well. I guess I don't understand this movie at all, but I also didn't care about them. The characters were despicable and annoying (like Seinfeld).  Oh yes, there were many wasted scenes.  Such as, the photo shoots scenes. Who cares?  Why bother showing that?   As funny as the internet "chatting" scene between Dan (Jude Law) and Larry (Clive Owen), it was almost as meaningless.  Certainly, it was far too long.  The producer, director and scriptwriter should be knocked over the head with such a bad movie.  I don't blame any of the actors at all, they tried their best in their limited functions in this garbage. That said, Natalie Portman needs to use her talents and beauty in better roles.  
 I journeyed to the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore to see the exhibition. "MANET - The Still Life Paintings" which is on view until April 22, 2001. The show was previously at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.  It is a lovely, intimate show.  The majority of these gorgeous still lifes of fruits, vegetables and flowers were painted in the last three years of Manet's life. Unfortunately, the catalogue does not begin to do these beautful oil paintings and watercolors justice.  The book's colorplates are of unsatisfactory quality and fail to capture the sumptuousness of these touching works of art.  The book measures just shy of 9 inches by 9 inches, too small to get any partial enjoyment after seeing the exhibition. The text does not advance art scholarship. Not worth the price 
 I had rated this book a "two" in relation to other Koontz books I have read. The book is entertaining enough, but is not very unique in relation to other books that Koontz has written. Koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters. Often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning, but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background. Koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one.   I believe Koontz tries to express certain generalties, some of which have moral and religious undertones:  In the end, good overcomes evil and often evil by its destructive nature, destroys itself.  Love is worth fighting and dieing for.  Love is stronger than evil.  What does not kill you, makes you stronger.  Evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries.  The key to happiness is love, not material gain.   Evil lurks where you least expect it 
 Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed 
 Written a little bit too ironically. I did enjoy the reference to Encyclopedia Brown. Fun for a quick read and perhaps for those who are more enmeshed in the ND world than I 
 The book is theoritical and does not provide new practical ideas. It reads like an implementation methodology book more than a management book 
 Over half of this movie consists of scenes taken  from the original 1939 classic film directed by Zoltan Korda. Even those scenes can't disguise the remake's network TV-movie quality. Beau Bridges is generally a good actor,  but he is terribly miscast on this film. Go rent both versions of The Four  Feathers and see it for yourself 
 I have read Chinese fairy tale books that spark the imagination. Unfortunately this is not one of them. The language is dull and the illustrations are not up to par...I actually fell asleep while reading them several times. This book does a disservice to these tales and hopefully it will not deter others from trying stories from other countries. I bought this book used and it is still not worth the reduced price. The author probably had good intentions but this is one to pass 
 Colorless and high priced, though I bought it at the book store for 88.00.  Sections are laid out poorly, but key words and ideas a pre-highlighted. About the same information given in any material science book, just  different layout 
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 Sometimes, reviewers on Amazon give the reading public a great disservice ... and this is one of those times. I don't know what Preston & Child's game is, but their writing seems aimed at the junior-high crowd. Nothing wrong with that, but it would have been nice if there had been a disclaimer on the cover: "Warning - lame plot, bad writing, juvinile characters ... scratch that - no character development whatsoever 
 DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT BUY ANY PRODUCTS FROM THE WESLO COMPANY. I just received my "Weslo Cadence C44 Treadmill" and have attempted to assemble it. The handrail holes are not drilled in the proper spots so that they may be attached correctly to the console. The Customer Service numbers are all disconnected. Their website gives an additional number to call, and a recorded message tells you to either call the now disconnected numbers, or puts you on hold for about 2 minutes before it hangs up on you. I have wasted an entire afternoon trying to contact them. This company is a complete scam. If you are even considering buying one of their products, your money is better spent getting your head checked 
 I hate this whole idea.  I'm so tired of new agers sitting around doing nothing waiting for someone else to do all the work and save them.  It's pathetic.  I also hate how this author wants to neatly categorize people into tiny little boxes and put one neat little label on them.  Just the idea that an entire generation could be summed up in 1 sentence is insulting to any intelligent human being.  Am I an indigo kid? I don't know.  I'm certainly in the age group and I certainly have a complete lack of respect for authority.  I know who I am.  I also can't stand hypocrisy and people who won't get things done for themselves.  I am exceedingly empathic and can read people like a book, even over the internet.  But I do not have ADD.  I'm not here on some mission as a vanguard for a buncha little kids.  I'm not here to save humanity from anything. Humanity should save itself.  I have patience.   This book is just another example of a broken new ager praying that someone will tell her what to do. 
 We got this play tent as a gift.  It was so hard to put this tent up.  I couldn't do it by myself.  I had to wait for my Husband and we still had problems. The poles that hold up the tent are so long that they are so hard to get into the tent corners- that is what holds the tent up.  The kids did love the tent after we got it up though. They played for hours in it.  The first time we took it down- one of poles snapped in half.  So, now we are returning it 
      The frame seems to be the only thing of any quality on this bike.  I have owned this for three months so far and have had to replace the shifter, derailer, brakes and other small items.  This bike is NOT Schwinn's usual quality.  Very disapointin 
 Fresh Horses, on paper, would have seemed to have been a perfect hit script. You had Molly Ringwald, with her porcelain skin and delicately curly red-blonde hair. You had Andrew McCarthy with his boyish charm but also the male strength beginning to come through. You had a romantic triangle. You had the "class divide". The Brat Pack was loved by millions. How could this fail?   The problem really does seem to come down to the actors themselves. There's very little "energy" at all to this story which is supposedly about passion overcoming logic. Molly is a 16 yr old girl in rural Kentucky. When her stepfather begins fondling her, and her mother does little to help, Molly tries for the only escape she can find - marrying the older bad-man-in-town, Viggo Mortensen. She claims she never slept with Viggo - only used him for escape. Then Viggo's father began fondling her, and now she wants out of this house as well.   To get momentary relief from her homelife, she hangs out at a friend's home, which is a 24 hour party. Here she runs into Andrew. Andrew is a very serious student who has just gotten engaged to his high-class, wealthy girlfriend. The girlfriend rambles on and on about china patterns, having children and living the perfect life. Andrew goes with the flow until he sees Molly - and is instantly in lust. Molly leads him to believe she's 20, single, and interested in him. It takes maybe 3 days before he's sleeping with her. To his credit, he does tell his fiancee promptly, and breaks off the engagement.   You'd think everything was wonderful now, right? However, Andrew learns from friends about Molly's lies. He decides to keep seeing her anyway. However, he doesn't want to introduce her to his family, and has no intention of marrying her. He says he loves her - but his feelings seem to be more related to sex. At one point he even gives her a wad of cash to buy her off.   There's a telling scene near the end when Andrew thinks Molly has been publicly stripped by her husband. Andrew storms off to their house to have a talk with Viggo. Andrew is deliberately rude - laughing at Viggo's artwork and putting him down. But it's Viggo who is the calm one here. When Molly shows up, Viggo points out that Molly's been doing all this lying and scheming so that Andrew would be a Knight in Shining Armor and ride off with her. He asks Andrew - if you're saying I'm not good enough for her - it seems that you think you're too good for her, right? Andrew finds himself agreeing - that he won't take on Molly himself. He wants to get Molly away from Viggo, but then is going to abandon her to her own means. How could he figure that Molly would be better off with nobody at all, vs with Viggo?   Fast forward to a year later, and Molly has in fact found herself a "wealthy college boy" to take care of her and is taking classes again. She's happy, and Andrew is sad. I suppose you have to give them credit for a not-typical Hollywood ending to the story.   The landscapes are often gorgeous, and the various details of high class, low class, city, country are all played nicely against each other. So the problem really comes down to the main actors. Molly and Andrew maybe have gotten too used to playing ensemble roles where each person just has to be a stereotype without a lot of depth. You really get a sense of shallowness when you're watching this movie. Andrew has an entire life including a long-term romance, that he's set in. In just 3 days he's thrown it all away for Molly - but you never get any real sense that he cares about her. Molly was supposedly taking some quite desperate steps to find safety in her life - including seducing and lying to Andrew in order to convince him to rescue her - but she never seems to care much either.   Intriguingly, only 2 people really seem to have depth in this movie. One is Ben Stiller, Andrew's best friend. It's ironic because Ben's character IS shallow and cares more for himself than for those around him. Even so, Ben really seems authentic as someone who isn't used to having to worry about others - but who really does try his best, many times, to get Andrew to wake up to reality. The other is Viggo Mortensen. You only glimpse Viggo once until the end of the movie - he's just referred to as a "rough guy" who has done many bad things. When you actually encounter Viggo (after Andrew has in essence broken into his house to confront him) you're prepared for the worst. However, Viggo is very patient, very well spoken, and quite intelligent in his commentary. He doesn't thrash Andrew for sleeping with his wife. Instead, he lays out the situation and makes both Andrew and Molly face their failings. Molly deliberately lied and used Andrew as a tool of getting a better life. Andrew, for his part, knew he'd never actually rescue Molly but led her on repeatedly to have time with her.   Some have said this is the worst movie ever. Many sections of it can be very painful to watch. However, I do find glimmers of meaning - especially in the ending discussion with Viggo. Even there, though, you would think this would be a moment of great soul searching for Andrew and Molly. Instead, both seem to think, "Yeah, I guess that's true. Oh well, see ya." I don't mind gloomy movies at all - in fact I really appreciate them sometimes. However, if a movie has no depth of character or quality acting, it just makes the whole experience fall flat. 
 More Than Human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas.  The writing is often compared to that of Faulkner but I wouldn't make that connection having read a few of Faulkner's works.  Sturgeon uses many of Faulkner's narrative trademarks (i.e. streaming conscious, first person perspective of low IQ individuals, disorienting changes in first person narrative) but I didn't feel the net effect really compared to say something like As I Lay Dying.  I love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously.  This results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books.  More Than Human is slow, dated and not what I would describe as genre transcending nor would I recommend it to others.  So the idea might of been original in the 50's but topics like telekenesis, ESP, computer-brain babies, and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before (Asimov) and since.  This book rarely set off that wow! button in my head or kept me turning pages.  This book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best.  In 1953 there were 5 Hugo Award nominees for best science fiction book (Determined in a retro hugo award ballot in 2004)  The Retro Hugo awards are fascinating because the voting (in this example) takes place 50 years later so the impact of the book on society can't really be ignored.  Besides More Than Human, the far superior The Caves Of Steel, Childhood's End, and Farenheit 451 were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci-fi.  Needless to say, More Than Human did not win (Farenheit 451 did and rightfully so)  Bottom Line:  I wanted to like this book and it doesn't surprise me that others give it such high praise.  These are probably people that don't read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests 
 H&R block does a much better job marketing software than writing it. I used the on-line version, had trouble registering so chose the option to begin entering data and register later. After about an hour of painfully slow entry, sometimes just one item per page, most of the time looking at "LOADING, PLEASE WAIT" I had to keep an appointment so tried to register and save. No luck, repeated attempts to register gave unidentified error, and I could not save without registering. Finally just left the computer on and left; when I came back TaxCut had timed out and lost all my data. By the way there is a screen which looks like you are accepting the terms of a software agreement but if you read the fine print you are agreeing to let them sell your e-mail to other companies. Even if you select NO you will get frequent e-mails from H&R Block. I will save time and do my taxes on paper forms this year. When a company can't get something simple like this right, it calls into question everything they do

 Helllo!  I am Mambo Racine Sans Bout, the same Mambo Racine about whom Ross Heaven has so many nice things to say in his book, "Vodou Shaman".  It is with some regret that I must warn the prospective reader that most of what is in this book never actually happened - Ross is willing to say anything for a buck, apparently.  He never let me see what he was writing until the book was published, and I never imagined he would make up so many stories!  Now that I have refused to support his activities he is very angry with me, but the fact remains that this book is 99% BUNK.  [... 
 When I watched this stinker, I felt like sniffing it and covering it up. This is just another attempt to cash in on nostalgia.  Obviously the producers of the film were aiming at parents fond memories of the Dr. Seuss classic childrens book and tried to exploit it into an updated version. It fails miserably. It is another example of Hollywood dumping tons of money on the look of a movie instead of the script. Dont get me wrong, this movie looks great. It has awesome costumes and set design but the problem is, it seems like they whipped the screenplay out in 20 minutes. Even the kids think this movie stinks. Do your child a favor, avoid this film and instead sit down and read your child the original book. They will appreciate it way more.   
 This book offers far less than it promises. Mostly the author hands out platitudes, then tells us how _she_ does everything and how perfect that is. She name-drops continually. Eventually the whole exercise gets so annoying you will want to throw the book, and perhaps the author too, out the window.         
 THIS MOVIE IS STUPID I SHOULD KNOW I WAS ONE OF THE FOOLS WHO BROUGHT THIS PIECE OF TRASH DON'T LISTEN TO THE PEAPLE THAT ARE SAYING THIS MOVIE IS GREAT THE MOVIE IS A HOME VIDEO THATS ALL IT IS I SUGGEST YOU READ A REAVIEW ON A SEARCH INGIN 
 It's unclear why Paley would even want to publish a book that is so absurdly indifferent to the facts of life.  Doesn't she care about her dubious reputation?  Yes, children are capable of great acts of kindness,  but you'd have to be living on Mars not to recognize that children are  equally capable of cruelty.   Paley's simplistic view is so saccharine and  unhelpful that it defies explanation.  Paley's primary interest, it seems,  is to put her own self on stage--to be the heroine in the lives of the kids  she cursorily encounters.  She's pleased as punch with herself and can  hardly stop marveling at her own genius, even goes so far as to wonder out  loud whether she should reveal her true identity to a stranger she meets on  the beach ... as if she were a rock star in disguise.  Read Robert Coles'  The Moral Intelligence of Children for a real look at how the best in our  kids can be brought out and strengthened 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 This film is set in France in 1911.  Timothy Dalton meets an old girlfriend who he hasn't seen for years, since they last met she has been married and widowed and has an adult stepson. She invites him to stay at her place in the country, but then sends him a telegram putting him off at the last moment.  Thinking she doesn't care for him any more, he embarks on an affair with a young girl he has previously been acquainted with who is at a loose end in Paris.  Later he gets a letter from old girlfriend and decides she does still care for him, so goes off to stay with her.  To his dismay, he discovers the girl he had an affair with in Paris is now governess to the old girlfriend's daughter, and moreover is engaged to be married to old girlfriend's stepson.  He decides the girl doesn't really love the stepson andtakes it upon himself to persuade the girl to break off her engagemnt (what business is it of his, I should like to know, since he doesn't want to marry her himself?).  Old girlfriend finds out about the affair with the girl and is upset, but eventually they are reconciled.  And that's about it really.  I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, but nothing ever did.  I thought maybe the two women would have a catfight over Dalton, or perhaps the stepson would shoot him in a jealous rage, or the girl might set out to prise him away from old girlfriend, but none of these things happened.  Everyone is very polite, restrained and civil, and passion is in short supply.  By the end of the film I was still waiting for the story to start.  Everyone gives good performances and do the best they can with the very dull material, but that isn't much. A good film to watch if you are suffering from insomnia. 
 My understanding of theoretical and practical physics (pick your subdiscipline) is more akin to catching a glimpse of an intricate structure in my peripheral vision than being able to read the architectural plans. But I do know a good book when I read one. Unfortunately, Gregory Benford's Cosm was not one of them. If he had wanted to explain to non-academics the differences between experimental and theoretical scientists, or to critique the workings of the scientific community, essays would have been a better milieu for the didactic opinions offered in this book. All of these are representative of the way a large proportion of academics see their work and the world, but a better novel would show the reader how these ideas impact the characters through dialogue and action.   The characters are wooden stereotypes alert to racial and sexist discriminations more reminiscent of the 1970s than what actually exists in today's universities (the novel is set in 2005). The clichés make an early appearance with "This far out from the city, people thought of quality entertainment as a six-pack of Coors and a bug zapper" (p. 8) and continue throughout.   All of this is mixed in with a bit of environmental angst as characters note suburban sprawl as an "upscale fungus" and see industrial park developments "crouched down, as if ashamed."   Benford has made modest attempts at providing glimpses of near-future technological advances.   In brief, a particle accelerator experiment of the main character, Alicia, results in the accidental creation of the Cosm, a universe which can be observed (sometimes directly, sometimes not) from inception to death throes. She is (unthrillingly) kidnapped and escapes. She displays rampant narcissism as she disregards authority and alternates between self-doubt and goddess-hood. And she finds love where she never thought to look.   
 I managed to read The Breaker in one sitting, so it can't have been all that bad. But it was a pretty unremarkable story. There wasn't really much of a mystery to uncover. I had a major problem with the character of Maggie. What was she even doing in this story? Easily the most annoying character I have ever encountered in a book. Making it worse was the fact she practically had nothing to do with the plot.  I have also read The Dark Room by Minette Walters, and found that one to be fairly average as well. She needs to work on her character development. Her writing style has more of a presence than her characters do. I doubt I will be picking up anymore by this author. 
 Well, I bought this book cause I'm learning jazz and they didn't have great tunes.  Even though it's over 600 tunes, it's still not that good.  I suggest getting another book.  Plus, like others said, the print is really tiny and it's annoying.  My friend, who plays bass, couldn't even read over my shoulder 
 The author has unearthed a large amount of information, as you would expect from a professional historian and academic.  And he wishes to share a lot of it with the reader.  His style is flat, clear and in the tradition of some of the better Wikipedia entries. If you are fond of reading histories by David McCullough, think of this as the anti-McCullough.  Long paragraphs full of detailed information, and a very long book.  Minimal amount of interpretation, synthesis and story-telling.  Tough-sledding if, like me, you had the impression from Caro's books that LBJ was an unsavory man whose lack of courage and honor kept him from ending the war when he knew he should.  There is a tidal wave of information here, data overload.  Not sure what the point is, though.  A more thoughtful, interpretative, argumentative approach would have been far better.  Do we really need to know everything he did on so many days 
 All of his books are based on lies. He states he is writing from his personal Native American experience, but he forgot to tell people HE IS A FAKE INDIAN.      I am a Native American and most of the Native American community from the 2 largest Native American newspapers Indian Country Today and News From Indian Country and International AIM know this fake wannabee is fraud and a phony.      He lied on his resume to steal a job set aside for a Native American professor. He has never faced the same discrimination as real Native Americans. He is a Cultural "Identity Thief" for his own greed and ego.       He has no shame profiting off of American Indians. He makes over $100,000 a year off a "playing" Indian. Some Anti-capitalist phony? Why take those "Eichmans" money, unless you're a hypocrite. We all know you're a big phony.      IF HE LIED ABOUT HIS NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE, THEN HOW CAN ANY OF HIS WORKS HAVE ANY CREDIBILITY?      In fact the so-called ancestor he claims "Indian" from was actually an INDIAN KILLER and killed Creek Indians in a story by the RockyMountain News, one of the largest papers in Colorado. The same tribe Churchill said he originally was from.       DON'T BUY BOOKS FROM A LIAR. BUY BOOKS WRITTEN BY REAL NATIVE AMERICANS.       If he had any honor he would step down and GIVE THE JOB TO REAL NATIVE AMERICAN and stop using the guise of American Indian to enrich himself. He is a cultural identity thief for his own agenda, big bucks and EGO. 
  	I grew up reading Harold Evan's Sunday Times - in the late 1970s it provided a window on the world that few other papers could. I particularly remember comprehensive coverage of Egyptian President Sadats historic visit to Jerusalem; ongoing coverage of Soviet dissidents and a very welcome (I'm Irish) editorial urging Britain to consider withdrawal from Northern Ireland.  However, from today's perspective, the paper's foreign coverage seemed to be written from a point of view which could be summarised as `what would the world do without Henry Kissinger?' [Indeed this has always seemed to be Mr. Kissinger's view also]; and that Soviet unreasonableness was a product of American hawkish unreasonableness and that balance, compromise and reasonableness were achievable with enough negotiation.  My memory is of positive disdain for the emerging tax revolt in California and absolute dread at the more confrontational foreign policy approach being urged by followers of Governor Reagan.  A major positive for me was the explanatory diagrams and the furtively taken photographs of Soviet missiles (SS-20s?) being deployed in Russian forests.  I was reminded of these diagrams in 2002/3 when the modern Sunday Times gave excellent descriptions - supported by diagrams - of Saddam's mobile chemical/biological weapons labs - which turned out not to exist.    	In saying all the above, I mean both to pay tribute to Harold Evans and to put in context the criticisms I have of this book - which contains descriptions of his triumphs as Sunday Times editor and his difficulties as Times Editor under Rupert Murdoch.  The book has three sections - the first describes some of the episodes which made Evan's Sunday Times great - the investigative reports from the Insight team and others, of malicious cover-ups of poor quality in the pharmaceutical industry (Thalidomide) and the aircraft industry (McDonnell Douglas); the publication of the Crossman Diaries - laying bare the rivalries and mutual disdain of the members of the British Labour Cabinet.  Having established his credentials  as a `vertical' journalist - Evan's term, which he describes as `seeking to get to the bottom of things' - and lauding his proprietors, the Thomson's, for allowing him to do so, the second part of the book deals with the advent of Mr. Murdoch as owner.  The machinations of Murdoch to gain control are fascinating, the Thomson's were drained both financially and personally by the losses induced by union activity, and they secretly dealt with Murdoch while other offers were being pursued by the editors.  Murdoch eventually won ownership of both the Times and Sunday Times, having given guarantees of editorial freedom to a board of `national directors', guarantees, which if breached, were theoretically amenable to criminal legal sanction.  As part of the change of ownership Evans was offered the editorship of the Times - one of the free worlds most revered titles.   In his description of the paper, Evans reveals an almost po-faced reverence for the place of the Times as part of the British Establishment - he sees it as the paper of record, upholding fair, non-partisan and accurate journalism which British society has come to expect. One feature of this is his constant enumeration of people's educational background, almost every colleague is named and then his/her school and university are listed - for example Joe Smith, Winchester, Oxford, to establish both social class and academic (perhaps intellectual) credentials.  He documents the `four pillars' of the Times as its reporting of Parliament, its legal coverage, its obituaries and its leader columns.  Oh dear! Stolid stuff, from the fearless, vertical, investigative editor. Nonetheless this section contains fascinating accounts of Evan's new broom editorship coming to terms with the rather lazy attitude to scoops and freshness of news which, by implication, criticise his predecessor as editor (William Rees Mogg); and show that change was indeed necessary at the institution.  Looming behind this story is Murdoch's general management style - haphazard interventions, secretive finances and lack of budgeting and planning.  From the text it seems to me that Murdoch was overstretched with transatlantic acquisitions, rather than covertly scheming to undermine Evans.  	The third section of the book reads a bit like Macbeth - Murdoch plots to renege on his guarantees and to impose his will on the editors. The text here is well paced and descriptive - the tension plays havoc with everyone, save perhaps Murdoch, Evan's second-in-command betrays him, various functionaries within the paper either resign or become lackeys, the `national directors' turn out to be paper tigers (this is too good a pun to delete), the Thatcher government sides with Murdoch and fails to taken any action as the guarantees are broken, piecemeal.  The thrust of this section reveals Evans as tragic hero, valiantly striving to uphold freedom of speech against the devious, double-dealing Murdoch, whose lackeys live in fear of his disapproval.   However, by the time I got to this section I had, sadly, lost a lot of respect for Evan's impartiality, his defence of press freedom seemed to me to cloak an innate inability to face change in the form of new commercial and political realities.  This was reaffirmed in my mind when, on the day that Evan's agreed to reign, who should phone to commiserate but Henry Kissinger!  	In the end I think the book is important in that it is illustrates that one important feature of change and leadership is that they are neither comfortable nor, initially at least, popular.   Evans, though personally engaging - and I'm sure mercurial and demanding - came to represent a set of fading political beliefs. The change occurring at the times these events described were taking place saw the emergence of economic individualism unleashed by lowering taxation rates; the antipathy to organised labour and active military competition with the Soviet Union.   The fading, indeed failing, Social Democratic consensus was overthrown by a more individualistic and competitive set of beliefs and the process was quite ugly, given the sincerely held beliefs on both sides.  I believe Evans and Murdoch were representative shadows of this change.  The rest of the story - Evans attractive forthrightness, Murdoch's furtive acquisitiveness - while the human interest focus of the story, are ultimately a side show. 	This book is well told, highly dramatic and engaging, however seen at a remove of twenty five years it is a lament from someone who worked hard to become part of an establishment whose day was done. 
 Ya Know, it still amazes me to see mostly all of tony's books with 4 or 5 star reviews. Yet, these people can't say HOW the book changed their lives, just that it was 'a great book'. I think these people just follow him blindly and swallow any garbage he puts out, it's actually a shame people are this gullible. THis book is a smaller version of ATGW and Unlimited Power. With the silly cartoons and large print, it looks like it's catered to dumb people(who have to be to follow his work) Nothing more than shallow, 'pump up' mumbo jumbo this con man is notorious for 
 "Leaving Reality Behind.." is a myopic and biased account of a subject that just isn't that interesting.  Unless you were one of the eToys.com employees or one of the 'cutting-edge European artists' of etoy, the 'Toywar' was quite simply a non-event for the rest of the planet.  In essence, the authors (who clearly are sided and likely involved with the etoy camp) are trying to dress up a relatively trivial legal dispute over a domain name that is now about three years old.  Why is this interesting??  Throw another 'yet-another-dotcom-story' on the pile 
 I ordered this October 1 as a gift and to date delivery date has been moved twice. It has been 6 weeks and amazon has just moved the delivery date another two weeks. If you can't deliver, then please remove this item from your list. 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 I read the reviews and everyone said this was a great piece of work. Well I agree that it was a peice of something but I won't go into that. This album is nothing but noise. There is no rythum to the album what-so-ever. It sounds like a band that just gets together and each person does thier own thing and records it. Absolutely horrible in my opinion. Do yourself a favor and get something like Full Blown Chaos. As for this album, save your money 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 I have not yet read this book.  It looks exciting and I hope I enjoy it.  I am reading this book for a report in JROTC 
 I'll admit, I have never looked at this book, but Michael Sullivan's other Trigonometry book is very bad. No specific exampels, vauge explanations. If this book is anything like his old one, dont get it!! 
 Quality was terrible, undersized or seconds. Later I saw the same product at a discount warehouse for 1/3 of this price.  I would not recommend these to anyone I paid and have been waiting 6 weeks for my credit. Amazon must protect buyers better or lots of business will go elsewhere. It is only when problems arist that the true color of the marketing company comes to the surface. I am disgusted with this product 
 That should have been the title of this movie as it describes the use that the talents of a high-profile cast & normally respectable director are put to.  Another possible title is "It's All About the Groceries", 'cause I'm hard-pressed to think of a reason, other than money, why anybody involved would've signed on to this project.  It starts promisingly, with atmospheric shots of the Golden Gate Bridge rising through fog over San Francisco.  The camera plunges through the fog to hone in on the image of a knife being held to a woman's throat. Once again, Ashley Judd is a victim in jeopardy . . .so it seems.  Then the 'victim' proceeds to open a can of whoop-a** all over the perpetrator and beats him to a bloody pulp.  One starts to think that this might be getting good, especially after Ashley's apparently super-competent police detective is revealed to have anger issues, a pretty hefty drinking problem, a propensity for picking up strangers in bars & having rough sex with them . . .and some grisly skeletons in her closet.  I was interested to see what Judd would do with this opportunity to play a character with a dark side instead of her usual noble victim.  Unfortunately, not enough.  Ms. Judd is a luminously beautiful actress, even with a severe short haircut meant to make her look tough, I suppose. It is not hard to believe that men would be drawn to her like bugs to a flame.  She has not developed the range of emotion to really carry a complex character like Jessica, though, playing it distressingly one-note.  Is she ecstatic?  Depressed?  In a drug-induced stupor?  The way Judd plays it, it could be any, or all, of the above.  I like Ashley Judd, but she is in danger of turning into the female version of Richard Gere--a performer with real potential who keeps choosing flashy junk-food roles that do not challenge her talent.  "Kiss the Girls" was the high-water mark & each subsequent film has been weaker than the last.  This movie is worth the price of a rental, but I'd take a pass on purchasing it.  For a better treatment of female-cop-with-dark-secrets-and-Issues, & a stronger movie all-around, I recommend "Murder by Numbers" with Sandra Bullock 
 This is not meant to serve as a useful review but as a warning that the positive reviews here at amazon are not reflective of the actual quality of the book. This book, in my opinion, is unreadable and listlessly and discursively meanders. A complete waste of time that lacks depth and resonance. Take time researching this book before you buy it because it's the worst book I've ever purchased. 
 The real title of the book should be "Why does Ziauddin Sardar hate America ?"  While the intention is good, the result is very disappointing. Ziauddin Sardar often heads in the right direction but always ends up mixing everything up by bringing his own biases in the picture. His work is extremely partial and what we call in French "instruction ? charge". He's not trying to be fair and honest, he's trying to bash America at all costs. The second you realize he's not going to acknowledge ANY positive side of the US anywhere in his book, you must conclude his book can only be a lopsided vision of things 
 Those who are looking for an introduction to Saudi history will be disappointed with this book.  It is a polemic that, from beginning to end, seeks to persuade rather than to explain.    For example, the first anecdote (involving a civilian flight made by a Saudi royal while civilian traffic was shut down after 9-11) is presented with an almost lurid suggestiveness that is never quite backed up by facts.  In fact, there are explanations for this flight that do not signify the insidious influence of the Saudis that is the thesis of this book, one of which is that the prince involved, being on a flight piloted by a pilot with CIA clearence, had been present in the country on 9-11 and delegated to assist the American government in its post haste investigations of 9-11.  Try as you might, you can't find this contention assessed and rejected.  In fact, the CIA connection was only incidentally mentioned, and this unbalanced presentation is both typical of the book and not in the least conducive to developing an analytical understanding of Saudi-American relations.    More annoying than hyperbolic and unbalanced weighings of the facts is that accurate factual presentations are often so skillfully juxtaposed with other facts as to lead the incautious reader to draw conclusions that the author never quite draws, but may seem to have drawn.  If I say cats are feline and cunning, follow with another true remark to the effect that dogs like bones, and return to the discussion of cunning, it may appear to the incautious reader that I have established that dogs are cunning.  Mr. Posner's persuasive writing certainly certainly is.  This type of lawyerly deception is given even to plainly false contentions.   This book is one in a long line of charges and countercharges of either Israeli or Arab influence in the American government.  You will have no trouble establishing which side Mr. Posner prefers.  It is also one of the line of recent right wing polemics written for popular consumption and persuasion, offering only shallow and often illusory analysis that is unhelpful to understanding our complex relationship with the Saudis, substituting only shallow cliches for real understanding.  Its informational value is extremely limited, and in fact negative if someone lacks a prior background in pertinent facts.    For this reason, though it is an entertainingly written book, there are better ways for everyone, whether well versed or not, to spend an evening 
 The plot is new..yet..it didnt offer what his other books have.. Kept dragging on with the same reasoning..over and over and over again 
 Without a doubt, one of the worst breakbeat CD's ever recorded. The mixing is terrible, the track selection leaves an incredible amount to be desired, absolutly no mood is created, and the mastering is even done poorly. Seems somebody got on her knees for Icey to put out an album.... we already know she sucks 
 At first the case seemed like a good idea, but after the third use the zipper stopped working. Because the case does not stay open on its own, there is a tendency to push the case open and force the zipper backward and apart. After fixing it a couple of times, it is now permanently broken. Bad design. Perhaps Velcro would have been better here.  
 I do not know who the target audience was here, but it certainly was not me, and I am a big Hayek fan. This book is way over my head. Perhaps a doctorate in economics or philosophy would make this work easier to read, but I don't think the average intelligent, interested reader will want to struggle though this material. It never comes up for air. 
 I was very excited about 'Victim in Victoria Station' and could not wait to get started.  However, I was soon disappointed.  The reason for Alan not being there was very contrived and I cannot imagine anyone rushing off to  keep an appointment after her experience on the train. There were too many  characters in the office to keep track of, especially since they were not  very relevant to the story.  The murders and motives are never explained,  yet we are taken ad nauseam through endless (fruitless?) late night  searches.  Not one of the best in the series. Missed the hats as well,  although I did enjoy the red one near the beginning 
 This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. It is extremely boring, the plot is full of holes, and worst of all it has Peter Facinelli. The saddest thing about the movie is that Jennifer Love Hewitt is actually a highlight 
 Try "Sam and the Lucky Money" for a good story and an accurate portrayal of life in SF Chinatown 
 The book is nothing but different tales about being a cop and their weird personalities wound around a very uninteresting story. Please tell me it aint you, joe 
 I bought this book for my husband, thinking 'aww' a book especially for him. My husband hated it. And on reading so did I. The author obviously has a very usual relationship with his wife as he often talks about feelings of jealously between them. Its very unusual. For example "when you feel the baby kicks your wife might feel jealous as so far its been her private pregnancy"! How ridiculous how would jealousy ever come into it! The book assumes all men are concerned about is finances - it has pages and pages on money, insurance etc. there is nothing much about the joys you feel as a father. If your husband is kind hearted, honest and is truly looking forward to pregnancy and the birth of his child I would advise not to buy this book. The tone is very negative and some of the statements and assumptions about what "men" and "women", are very generalised bordering on ridiculous ie "your partner might be worried that you're going to leave her" what the heck?. It seems very personally related to the authors experience, and is simply selling because it is one of the only books packaged to be directly aimed at men.  I would suggest the book "the birth partner" it is for men/the partner and is written in a matter of fact and open way (the author is not overly emotionally involved) - getting you to ask questions about how you would feel about certain situations rather than dictating how you do feel. READ THE OTHER 1 STAR REVIEWS AND YOU'LL SEE EXACTLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT 
 This is my 3rd Nora Roberts book.  I've read the first 2 in the 3 Sisters trilogy, and decided to read Chesapeake Blue while I (very eagerly) await Face the Fire in the mail.  Perhaps I was spoiled by the characters, the conflicts, and the love stories in 3 Sisters, but this book pales in comparison.  The Quinns are meant to be a family whose perfect and deep love for one another is tempered by a course and affectionate manly banter.  Sort of like 7th Heaven meets a beer commercial.  Anyways, Seth is supremely talented, handsome, kind, and sizzling in the sack; in other words, a stock Nora Roberts male character.  Alas, he is also entirely thick-headed, vain, and has the mental processes of a mule when faced with his "problem", which he only exacerbates over the course of the book.  So he has a floozy of a mother who blackmails him into huge sums of money on pain of, what, her leaking a story to the press which, once she removes all the parts that reflect poorly on her, would be about 2 sentences long?  And, he can't tell his troubles to his family that he loves "so" much?  I mean, I wouldn't tell Cam anything myself, because he seems to deal with every moment of emotion by pitching someone off the end of a pier in a fit of manly love.  But Anna and the rest seem like good candidates for a chat.  Finally, Drusilla.  First, the name makes her sound like a villian in a Disney movie.  Second, she is flat as a pancake, and I would pay for problems like hers.  At the very end, she exhibits a spark of life, and sort of morphs into another stock Nora Roberts stock character: the sassy, smart, no-nonsense, gal who steps up to defend her man.  Which, I like that character.  In my limited experience, Nora Roberts writes female friendships and falling in love brilliantly, but her male friendships need a few less put-downs and jaws clenched to supress brotherly emotion.  And, I agree with the other reviewers who wanted Seth to end up with Aubrey.  
 In 1709, thousands of Germans fled the hard times of Southwestern Germany and made their way down the Rhine to Rotterdam, where they were transported to London.  There Queen Anne took pity on them and eventually provided transportation to New York, arriving in the winter of 1710/11, where they were supposed to work in a naval stores business making pine tar and pitch for use in British ships.  They settled in the upper Hudson River Valley in East Camp and West Camp in Columbia and Ulster Counties, NY.  Although some Germans have apparently been in North American from the very beginning, this was the first large scale migration of Germans to the New World (about 3000 people in 11 ships).  Most with German names whose ancestry traces to 18th century New York prove to be part of this great Palatine migration.  Otterness is the third recounting of the Palatines' story.  Others include Walter Alan Knittle, "The Early Eighteenth Century Palatine Emigration:  A British Government Redemptioners Project to Manufacture Naval Stores," Genealogical Publishing Co., Baltimore, MD, 1937, 1965 and Sanford H. Cobb, "The Story of the Palatines:  An Episode in Colonial History," GP Putnam's Sons, NY, 1897.  Reprinted by Heritage Books, Bowie, MD, 1988.  Cobb is the original focusing on the stories told by the Palatines themselves.  Knittle is the more professional treatment which compares the stories with the written records.  Otterness now adds the extensive genealogical information obtained by Henry Z. Jones in the preparation of his three books (The Palatine Families of New York, 1985; More Palatine Families, 1991; and Even More Palatine Families, 2002).  Jones researched the old church books of Germany where he was able to identify records of hundreds of Palatines who made the voyage to New York.  Hence, Otterness is able to expand the story to include information on the distribution of the Germans.  The naval stores business soon failed.  The Germans felt mistreated and wanted the better lands in the Schoharie Valley, they felt they had been promised.  But they were held by contract to the Queen to work in the naval stores business in return for their transportation.  After the failure of the business, they faced starvation once rations were cut off.  Some scattered to New York City, to New Jersey, and to work for nearby farmers, but many settled in the Schoharie against the advice of Gov. Hunter.  There they were unable to get clear title to their lands due to conflicting claims.  Eventually some had to buy the land they had already cleared.  Others scattered.  This time some settled in Pennsylvania in Tupplehocken, in what later became the center of the Pennsylvania Dutch.  Others settled in the Mohawk Valley, where they did very well, but they encountered Indian attacks.  Otterness retells the famous story from the Schoharie.  In those sexist times, women were thought less responsible for their crimes due to their emotional state.  Hence, they were not punished as severely when convicted.  After repeated efforts to evict the squatters, the sheriff from Albany arrived to arrest leader Johann Weiser.  The women of the settlement attacked him with their brooms.  He was tied to a rail, dragged through the mud, and carried four miles to be tossed off a bridge.  Then he was attacked with stakes breaking several ribs and poking out an eye.  The women pissed in his face. He survived and made his way home, but his pride was damaged.  This is typical of the mischief the Germans carried out to express their displeasure with broken promises and their circumstances.  Otterness covers the story in concise professional language, but seemingly only the parts of the story he personally has researched.  This is not the comprehensive presentation it could have been.  His language is almost terse.  Numerous details are omitted.  He does not explain his reasons for revisions from what was previously published.  Hence, previously, Rev. Kocherthal, the Lutheran minister who accompanied the Palatines is identified as the leader of the group.  Otterness hardly mentions Kocherthal.  Instead he notes that Johann Friederich Haeger was the German Reformed minister who accompanied the largely protestant, mixed Lutheran and Reformed group.  The Palatines were attracted by tracts, especially the "Golden Book" that circulated in the area advising that Queen Anne was offering free transportation and free land to settlers in the New World.  Those claims were made more credible by reports of an earlier group of 43 pioneers led by Rev. Kocherthal to Newburg, NY, in 1708.  They were given 40 acres of land, tools, and provisions until they could produce their own, plus a glebe (landgrant) to support a pastor.  Otterness does not fully tell the story of this group.  (The Germans found the soil inferior and relocated to Pennsylvania, after which their church and glebe became Anglican.)  He references Knittle.  Otterness discounts the claim that the Palatines were refugees fleeing the repeated destruction of religious wars exacerbated by an especially cold, damaging winter.  Instead, he feels this was window dressing applied to gain support for relocation funding in Parliament by Daniel Defoe, who was a Whig politician.  Instead the Palatines were poor, who came looking for the better life promised in the Golden book.  The book does include details of the naval stores business and how those products were made.  He completely omits earlier reports that the pine trees of New York are not of the correct species to make naval stores.  Only Southern pines have been processed successfully.  He includes better details of Tuplehocken in Pennsylvania, and relates part of the story of Ephrata, a religious commune that formed around a charismatic leader nearby.  Apparently some Palatines were members of Ephrata.  He does not tell the story of the collapse of Ephrata.  (A costly bell was purchased for the bell tower without the approval of the membership causing many to leave the commune.)  He includes several nicely done maps that clarify where settlements were, but he provides little information on the Palatine colonies of New Jersey.  Others have said that the poor treatment the Palatines received in New York contrasted sharply with their acceptance by the peace loving Quakers of Pennsylvania.  Hence, after 1720, most Germans preferred to settle in Pennsylvania-building the Pennsylvania Dutch tradition.  Some have said Germans would not even step foot off a ship in New York City on their way to Philadelphia.  Otterness completely omits this aspect of the story.  Otterness manages to project the "stubborn German" stereotype for the Palatines.  They could be very unco-operative, and stubbornly stuck to their goals-good farm land-in spite of numerous adversities.     This is a useful addition to the body of knowledge of the Palatines.  It is not comprehensive.  Students will want to review all three books for details.  Extensive references and end notes.  Index (though somewhat meager).  Maps.  Illustrations 
 George Page is a journalist, not a researcher. Unfortunately, that does not save him from taking the posture of one who knows better. He dismisses whole fields of discourse with offhand remarks, for example: "Eventually behaviorism melded with the equally notorious sociobiology as formulated by E. O. Wilson." (p. 29) For an accessible yet scholarly exploration of animal cognition, I recommend Marc Hauser's "Wild Minds." Hauser is a scientist, who specializes in primate cognition. His writing is more lucid, and less affected. He addresses the same questions as Page, with an appreciation for subtle variaritions in the possible interpretations of evidence, which is lacking in Page's presentation. One comparison between the books: Page's bibliography is 3 pages long; Hauser's spans 30 
 Superficially Evening's book appears to be all that anybody would ever need about Photoshop CS2.  In fact, it is an impossible introduction for people making the jump from a simpler program, say Elements 3.0.    The organizational structure is poor.    Many ideas are used before they are explained, a fatal flaw as a text, tho' excusable in a pure reference volume.  But "For Photographers" claims to be a text and not a reference.  Terms are slipped in for somewhere without adequate definitions.  And neither the table of contents nor the index are detailed enough to help somebody find most detailed topics.  I bought Scott Kelby's book after putting Evening's on the shelf, probably for good.  Kelby gives the info a photographer making the jump to CS2 requires, although his language is famously just a bit to glib 
 I'm forced to read this book for an American History class that I'm taking, and, although the stuff inside seems fairly accurate, it can be INCREDIBLY boring. So, if you are one of those weirdos who likes watching paint dry, go ahead and buy the book 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 Only the most die hard Heinlein fans would want to read this. On the other hand, I think most die hard Heinlein fans who read it will wish they hadn't. This is not good, and is a disservice to his legacy 
 I purchased this book because it was assigned as a part of a literature curriculum for 7th Grade. I am very glad that I read this book before allowing my 12 year old son to read it. This book is about gang violence (although it is initially sugar coated as being fairly harmless pranks assigned to frightened students by one of the gang leaders.)  The book is also about angry, jaded, hateful teachers and administrators in a religious school and how they allow the gang to function in order to serve their own purposes.   The ending has the one student who stood up against the gang being beaten up quite severely for his disobedience (while the administrator of the school looks on from a nearby hill.)   Before he is taken away in the ambulance, the student tries to tell his one and only friend to just do what the gang and the faculty want him to do.   The message here is do not buck the system, no matter how corrupt the system is. Within the first few pages the book refers to masturbation.  (Another re-curring topic.)  I knew that it was questionable whether or not I would allow my son to read this book.  I read the entire book myself hoping that there would be a redeming message in the end that would justify the rest of the book.  There isn't.   This is the first book that I have ever thrown away rather than passing on to someone else. Save your money.  I don't care how many awards this book received.  It is pure trash 
 This is the worst finance book I have ever seen. For a book used for a MBA finance course it is not very helpful at all. If you are not a finance genius this book is definetly a no no. The examples leave you clueless and the theory is very general. Dare to try and solve the unrealistic sample problems at the end of the chapters, and a lot of the solutions in the solutions manual are WRONG! The professor who taught the Finance class, who has been in the field all his life and has a doctorate degree in finance admits this book is garbage and not appropriate for the MBA; beacuse of this we did not even use the book for his course. This is a very expensive and huge book and so not worth the price. I learned nothing 
 Absolute rubbish. Who publishes a cookbook without pictures. Ok. There are about a dozen pictures, but even so. 400 recipes and no pictures beside them. You eat with your eyes first. What a waste of 45 dollars. The author is a thief 
 "Gunsligers, snake-eyed varmints, low-down horse rustlers, and lily-livered scumsuckers bit the dust when John Wayne pulled out his six-shooter and started fanning the trigger." (p. 213) Trigger???  That sentence should give you an idea of just how jarring, flip and accurate this author is.  Three crops are the foundation of modern Europe's (and America's) economic and imperial hedgemony over the rest of the world: spices, sugar and cotton. Cotton is, simply, the genesis of the industrial revolution and the resurrection of American slavery. As such, the subject is incredibly important. Mr. Yafa isn't up to the task.  Yes, he's trying to write a popular history rather than a scholarly treatise. But his focus is virtually completely on America. As such is scope is simply too limited.  He mentions aniline as the foundation for synthetic indigo dye in passing in a long, rambling aside about blue jeans. Aniline and the coal-tar it's derived from are the cornerstones of modern chemistry, the chemical industry and the modern (early 20th century) German economy. Eh. No biggie.  If the guy could write, I'd probably be more forgiving of the book's shortcomings. It is a big subject.  Despite the importance of cotton, there aren't very many books extant about its history. Yafa doesn't have the sweep the subject deserves, but you will learn a few things, at least some of the outline of the story 
 This devise leaks and works marginally for spraying oil but it does raise frustration levels. I followed directions very carefully and after finding puddles of oil on the counter from this contraption, I relagated it to the garage.  
 We bought this stand mixer in September 2006, and from the first time we used it we noticed a silvery-gray deposit on the batter when it was scraped from the bowl (both bowls).  Thinking it was some coating on the new bowls, we washed and scrubbed them thoroughly--still same thing.  We thought it may be some oil coming from the motor and escaping from where the beaters are mounted, but that doesnt seem to be the case.  About the 4th time we used it the center beater jammed and cannot be removed--it is abiut 1/3" from being locked in place and wont budge.  While struggling to remove it, some grayish powder came falling out--maybe that's where the deposits are from.  Anyway, I wish we hadnt bought this product and would advise you to find another option 
 The book starts out with a horrible urban myth but set inside this prison.  A prisoner is screaming in pain, they hold him still and see his skin wriggling, and out pop worms!!!  Seems roaches laid eggs in his skin  somehow, and we all know that baby roaches are worms, right?  Puh lease.  This set the stage for unbelievability.  I learned that nothing was his fault, and he was a do gooder cruisading to help fellow prisoners at every turn.  I threw this out after reading about half of it.  I want my money back.  
 I found the advice impractical in the home setting. I would not recommend this book for parents or teachers.  Perhaps those in the clinical setting would find it helpful 
 Imagine a book filled with em dashes separated by the occasional non sequitur. There you have TS, a jumble of a hodgepodge of a melange. Occasionally delightful turns of phrase notwithstanding, TS is recommended only to bookish masochists interested in dogs of the shaggy persuasion. (Sterne's Sentimental Journey, on the other hand, is a masterpiece. 
 I was really excited to get this book, but so far I have had no success with the recipes.  The things I have made just don't taste very good at all.  The nutritional yeast taste is strong, and I like nutritional yeast, even when I reduce the amounts in the recipe.  The taste is definitely not cheese like in anything I have tried.  I was hoping for this book to help me to get over the hump and give up dairy cheese for good, but the results have been very poor so far 
 but so are his critics, especially Reviewer Phantaz Sunlyk (Whitefish, MT United States). I'm not even going to try to explain why because it would take up too much space.  For starters, read the following books: How Greek Philosophy Corrupted the Christian Concept of God - 0882906070 The Father Is Not the Son - 1890828076  The "Nicene Trinity" is a figment of medieval imagination.  This is historical fact, and the proof is found throughout medieval and world history books and texts.  It's really too well-known to even argue about it, so I won't.  Just read the books.  The author says something about the Trinity no longer being considered obtuse, secondary, and impractical dogma.  NOTHING could be farther from the truth.  Very few Protestant sects believe the Trinity exactly as the medieval bishops were forced to agree to. Even in those days, 1800 bishops signed a statement saying that they did not agree with the Nicene Trinity.  Today, mainly Catholic, and some Protestant sects accept this weakest of Christian doctrines.  The irony is that this doctrine has possibly caused more murder, torture, and mayhem than any other doctrine in any other religion, except Islam.  For nearly two thousand years "Christians" have slaughtered people in the name of the Trinity.  I paraphrase from "The Father Is Not the Son":  We do not find anything like the doctrine of the Trinity in its developed form in the New Testament. If the Trinitarian doctrines cannot be found in the Bible, then Jesus Christ and his apostles did not teach those doctrines.  If Jesus and his apostles did not teach them, then belief in such a doctrine is not mandatory for salvation. If Trinitarian doctrines are not mandatory for salvation, then they cannot be used as a litmus test for membership in the Christian community.  The Trinity is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; numerically three persons.  One in purpose. So, stop the persecution, the bigotry, the intolerance, the hate, and the arguing, and try to act like Christians.  
 The rhythms in this music are so monotonous, songs go on and on and on, with no direction, as if the songwriter didn't know how to end the song.  Very disappointed in this because an intelligent person recommended this album and I expected much much better.     Just a bunch of over-drugged and over-sexed punks, no role models here!    I don't recomend you buy this one.   
 The video-editing component of this package, Video Wave, worked great for me for about a year, but it has recently turned into a NIGHTMARE!  The audio is anywhere between 2 and 4 seconds out of sync with the video, and after trying everything I'm convinced that its a problem with the code.  A quick product search will show others who have had similar problems.  I would STAY AWAY 
 I agree with bibliophile. Most of the 'free' things were catalogs. Here's a sampling of the 'free' stuff. L.L Bean Catalogs, pamplets on raising puppies and kittens from Purina, a free copy of 'Sheer Facts About Hoisery', a Lane Bryant catalog, Lilian Vernon and Harriet Carter catalogs, a free photo or greeting from the president. And the list goes on and on. What do these things have to to with seniors? There are about 100 pages in the back where they talk about free prescription programs and some State sponsored programs for seniors. That might be the only redeeming thing in this book. I returned it to Amazon. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow zero 
 I've read more than a few of Greg Bear's books but have come across no books of his that were anything like Queen of Angels.  If I didn't know better I'd say there was a bug in his word processor that removed all the punctuation.    I put this book down a dozen times an finally gave up on it.  I never could get into it becuase I like to read one story at a time... not four.  I also like sentences that are structured.  I'm not sure what he was trying to accomplish with this but I don't recommend it at all.  It will basically frustrate the crap out of you to try and read it.  
 This book kind of sucked. I was sure I was going to like it but it failed to live up to some of the comments that others have said about it. I never really got into the story and the characters weren't at all people you would want to meet let alone read about. Save your money and buy a good book 
 My friend, Hannelore, let me borrow this book. She normally has impeccable taste in literature - so I can find no explanation for this aberration, except, perhaps, the recent death of her rabbit. An interesting concept, killed by poor imagination and lack of wit. Please spare me the pain of further such banal drivvle. Dreary, dreary, dreary 
 I don't think the authors have ever worked.  The book seems very fluffy and theoretical.  Look elsewhere for a practical ethics resource 
 I have good news for the guys in Rooney and Hot Hot Heat: you'll have plenty of free time on your hands these next few months, as Seattle's the Lashes have taken the liberty of recording your new albums for you. Be sure to send them a thank-you card from the beach. I'm only half-joking. Get It, the Lashes' full-length debut, sounds exactly like the aforementioned bands. (Maybe instead of thank-you notes, those bands should be sending cease-and-desist letters.) And while plenty of bands sound like plenty of other bands -- hell, a good chunk of CD reviewing is merely pointing that out -- what's most distressing is that, as a result, the Lashes have no personality of their own.  One minor aside: A buddy of mine teased me earlier this summer during a trip to the beach when I popped in Rooney's self-titled debut for a little driving music. "What is this? Inoffensive pop rock mix #1?" he cracked. My friend has a point, and it extends to the Lashes: the music cranked out by these acts is sunny, hooky and instantly disposable pop that works best when used as, well, driving music en route to the beach. Granted, this is not a crime, but it's hard to get too eager about such ephemeral music.  Every track on Get It -- with the exception of the mid-tempo, string-section aided "Dear Hollywood" -- is upbeat and interchangeable-with-every-other-track-on-the-disc power pop, from the jangly single "Sometimes the Sun", the New Wavy flourishes of "The World Needs More Love Letters", and the bouncy keyboards of "Nate's Song". Trying to differentiate between these songs is like trying to pinpoint the differences between brands of toothbrushes -- they all do about the same thing, with very little variation. I mentioned that there are no actual crimes against music on Get It, but the Lashes are guilty of playing it too safe.  
 this was a tiny book, that didnt really offer anything helpful at all. I would love to send it back and get my money back 
 Being an engineer in the aerospace industry I was highly interested in this book based on my experiences from the vantage point a "hard industry." I personally believe that it's in our long term interests to maintain a strong manufacturing base because that's the foundation of real wealth, not legal services or newswires. So this book sounded like the perfect source of information to explain our current economic situation, give an assessment of how bad or how good it really is, and suggest ways to improve it. Oh, how very, very wrong I was . . .    This book started off strong, . . . for about four pages. After that a litany of tortured logic, un-sourced assertions, facts taken completely out of context except for the author's subjectively added adjectives, Orwellian double-speak, sleight of hand arguments, flat out ridiculuos statements, contradictory assessments, and even emotional vitriol coalesced not so much into an argument for industry but one for eighteenth century mercantilism with perhaps a sprinkling of far left George Soros on top to serve as an update for the twenty first century.   Even a broken watch is correct twice a day though, so there were some good points in the book which buy it the 2 star rating. These include:   - Manufacturing provides a large source of proprietary knowledge which both improves productivity and serves as a barrier of entry, creating an industry with a large base of high paying jobs, provided it's run right. (A big if.)   - High wage nations can still compete effectively with low wage nations in manufacturing by being capital intensive.   - Americans need to save more and our education system needs to produce more engineers and technically oriented graduates.   - There is some excess in the financial services and managers of publicly traded companies take too short term a view, leading them to sell the company upriver in the long run because of a personal temporary short term gain. (i.e. Enron)    A scholarly, fair, and comprehensive book that focused on the above would be extremely interesting and useful. This is not what you'll get in this book though. Instead you'll get:  A begining section about postindustrialism, things like the internet, information technology, financial services, etc., the things that make the services based economy. In three chapters the author simply sets up straw men by taking the worst examples of post industrial advocates, instead of presenting a comprehensive picture of the post industrial argument. Not being satisfied with this he proceeds to beat the straw men, set them on fire, and piss on the smoldering remains. This is where vitriol even comes out, where he equates the post-industrialists to people incapable of even thinking. If someone has to go to this extreme to make their argument, they probably don't have one. Most telling he leaves the final assessment of the value of the internet to a feminist. To me, this would be like leaving the final assessment of how good a bicycle is to, oh, I don't know, let's say a fish.  A middle section extolls the virtues of manufacturing. This is a bunch of hand picked anectdotal stories and there's no overview of manufacturing in the world or its real impact on economies at large. This is the kind of subject that screams for reams of data, charts of GDP growth over time, pie charts of the breakdown of economies into services, manufacture, agriculture, etc. You will get none of that. There's little value except in reassuring the obvious, high wage nations CAN do manufacturing. Many of these cherry-picked anectdotal examples still don't quite dove-tail with all his claims about manufacturing though! You also know you're being left in the dark with a plethora of CYA disclaimer statments like "while Industry_X has certainly had its share of problems recently . . ." at the begining of a section.     A final section basically amounts to an attack on laissez-faire, free markets, and the concept of free trade. George Soros and a bunch of other lefties, with Pat Buchanan thrown in for "balance", should be listened to instead.   The worst part of this book is the author's lack of an ability to make any sort of coherent argument. Examples of twisted thinking abound:  - A post-industrial "industry" grows five times over in a certain period. The author then goes onto explain how this is not really real growth but something that in reality is bad. Later he proves how great a manufacturing industry is because in the same period it grows a whopping 60%! Self contradictory evaluations of the performance of services vs manufacturing is common and always falls down on the side that the manufacturing industry is far far better than the service industry even when all the standard economic indicators suggest otherwise. The author's challenge to the reader seems to be "who are you going to believe? Me, or your lying eyes?"   - He rips into American post industrial industries as being labor intensive and vulnerable to low wage nations because Americans are no smarter or more creative or more anything than laborers around the world. Later he talks about how great German manufacturing is because Germans are so much more diligent than the rest of the world's workers.   - The only facts he presents - and they are surprisingly thin and overwhelmed by mere assertions - are always modified by his subjective opinion and never put in context. When describing service industries "paltry" $50 million revenues, "only" 60,000 jobs, "disappointing" 24% of revenues from foreign sources is common. But when describing manufacturing "a very high" $6 million revenues, "a good mix" of 1,500 jobs, and similar glowing assessments are inevitable despite the number to follow. A number in and of itself means nothing. The fact the author leaves out any head on, direct comparison between industries is telling.   - Official figures are the ultimate source of information when they agree with what the author believes. When the official figures don't agree with him, he finds some loner who does and then barely explains how this time around the official figures are somehow wrong. When attacking his straw men though, he accuses them of ignoring official figures and quoting some loner.    - Gems of Orwellian double-speak sentences include examples like "Solar is already a fully competitive source of energy in remote areas that do not have grid electricity. (pg. 184)" I.e. it's competitive where there is NO competition! And "Even in Singapore, one of the freest societies in the East, the savings rate was successfully boosted by a system of forced savings . . . (pg. 229)" That's not very free if it's FORCED is it? (His defense of solar is one of the most hilariously pathetic eight pages I've ever read and really is worth the price of the book. He capstones it with the "most encouraging" observation that solar cells have gone from producing one third of the energy used to make them before they wore out - that is consuming more total energy in their manufacture than they eventually make!- to now producing three times as much energy as required to produce them before they wear out. Wow, what an achievement. Any ACTUAL power source converts many thousands of times the energy used to manufacture it before it's internal workings wear out, but whatever . . .)  - Americans are dumb and the only successful American companies basically blundered into monopolies on standards. The American economy, despite the statistics, is in bad shape. The Japanese instead are eight feet tall, can read people's minds and see through lead. The Japanese economy, despite the statistics, is in really great shape. This type of persistently biased characterization makes you question everything he claims, and eliminates any value or truth he might actually have in his arguments. The author basically can't get out of his own way.    - He always attacks opponents of his viewpoint by claiming that they don't put numbers into context, are using twisted logic, making mere assertions instead of quoting facts, etc., apparently oblivious that these are the very same tactics he himself uses!  - He claims Boeing is no longer a good company because 30% of components in a Boeing aircraft are now made abroad vs. 2% in the 1960's. This is actually because foreign manufacturing for those components happens to be better and cheaper. America isn't doing that badly in aerospace by the way. The author fails to mention that 50% of the "European" Airbus is made in America. This is an example of free trade actually distributing production to where it is most efficient.   The list goes on and on to ridiculous proportions. You'd have to buy the book to see them all because there's at least one thing an alert and critical reader can find highly questionable on each page.   All in all, this book was way off the mark and a highly squandered opportunity. It's really a mercantilist argument, and the only common thread that I could see in all the author's cloudy reasoning is that nation's should do everything in their power to export more than they import no matter what. It's NOT, unfortunately, a book about how to revitalize American manufacturing in a globalized world. 
 Roth consulted some records but apparently failed to understand the the explicit meaning of forced conversion.  This work is an example of failing to use the whole record for an accurate conclusion.  There many are inquistion records, especially in the New World, of Jews clinging to the faith of their fathers and dying in inquisitional flames as a result.  Also, the Amsterdam Jewish community was established by Crypto-Jews this author contends didn't exist.  This blatant failure to get the facts right leads one to believe that Roth either has a hidden motive or is incompetent beyond belief 
 Does Turtledove devoutly wish the South had won the Civil War for its own sake, or is he just one of those admirers of Robert E. Lee (there were many at my alma mater, Vanderbilt) who can't bear that his hero came out on the losing side? Either way, surely Turtledove could have come up with a better vehicle for reversing the outcome of the Civil War than South African racists traveling back in time to arm the American rebels with yet-to-be-invented guns. The thugs of the 21st century have misjudged the motives of the noble South and the nobler-still Lee, but the general will accept their weapons anyway, thank you. This trick presages the wooden plotting and shallow characterizations to come. Turtledove's main non-historical character is a teacher-soldier who seems to come out of and return to nowhere, with no mention of family or background. Characterization in general has Turtledove stumped, so he turns to cliches, such as the prostitute with a heart of gold (this one masquerades as a male and dons a uniform to serve the Confederacy and service the main character). Turtledove even has a tragic mulatto woman on a postwar auction block. Blacks are few and rare in Turtledove's novel, and they are swept off the stage after the briefest of appearances, speaking only conventional phrases, and in dialect, of course. Both the rupture of the American Union and the continued births and deaths of millions of Americans in slavery (his Lee fashions a gradual emancipation in which blacks will "earn" their freedom decades into the 20th century) are treated by Turtledove as worthy of little more than a shrug. The more ambitious but nearly as wooden "alternate history" novel, Ward Moore's "Bring the Jubilee," at least was very sober about the consequences of a rebel victory. If you are going to reverse the outcome of a war so momentous in American and world history, don't do it as trivially as Turtledove has done in this book. There is potential for a great story in the fictional reversal of the outcome of our Civil War, but "The Guns of the South" is not it 
 I agree with a lot of what the author states, particularly regarding bad English (being accepted) and a tendency toward violence being more prone in the South, but not a lot of the other claims.   As a born and bred Southernor, of Scots-Irish Heritage, I found it puzzling that Sowell claims there was a sense of "idleness" about those who are from the "Celtic Fringe".  While I would agree there was a general lack of organization, the Scots-Irish are known as a whole, throughout all cultures in the US (by those who are aware of who they are, ethnically) as being extremely hard working, spend-thrifty and industrious.   Although he has frequent quotes, some of them appear to be very general, or cherry-picked to fit neatly within his argument. For example, there are numerous indications, quotes from contemporaries at the time of the Civil War, that Northerners generally lacked the desire and work ethic to compete with their Southern counterparts in Wartime.  In fact, the South was DWARFED industrially, by the North, yet took a FULL FOUR YEARS to defeat, with a significantly smaller population.  Men from the South were much better disciplined and much less likely to desert.  It was difficult for the Union to motivate men to sign up, to fight, and to march long distances and fight. The South routinely defeated Union Armies of greater numbers, and many of the Southern victories were acheieved by officers of Scots-Irish (Celtic) heritage, including Nathan Bedford Forrest and Stonewall Jackson.   Furthermore, unlike black Americans, the Scots-Irish (and Irish) are KNOWN for their industrial, self-sufficiency, and rugged individualism.  Blacks are not known for that at all.  In fact, they are the complete, polar opposite, culturally.  To even suggest welfare as a way of life, to my grandparents in Alabama would have led to a severe tongue lashing and speech about individual pride and sufficiency.  These traits are not characteristic of Black Americans at all, with the high proportion of welfare, the dependency on Government and others (Whites).    Some of the greatest leaders in early American history, were of Celtic heritage, from Taylor, to Clay, to Calhoun, to Jackson, to Lee, to Wilson, to Reagan, Clinton and Kennedy, to Carnegie, McCormack, and the list goes on and on.  In fact, Irish and Scots-Irish Americans have had a greater influence on American industry than perhaps any other groups (I believe JP Morgan was of Welsh Ancestry).    There is a propensity toward violence in the South, particularly from those who descend from the Celts, and I am in agreement that there was and is a more general lack of social graces, within the general population.  But I am not sure that can be viewed as a clear nexus to current Black culture.    Virginia alone produced 8 presidents (and if you add Carter and Clinton that's ten), numerous military heroes, including the most decorated American soldier ever, Audie Murphy (from Texas and Scots-Irish). Ironically, even Jessica Lynch is Scots-Irish, it just so happens.   While I agree that those of Celtic Heritage are "rowdy" worldwide (in the UK, Australia and the American South), they are extremely hard working. I would put your average kid from Eastern Tennessee up ANY DAY from some long-haired, skateboarder from Vermont at a job site.  When I was in the service, most of my Nothern buddies had never cleaned their own bathroom, or worked in Fast Food, or done anything.  They were indeed, more educated generally (or better) and had more money.    I just don't see too much similarity between American Black culture and that of the descendents of the Celtic Fringe.      
 Before you pick up this "novel", please read a biography of Jerzy Kosinski's life by author James Park Sloan --Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography. In 1982, Kosinski was completely discredited by the Village Voice for fabricating his auto-biographical, The Painted Bird, and for plagarism found in his most of his other books. He slandered an entire nation (Poland) in The Painted Bird even though he was actually saved by Polish Catholics and lived in safety during the duration of the war. Instead of writing what was a true war experience he decided that shock and brutality would give him more notariety. He became rich and won countless awards and accolades for his damaging lies.  Before he committed suicide in 1991 he tried to make amends for the damage he caused to the Poles but it was too late. The Painted Bird has been deemed a "truth" and has been included on the reading lists of many Holocaust Study Courses.  I feel sorry for the Poles -- that this work produced by a sick, deviant and demented pathalogical liar could be taken as a true experience --it's like spitting on the graves of all those, Jews and Poles alike,that died in the hands of the Nazis during WWII.  It is a terrible injustice 
 I have a fairly new computer (Fujitsu S7110 laptop) and this SW won't run on it. It installs without any error. Clicking on the program icon results in nothing happening. As a test I installed it on my desktop (a CyberpowerPC) and it runs just fine. But, I need it on my laptop, not my desktop. It doesn't do me any good while on the road to be running on my home machine. I called tech support and they basically had me disable all the boot time software and services and, yes, the software does run. But is that really a solution? It's more like a kludge. The software has issues and Magellan doesn't want to admit it. The Magellan web site hints that version 2.0 of DirectRoute won't run on all DVD drives, but they don't provide a solution.  I asked if they would upgrade me to version 3.0 and they said no.  This software was essentially a waste of money for me.  
 This books main failing is that it ends up with Pages of listings of the methods that you can use in Ant which is not really why one buys a book in my opinion.  The book feels padded and does not have the feeling of a reference text that a team would use; rather it is functional and dry.  However, it does cover all the major aspects of Ant so it's not a complete loss 
 Contrary to the title, I found the book more on the theoretical side. Lots of classifications with questionable practical value. The examples are high-level ending up with more classifications. Same observation about the simplistic figures. Chapter 13-The World Wide Web gives an introduction of the initial Web requirements, while Chapter 16-J2EE/EJB explains general ideas about EJB. My benchmark for an "solid" book, with somehow related topic, would be "Design Patterns" by Gamma,Helm,Johnson,Vlissides 
 As an Alice in Wonderland collector, it was fun to have something new, but it is such nonesense, it will just sit in my collection 
 I read about three-quarters of the book and had a nagging feeling that the author was not being truthful.  I then came to Amazon and read the reviews.  After that, I skimmed the rest of the book.    I'm a big fan of true survival stories, and I give the book two stars simply because I believe it took a lot for the author to survive his time in the wilderness.  However, the fact is that he is the lone survivor and the only person who knows what went on before, during and after the accident.  As mentioned in previous reviews, he has omitted the specific finding of the NTSB that found him to be the CAUSE of the accident.  There's also that disturbing discrepancy about the ELT.  Clearly, he did not remove it from under the seat, and even if he did, apparently it would not have been operational. If he's not truthful about these things, can we really believe the rest of his story?  Of course, I do believe it took a lot to survive, but, for example, did he really encounter a bear?  All in all, the major factual omissions that point to his responsibility for the accident overshadow and seriously call into question his credibility on the rest of the story.  
 Ernest Hemingway dies on page 161 of this 300-page book and so does author Valerie Hemingway's story. For that reason this book merits only two stars. Early in her story of meeting Hemingway in Spain in 1959 at age 19, Valerie is aware of the author's magnetic and dominant personality, "Around him everything came to life....There was an urgency and vitality that...did not ebb."  When she stays focused on the story of Ernest Hemingway, this is an endearing look at the older, struggling Hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent Irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of "A Moveable Feast."  But the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject. As a result, her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as A. E. Hotchner's "Papa Hemingway." The two years she spent living and traveling with Hemingway through Spain, Paris, Key West, Cuba, and America, share as much space as her weird marriage with Hemingway's strange son, Gregory (apparently the other "bull" referred to in the title).   It shows the continuing vitality of Ernest Hemingway - even in death and over 40 years later - that a Valerie Hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man 
 Because of tummy troubles, my doctor ordered me on a very bland diet.  Well this stuff is JUST what the doctor ordered, as it is almost completely tasteless.  I can't give it a one star which qualifies as  hating it, as I can't hate anything that has pasta as one of the ingredients, but it is not good.  It makes Kraft Mac and Cheese seem very exciting!  I would not reorder and would fear ordering anything else from Annie's.  This would only be for young children who hate anything with a taste to it 
 Someone reported all my 3 negative reviews of Daniel Silva books and got them removed! Hmm, I wonder who that could be.    I am rather annoyed at this because I spent quite a lot of time detailing why I didn't like this book, reasonably, I thought.  Apparently, someone had decided that they did not follow the review guidelines. Well, I used no profanities. OK, there were some spoilers, but not more than I usually read in other reviews. Not single worded, no phone numbers, no solicitations, etc. Maybe whoever it was just didn't like my negative review. The last time I checked, the 1st amendment still applies in this country.  OK, so let me try to post another review of why I didn't like this book without violating any review guidelines, and I'm not going to spend 30 mins on it like last time.   I thought the book was very poorly written and very boring. It was very tedious to finish but I made it to the end. I've read a couple of other Daniel Silva books, but neither one of them could change my mind that he is an author that I don't like. I will not be buying any more of his books 
 Ok, this was a kind of nice little book. But not really. The information inside of this book was VERY basic. It never went into details about betta housing (just kept on referring to betta bowls, tiny little bowls in which a betta WOULD NOT be happy in). So thats what took away some starts, was the lack of useful information.  This book had a lot of pictures. Pictures are all well and good, but not in this book. Most of the pictures were of older, boring 'veil tail' finned bettas. Those are bettas of the past. Now we have half moons, and crowntails, so much better. But there was one image of a half moon, and one or two of delta tailed bettas. So the betta community was not represented in the least by this book. Just old veil tails.   Overall, not a good book. 
 I love this movie as I have seen it many times.  Audie Murphy did a great job in playing himself, although it must have been really hard to relive.  A movie that I would highly recommend. 
 Why Paul Findley hates Israel is not clear.  What is clear is that he has written a book with lies from the Arab world.  The U.S.-Israeli Relationship is the only democratic relationship in the middle east.  Let's respect it, not attack it 
 I thought I was getting a bargain - Rockports at a discount!  When they arrived, the craftsmanship and finish impressed me.  Stitching looked even and the shine was appropriate for dress wear. They are comfortable enough (maybe a little snug), but I though it was odd that they creased across (rather than to the rear of) the cap.  Within a few days, however, the skin-like coating (perhaps the waterproof layer?) of the uppers separated from the underlying leather, creating blisters in the creases.  Within a few weeks, those blisters tore, exposing the leather underneath.  I'm not sure where this will end, but at less than 2 months old, they will soon look too bad for dress wear.  And, I suspect that the waterproofing has now been compromised.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price!

 Hawthorne Heights is just a horrible and desperate attempt in trying to fit in with the whole emo trend. The lyrics are WAY to simple and pointless. This CD isn't completely horrible, but I would still reccommend that you buy another CD such as:   *Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge - My Chemical Romance *Define The Great Line - Underoath *Liberation Transmission - Lostprophets *Hours - Funeral For A Frien 
 If you are looking for the original emyth book that is LOADED with earth shattering ideas about how small business owners should look at their business - this is NOT it.  A very dissappointing philosophical book that meanders around with little inspiring points.  The emyth original is at the top of the must read books for business owners and this one might be near the bottom.  Not to say that there are not some bright spots, but they are few 
 As the title says the book is rife with Catholic apologetics.  Catholicism is the touchstone used to compare pretty much every belief and "ism" to (i.e. protestantism, arianism, etc...) This review is not to make a case for or against Catholicism, but to demonstrate the ludicrous "scholarship" of this work, as opposed to what one would expect from any work claiming to be a "dictionary."  Instead of spending it's words on the historical aspects/development of a given belief, the entries are dominated by apologias for, or against, said belief from the Catholic point of view.  This behavior is exemplified in the treatment of the Trinity doctrine entry, and oddly, a venomous attack on Jehovah's Witnesses  (while giving fair accounts to pretty much every modern religious movement that Catholicism generally deems: "heretical.").  The Trinity:  More than half of the entry is dedicated to exegesis of New Testament passages according to modern Trinitarian thought following the claim that (pg. 1394): "Though the word 'Trinity'.. is not found in Scripture, the conception is there both implicitly and explicitly."  Also, the very first sentence of the entry calls the Trinity doctrine: "The central dogma of Christian theology", however, in providing an argument, instead of historical facts, the work relegates itself to the category of apologetics, not scholarship.  As an argument, it naturally downplays the significance of the opposing viewpoints, in this case: the "heresy" of Subordinationism (a topic that doesn't even receive it's own entry in this "dictionary"!), its proponents, Gnosticism, and the prevalent Arianism.  The author violates the context of the historical development of what it calls "the central dogma of Christian theology" by glossing over centuries of the doctrines' development;  even going so far as to label some of the defenders and propagators (pre-Nicea) of early Trinitarian thought: "unorthodox" (despite the fact that "orthodoxy" hadn't been established yet). (pg. 1394 - "Where the doctrine was elaborated, as e.g. in the writings of the Apologists, the language remained on the whole indefinite, and from a later standpoint, was even partly unorthodox.  Sometimes it was not free from a certain subordinationism..")    On Christian Science (pg. 279): "Its teaching on the unreality of matter, sin, and suffering conflicts with the Biblical doctrines of the Creation, Fall, and Redemption."  The author fails to note that this is opinion (regardless if accurate or not).  Jehovah's Witnesses (pg. 729): "This Adventist teaching was developed by his successor, J.F. Rutherford on lines professedly subversive of civil authority...  They can hardly be regarded as a religious society..", "Jehovah's Witnesses is an organization with printing establishments all over the world.  They carry on an effective propaganda among an uncritical public and attract esp. the dissatisfied elements of society by preaching hatred of all existing institutions."  Of the founder, Charles Taze Russel, the author again levels the charge of subversive teachings, and again makes the implication that Witnesses are civically disloyal anarchists (pg. 1210): "His teaching... lends itself to political propaganda of a subversive type...  His ideas were developed in a still more anarchist direction by J.F. Rutherford."    Again, regardless if you hold the assertions made to be true, or not, the conclusion is unequivocally clear.  I don't recommend spending more than 5$ on this book (including shipping).  I gave it 1 star (because I can't give it zero), despite it's thoroughly un-scholastic nature, it is a good resource to have handy if you want to quickly know the dates of certain events  (or if you need to prop up a table leg, or if you need a highly absorbent coaster).  DO NOT expect nuanced, objective, comprehensive entries on any subject in this work (i.e. a DICTIONARY!).  EXPECT argumentative, judgmental prose, and a total lack of objectivity. 
 My view is skewed.  I was in VA-196 and flew with Steve Çoonts a few times as a B/N.  His book captured our collective squadron stories and placed the A6A Intruder into the public eye.  People would tell me about their experiences while reading the book...they did not know my connection to it.  Steve wrote so well that they could smell the cockpit and sense the adrenalin.  While the movie paralleled our actual experiences at sea and in port, it did not convey the excitement of the book.  So, I was disappointed in my expectations and give the film a good try. W. Stewart Tittle, Lt USNR 1966-71 
 While I am glad that this type of book helped the reviewers who gave it high marks - anyone who has been to physical therapy for their back pain has been given the exercises that were covered. After looking through the content cover to cover, only 2-3 positions would qualify as "yoga" and the rest would fall under "floor exercises" or "home exercise program." I think the title was misleading as I was looking for a book showing yoga positions in succession of difficulty w/ clear explanations on how to graduate more advanced positions based on your skill level and back issues. This was not the book I thought it was going to be 
 I think this book was okay. There were some funny parts, and I have to say that I did grow to like and admire Chris. But all in all, I was dissapointed. It was boring and I am one of those reviewers that didn't like the style he wrote it in. He was repeatative, like when he mentioned a million times about his and his moms tempure. I would love to have a reading with him and would never question his abilities, but it just wasn't a really good book 
 I had this book required for a class, and although it certainly has a lot of information, it is a very poor textbook especially for an introduction.  There is WAY too much information on some subjects and unnecessary detail.  It reads more like a collection of peer reviewed articles than it does a textbook.  The authors need to learn to HIGHLIGHT the important results and summarize information in a concise way.  Even graphs are presented in very confusing manner (variable symbols not consistent in comparable graphs.  Many authors also makes for different style changes...  Then again, I have little background in biology, and only moderate interest in the subject, so that might slant my opinion 
 Mr Davidar thought he was writing the great Indian novel. Unfortunately, what came out at the end was a schoolboy effort, characterized by Raj cliches, prose that sounds like it is translated, and occasional paragraphs containing personal views on India and Indians which dont mesh with the main text at all. I am glad I borrowed this free of cost from the library and did not waste my money - though I did waste my time reading it. All I can say is that it would make good reading on a long flight - at least the story has tempo and keeps you mildly entertained 
 I won't beat around the bush, this is a terrible product.  I was looking for something to allow Mic level recordings on my computer (Macbook Pro) and I wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money on an iMic.  I found this remarkably cheaper device, and decided to try it instead.  When I got it, the first thing I thought upon seeing the packaging was how un-professional it looked.  The box looks like something someone printed off their computer, and it even had spelling errors on it.  When I popped the device out of the box it came apart in my hand.  Right then I knew I had made a mistake.  It comes with a minidisc that 1. doesn't fit in a mac, and 2. only had PC software on it.  Of course the box and the product page don't say what platform this device is for, and indeed my Mac did recognize it when plugged in.  However, when I switched over to USB audio out, my ears were nearly blown out.  There was absolutely no way to control the volume.  Upon plugging in a Mic, I found the device didn't even respond  The audio in channel lights up half way as though it's picking up some signal, but it doesn't make a sound (tested with Line In and Garage Band and no response).  This is a shoddy, unprofessional product that should be avoided at all cost.  Don't be cheap, I'm sure the iMic is loads better 
 I look for games to play at family get togethers and simple dinner parties. After reviewing all of the games in the book, I found only one that I could use. The others require too much preparation. For instance, "Mad Advertising" has you record 20 commercial from the TV and find an obscure question to ask about the commercial. When the game begins, you show the commercial and ask the question, and see who gets the most correct answers. That's too much time and trouble, and not that fun. 
 I bought this fan mainly due to the positive reviews here.  However, I decided to return the fan for refund on the very first day it arrived because it doesn't push as much air as it was claimed by other reviewers here.  I like its look but a fan must at least achieve its primary objective which is to cool the room; I don't think this fan achieves this objective at all 
 This movie was so boring and slow moving that we turned it off after 45 minutes. Not recommended as it was too boring 
 The book came as described in excellent shape and arrived quickly.  I hate the book though. The rhymes are not very good. Just a few variations of words but nothing to really jump rump for a long period of time to. I was hoping for some of the playground rhymes I can't remember from childhood. It seemed like somebody just wrote down some words that sorta rhymed but had no reason. 
 When I first started reading this book, I thought it was good but lacked a little in detail. It skimmed over some parts when discussing various events the band experienced. At first, I thought this was because so much has been written about these before. But as I read on, it appears more that the author either didn't do his research, or didn't do enough of it. When it comes to Kurt's experiences with Courtney, no mention is made of Courtney's actions, leaving the reader to believe Kurt was always at fault. Also, it glossed over the heartbreak Kurt suffered when Frances was taken away and what they both went through to get her back. Considering what an impact this had on all three of them, the lack of information is questionable, at best. He also never mentions the fact that the doctor who treated Kurt during the Rome incident said there was no evidence Kurt had swallowed ANY, let alone 50, Rohynols. He simply goes by Courtney's comments around this event. When it comes down to Kurt's death, not only does the author always refer to it as a suicide, which has not been 100% proven to many people, but he gets his 'facts' wrong. Kurt was not disfigured so badly that he could only be identified by his fingerprints. He did not barricade himself in the greenhouse; the stool in front of the back door - where there was no way of gaining entry as it was a balcony - was a small barstool that couldn't block anything even if someone could scale the balcony. Kurt's wallet wasn't lying open next to his body; a policeman stated HE had opened the wallet and put it there when they were taking pictures. Also, Wendy didn't make the missing person's police report; Courtney has admitted that she called the police pretending to be Wendy. The author states that Wendy, Courtney, and Krist decided where Kurt's ashes would be spread. As far as anyone knows, besides Courtney, some of Kurt's ashes were made into several tsatsas by monks in Ithaca, NY, some were buried under a tree at the Lake Washington house (both of these according to Courtney), and some were allegedly spread on the Wishkah River. No one really knows what happened to Kurt's ashes, except for Courtney. When one looks at these items the author either didn't include, or made major mistakes about, it makes it hard to take any of the rest of the book as truth. While it's a good read - at least the first part of it - there are many other books out there about Kurt that are much better 
  well, sometimes a generalizing lie. .  IMHO, this book should have been named "(some) Spidering Hacks using Perl" .  the "100" and "industrial strength" sale pitches they could have spared from the title as well .  the very little python and java code that was either mentioned and/or included as code examples I think was as a way to pepper the content and apparently make it more appealing to a broader audience .  ._ the book is mostly about Perl scripts (you could compile Perl to C and then use c2java, for example, but why bothering if, as I noticed right away, it was mostly toy code?) I wonder what the "industrial strength" thing was all about.  There is also some gnu utils examples (wget and curl), from which you could get better examples online  ._ the book has "examples" that don't make any sense (to me) and not only that but you could see as a total waste of time, why bothering scraping amazon's pages if they offer SOAP/RSS feeds? And not only that but then he goes on telling you how to scrape a site offering financial stocks info, too!?!?! I would have started by splitting the book in two, cases for which you don't really need scraping at all and those for which you do  ._ the author in an attempt to reach the "100" mark, included cases on how to download, say MP3 with Beatles songs and PDF files from IRS sites as separate cases :-? I wonder what the difference is once you have a connection to the data feed?!? .  there is, "Web Content Mining with Java" ISBN: 047084311X and as you see the publishers/authors named this book after what it is all about and if you want to read about "industrial strength" approaches I would recommend "Mining the Web" ISBN: 1558607544 .  usually "hacks" books are about hacks, meaning you already know your stuff and are learning some hacks. If you know the basics of spiders and how to retrieve data off the Net programmatically this book is not for you. If you, on the other had, are new to this subject and are a Perl programmer you may learn a few things from it .  ot 
 Not there best work! If you like to watch concerts that don't seem to make the grade then buy this one 
 I purchased this book after reading previous reviews of a new and cutting edge running style. After reading this, I am very disappointed. There is nothing new here. The running techniques used in this book are the same ones that have been taught and used by top runners for many years. Landing with your foot under your center of gravity, avoiding heel first footstrike, soft knees, high heel kick, fast turnover with short footplant time, avoiding braking action, running smoothly with little vertical motion are all running form pointers that are taught by any good coach. This is a very high price for a book that has very little new information 
 The reviewers here seem to be getting things right. There is a liveliness to Solomon's prose, and it can be informative, and Solomon does bring up important stuff, as reviewer Schroeder says.  It is also true, as reviewers Wiz and Meister say, that Solomon achieves this by being breezy, light, sometimes incoherent, and always rather touchy feely.   I find that the book has barely a hint of structure to it.  What it has it gets from Solomon's ramblings about ad hominem fallacies in Nietzsche.  These remarks fill out the first chapter of the book, but they are talked about and hinted at in the introduction and elsewhere. Solomon has published these ideas about Nietzsche and ad hominem fallacies elsewhere.  They appear highly convoluted and specious to me.  Solomon has spent his entire career writing about virtue, and, predictably, the chapter on his specialty is the strongest one.   In response to reviewer Schroeder I will just say that Nietzsche never held that "resentment is always a corrupt motive" and so Solomon's criticism of Nietzsche on this front is a straw man. The same point is made by Dr. May in the book called Nietzsche's Ethics and His War on Morality.   Clearly the weakest part of the book is its confusion of ad hominem fallacies with things that are non-fallacious, such as reasoning about human motives and about human psychology.  There seems to be no good reason for Solomon to use the term ad hominem on many occasions where he does so.  It is as though he wants to have an important idea about logic, but his big idea amounts to calling psychological explanation ad hominem.  Explanations are not even arguments, so there can be no fallacy in them 
 The artist formally known as Vanity 6 is now an ordained minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ.  Vanity 6 is dead but Sister Matthews lives to declare the glory of God!!!!!!! 
 I read all the great reviews about this book, but what really made me buy this book is because one reviewer described how he/she trains in martial art for so many years and this book offers effective and deadly self defense moves with no training required. ok, so i bought the book for about $13, when the book arrived I was surprised by how small and thin it was, yeah its only 96 pages, but its half the size of a notepad. Anyhow, its the content that count right? Well, I read through the whole book in less than a hour, the book does help set your mental state and mental awareness, it describes different situation and how criminal now are more violent than ever. It uses the scare tactic to prepare your mind into thinking: "fight to kill, or be killed". Everything is great until I get to the actual 12 technique section...then it starts getting disappointing....its like technique #1: kick, #2, punch, #3 poke eye, #4 punch some more.....you get the picture. Then you get to the pictures section, which pretty much look all the same except in a different scenario. Just click on the available "Search Inside" Amazon images and that's basically it. Pull hair, hit throat, poke eye, kick inside knee...ok, maybe I knew more about self defense than I thought I did, all these techniques are very effective but I consider them as survival instinct and second nature, I was hoping for so much more based on the review. In the book it mentions being approached by multiple aggressor, but no where does it teach or show you how to defend against multiple aggressor.   Anyhow, this book can be recommended for anyone as a starter "mental preparness" book whom has never read an self defense book in their life. But for a good starter self defense book I would recommend Royce Gracie's book instead.   All in all my next self defense book will be a book against guns and knives, cuz now a days no one is going to rob or attack you without a weapon, nor do people fight one on one. 
 An interesting book and there will be much discussion as to whether David Healy is ultimately correct. However, what does concern me about David Healys work, is that it is basically negative. If he believes that S.S.R.I.sare in many cases worse than placebo, what is he advocating in their place? It is well understood that anti-depressants along with the various counselling therapies, can prove very effective.  In Doctor Healys local authority however, there is a 9 month waiting list to see a psychologist. Is David Healy advocating and campaigning for more psychologists in his work-place?  In the future, new drugs will have less and less relevance. It is becoming far too expensive to continue to develop and test them. There has to be an alternative.  2 of the most beneficial are:  MEDITATION and HEALING With the right tools anyone can practice both with amazing results and nil side-effects.  IT IS TIME RIGHT NOW FOR EVERYONE TO WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE1111  
 Wendy Doniger has done a disservice to an important Hindu work. She has misinterpreted the work in important passages.   Poor showing Wendy 
 Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat provides a rather feeble excuse for her limited bibliography and fails to provide adequate citations for many of her assertions. There is an obvious French slant on history throughout the book. And in some cases there appear to be insertions of "local legends" or Francophile dreams for which there is no other evidence than Toussaint-Samat's statement (i.e., fabricated quotations attributed to Charlemagne's biographer in the cheese story on pages 116-117 - look it up!). In a generalized, broad-spectrum work such as this it would be all but impossible to check every fact. But, that being said, the book contains hundreds if not thousands statements of fact and her uncritical (at best!) inclusion of information for which there is no evidence in the source cited brings the whole book, as an authoritative source, into question 
 Music doesn't get any nastier than CRUNK JUICE. One of the most unusual tracks, a Rick Rubin collaboration, samples Slayer instrumentals with Jon and his East Side Boyz (who are never actually identified on the CD) screaming over them to create what may be the first-ever crunk/blues/metal hybrid in the history of rock & roll. Other songs interweave middle-eastern rhythms, soulful vocal arrangements, vivid call-and-response energy, ADD-poster-child screeching, and occasional delicate strings over Miami bass lines, electronica, and punk-rock ambiance. Chris Rock provides filthy-but-funny spoken-word cameos; Usher, Ludacris, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, R. Kelly, and Lil John protï¿½gï¿½ Lil Scrappy comprise only a partial list of featured helpers.  It's a testament to CRUNK JUICE'S musical integrity that the album holds up despite lyrics that, in addition to being extremely vulgar, are not especially brilliant--or even funny. What seems like it ought to sound like an immature mish-mosh of styles and performers holds together instrumentally as a terrific dance record. If only the lyrics were in a language no one could understand, we'd really have something wonderful here.   I really don't see what people get out of someone screaming the same words over and over again. Is this really what rap music has become today? Come on! 
 Professor Yoo's writing style is as nearly befuddled and confused as his understanding of a Constitutional law.  I can say without fear of contradiction that this is by far one of the most ill-conceived, unsubstantive  and pointless books I have ever had the misfortune to read.  His theories and assertions are never clearly backed up with any real documentation or legal reasoning and he fails miserably in making any clear or concise point.  I feel this book was nothing more that a total waste of time. Perhaps Professor Yoo should stick to writing legal arguments, where style and in his case substance, don't really matter. 
 I was very disappointed in this book. I was a foreign language teacher for many years, and even I was put off by the use of technical grammar explanations! I bought this for an 11-year-old girl who is fascinated by manga, hoping to interest her in Japanese language learning.  This was definitely not the book for such a purpose -- its description should make it more clear that this is not a book for young learners 
 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 ...because that's all this magazine is: an advertising vehicle aimed at kids who aren't old enough to discriminate between ads and actual content yet.   Don't be fooled by the venerable "National Geographic" name: this publications pays only the briefest lip service to educational content. When my son received it as a gift I was shocked to see that the ads were virtually indistiguishable from the articles. And in fact, the ads were often much more visually interesting.   The photos were excellent, I must admit. But the layout was jazzed up to the point of absurdity, as if designed to play to kids with minuscule attention spans. The science facts were sound, but again, the articles were cut absurdly short, more like squibs and factoids than actual articles, as if the editors believe that kids couldn't possibly focus on one topic long enough to actually read more than 250 words about it...or maybe because they didn't want to distract the kids from all that tantalizingly lucrative advertising stuffed onto every page.  As an editor and a parent, I am appalled by this magazine and would not recommend it to anyone. National Geographic should be ashamed of itself for pushing this kind of junk on young readers. Avoid this publication like the plague. 
 I couldn't believe that I bought this crap. I didn't learn anything from this book. It has so little content. Most of the book is an appendix listing the stocks on the Nasdaq. This is most likely an attempt to make money from the day trading craze. I bought this because of the last few glowing recommendations but  they must have been paid to write it. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. There are better ones out there that provides better details on day trading 
 Note to soundtrack producers: When we buy a soundtrack with a bunch of good songs, we want to hear the songs. Sure, a bunch of dialog scattered throughout is fine and fun, but not when it's cut into the music! (See the soundtrack to "Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back" for how to do it right.)  Basically, what they've done here, is try to create some new experience that isn't quite the movie and isn't quite the soundtrack. You don't get to hear the full versions of the songs as the artists recorded them. The beginnings and the ends are crossfaded together with snippets of dialog. It's like a soundtrack/radio drama hybrid with no plot. The dialog runs into the song, which runs into the dialog, which runs into the song, which runs into the dialog, etc., throughout the entire CD. On the first listen, you think, "Oh, yeah, Ed complaining that the zombie blew the call-and-response in 'White Lines.' That was funny...," but then you're kind of screwed for the rest of your life because the editors have mixed in the boys doing their, "...diggeda, diggeda, diggeda..." bit right into the middle of the song. If you truly want to hear 'White Lines' or any of the other tunes, you'll have to get them elsewhere. Sorry.   I'm not sure what the objective was with this disc, but if I wanted to relive the movie, I'd pop in the DVD. If I wanted to hear the songs, I would have liked to have played the CD, but that won't work here. The songs and the movie dialog on this CD are like Siamese twins sharing a single stomach. You get one, you get the other and there's no separating them. This is a bummer since they're good songs.   What I've got now is a CD novelty that I really can't use. I may trot it out once a year, but I'll be disappointed every time. Maybe I'll sell it on eBay.. 
 This book is apparently not well researched and has at least three errors so far and I am not a fifth finished with it.  For one on page 71: "After signing the treaty, (The Treaty of Alliance between the United States and France) Franklin, Deane, and Adams were officially presented to the king..."  Unger means Arthur Lee, not Adams.  The treaty was signed on February 6, 1778, the presentation ceremony was March 22.  John Adams didn't arrive in Paris until April 8.  This is pitiful and I could list the other errors and I certainly will if it is requested.  But I resent the time involved to do it, they are not my errors!  Why the Library Journal claims this is a "well-researched" biography one can only speculate.  The (few?) errors make the whole suspect.  A sad event for publishing.  Perhaps we should wait another 20 years for an accurate book 
 T.H.U.G.S. is an okay album but it just doesn't have anything that can give it that extra push. NOT RECOMMENDED 
 Anyone interested in Barber's life and/or music should seek out the amazing bio by Barbara Heyman, Samuel Barber - The Composer and his Music (Oxford U. Press). As a lifelong student of the career & music of Barber, I was appalled to read this book by Felsenfeld. It is FILLED with inaccuracies, half-truths, ambiguities, and similarly misleading statements. And was there ANY attempt at editing the ms? It is likewise filled with errors in usage, punctuation, even vocabulary. The Britten section is equally poor. The recorded music on the attached cd does not fairly represent the composers, either - it's all from the "middle period" of each man and does not properly represent either composer's stylistic breadth. The concept of a brief book introducing these composers to the lay listener, with listening excerpts provided in the package, is a fine one, which makes it doubly sad that a golden opportunity has been botched. If I could give this item "zero stars" or maybe a minus number, I would. AVOID THIS ONE! 
 I stopped reading after the first two stories.  Intriguing ideas for a short story collection, and great cover, but poorly executed. The writing is not engaging - at times convoluded and cofusing - and no real connection with the characaters or their plights.  The dialogue seemed contrived, and I found myself thinking that people don't really speak the way characters did in this book.  Granted, I only made it through 88 pages, but I was comfortable in using that as a prediction for the rest.  I'm with a lot of other reviewers here - I don't quite understand all the praise/awards for this work.  Now, for much more engaging and genius short story writing, check out KELLY LINK.  Especially MAGIC FOR BEGINNERS. Nearly perfect.  Also, MOTHERS AND OTHER MONSTERS, by Maureen F. McHugh.  What short stories should be.  I'll be selling Twilight back to my bookseller.  I wonder if the author would be more engaging with essay writing 
 As a strong proponent of attachment parenting and a rather radical unschooler, this book was a BIG disappointment!!! I bought this book after reading the reviews and wish I hadn't paid more than $1 for it. While the title "The Unprocessed Child" accurately describes Laurie's upbringing, this book shouldn't be grouped with other unschooling literature. The author, while cherishing the close bond she has with her daughter, reminds me of the mother in "Love You Forever" who sneaks across town and climbs into her grown son's room at night to spend time with him--sweet but a bit creepy. The fact that she admits that she even went to college at the same time as her daughter so she could spend more time with Laurie pretty much says it all. The mother clearly has her own issues that I hope she allows herself to work through and heal from now that she's not spending 24/7 with her only child. We have been unschooling each of our four children since birth --challenging temperments and all--and I feel very privileged to spend so much time with them as they discover how exciting it is to decode and discover the world around them. If you want to read a GOOD book about unschooling without unsupported platitudes and preaching in almost every chapter, I would recommend "Homeschooling our Children, Unschooling Ourselves". Those authors offer more balance and eloquence than Ms. Fitzenreiter. 
 This film was very confusing and boring.  The dark tone of the scenery was depressing - hard to follow, I really think this should have been either colorful for an audience of children or more graphic for an adult audience.  It's almost like the director wasen't sure which audience he wanted to please and doing so didn't please either one.  Skip it 
 I read "Gettysburg".  I listened to "Grant Comes East", an unabridged version on tape.  I enjoyed the first.  On a positive note, I got so excited during the Confederate attack on Washington that I almost wrecked my car.  But.  The alternate plot of Gettysburg is feasible but the farther time passes from July 1st, the more difficult it is to accept the authors' projection of alternate history.  The idea of moving the Army of the Tennessee to Pennsylvania and putting them into almost immediate offensive action is asserting a near impossibility.  That Army was virtually inactive, under Grant and Sherman, from July until the battles around Chattanooga in November.  They were as exhausted by victory as Pemberton's men were by defeat.  The rescue of Washington by the 54th Massachussets is a tip of the hat to political correctness.  The authors portray them as battle-hardened veterans.  As of that time (prior to their assault on Ft. Wagner), the unit had no combat experience.  Except for his raid into "the hollow shell" of the Confederacy, Col. Grierson's career had been unremarkable.  It is difficult to believe that his men could have been transported to Pennsylvania, mounted on new, unfamiliar horses, and been a match for Wade Hampton.  I don't plan to read the third book of the trilogy.  My son began reading it and was so turned off that he didn't finish it.  This could have been a great series but I think that Newt (whom I admire as a political strategist) lost his courage about half way through Grant Comes East and stopped pursuing his Confederate victory at Gettysburg to its logical conclusion 
 I admit I don't know who Chris Maddon is but I liked the idea of this book so I bought it. I've gone back and forth through it but have never determined yet what exactly is new about these rooms. It looks like a simple collection of living rooms without rhyme or reason.  I expect a lot more from a book than that and a lot more obvious effort on the part of the author in making me understand the point of the book and what ideas are in it for me 
 I am getting rid of this book. I followed the recipes exactly but got very poor results. The eclair batter was too thin--the eclairs were flat and impossible to fill. The pastry cream recipe should be called "pastry sauce"--also thin, never set up. The almond paste pound cake recipe fell. The white cake recipe had a very nice texture but shrinks a great deal as it cools. Overall I was very disappointed with this book. It gave me the worst results of any cookbook I have tried in recent memory 
 Most difficult to read.  A heavy subject made all the heavier by the author's approach of writing this book as 1) a two-semester course on the subject delivered by a graduate student delivering prepared text and/or 2) a doctoral disertation not edited for reading; but rather to be used as footnotes in someone else's disertation on a similar subject.  Almost unbearable 
 I LOVE Elizabeth Berg.  While this book was not her best, the story of the people about whom this was written was really amazing.  I just felt the book was boring, and I think it lacked Berg's wonderful prose and poetry on life.  I think she made one reference to life being like fabric on a sewing machine, slipping out of your fingers, or something like that.  I always love her comparisons like that, and this book did not contain much where I said "Wow - she is SO right!"  I also don't like books from a child's point of view.  I'm 41 and want to read from a woman's point of view.  If this is your first Elizabeth Berg book, do yourself a favor and go read something older by her.  She really is wonderful, and I look forward to her next novel 
 I bought this after reading reviews on the oxo travel mug.  Many said it kept things very warm for a long period of time.  My experience is to the contrary.  I've sealed the lid as tightly as I can, and I may get a decently warm drink for 30 minutes or so...The only accurate information I did get is that it doesnt spill!!!  Hope this helps 
 It is not my intent to write an unhelpful, "bashing" review.  I have a decade of management experience, and this simply is not a good book.  Why?  Well, the great religions of the world use short parables to teach lessons, and this book also operates in parable form (the people and situations in the book are made up).  Instead of delivering the message of the book in one or two paragraphs in order to teach the lesson, which is entirely possible for the lesson being taught, the lesson is drug out for about 180 pages with the express purpose of selling books and delivering a feel good message.  Many of the other reviewers here who also did not like the book point to many worthwhile references that I will not repeat here.  Overall, the lessons in this book are equivilant to those learned in a a high school Introduction to Business class. 
 I read this book.  I read it about two weeks ago.  Sometimes I would read it at my desk.  The lamp on my desk shone on the book.  If you enjoyed that style of  writing - which I call "laundry list style" - you would get into this book.  Short choppy sentences abound!  That's not the only problem here, some sentences aren't sentences but a dependent clause.  Here is one from page 11, "Once we were leaving a movie theater after seeing a pretentious movie."  It is also hard to follow this book at times due to the quick switching of gears/scenes.  I feel that no flow ever develops.  I could care less about the characters, no drama or suspense is ever built and the writing lacks.  Instead of Veronica buy a harmonica.  Even if you never learn to play well it will be better than this book.  
 What sort of racist trash is this? As an Asian, I was extremely insulted by the occasional racial slurs against Asians in this book. Chinese people like nothing better than eating dogs? Japanese men are still saying outdated sexist things like "Men know better, women no listen?" I stopped reading after the first few chapters, which I only read because I was bored out of my mind. I'm a big fan of chick lit, but even I thought it was pretty damn bad writing. Sex and the City may have gained fame by being incorporated into a TV series, but that doesn't have anything to do with Bushnell's writing skills--it's just about the plot. Yet another brainless book by a talentless hack 
 Nice package (as usual with HRR) but articles are VERY outdated (late '90). I do not recommend it 
 Ive read mixed reviews on this book and though i had to make my own mind up. I first bought the book, 120pages later i realised that i had no clue what was going on, so i bought the audiobook (5 hours later i was still thinking what the hell is going on).  Now im stephen kings No1 fan and have loved the majority of his work, the talisman for me was a fantastic bolt on to the dark tower quest. So naturally i thought this would be the same. The book is one of the slowest drawn out books ive ever came accross, not a patch on previous work. I forced myself through the book expecting more, and im sorry to say this one doesnt deliver on any horror, excitment etc, do yourself a favour, get a tin of paint and watch it dry - more happens in that and at a much quicker pace than it does in this book. This book is for die hard fans only... but even diehards will find this a chore 
 I couldn't believe that I bought this crap. I didn't learn anything from this book. It has so little content. Most of the book is an appendix listing the stocks on the Nasdaq. This is most likely an attempt to make money from the day trading craze. I bought this because of the last few glowing recommendations but  they must have been paid to write it. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. There are better ones out there that provides better details on day trading 
 I had high hopes for this one, in preparation for teaching a course on research methods.  I found the discussion entirely too abstract -- odd, given Becker's insistence that he would use examples to illustrate his points.  There are some intriguing discussions, but much of what I found was not terribly useful 
 This scope is not a good starter scope for anyone interested in astronomy.  Here's why:  1.  The objective is too small, only 60 mm, 2.36 inches, so it is too small to bring in the light necessary for even a beginning look at the universe.  I suppose it is adequate for the moon, but that is it.  The planets will appear as very small disks.  One will be able to see Saturn's rings, but the image will be very small.  Forget it for deep sky objects, clusters, galaxies, etc.    2.  The mount is an altazimuth, which will not follow the celestial object in the sky.  The earth is rotating, and anyone focusing on a star or moon will quickly find the object drifting out of the field of vision.  A better mount is an equatorial mount which makes it much easier to track objects.    3.  The 4mm eyepiece is too powerful for this scope.  The observer will find it hard to look through (very small eye opening), and will in most cases cause blurred images.  The 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece.  The barlow is a 3x, which again is too poweerful for this scope.    4.  The mount will vibrate when touched, which will cause the image in the eyepiece to "shiver", which is very frustrating.    Even for the low price, don't be enticed by this scope; it has too many flaws. Save your money for a larger scope with a better mount.    Jim "Konedog" Koenig, astronomy buf 
 I haven't received this product yet and I'm pretty upset about it. I've requested that someone contact me about this problem and I haven't been given an answer.  I think I'm deserving of some sort of discount or at least an answer.   Where is the product I bought??? 
 Just to clarify the music... These tracks come from the first two albums of the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem.  They are called "Rising of the Moon" and "Come Fill Your Glass With Us"  These tracks were recently reissued on Rykodisc, restored and remastered.  Frankly, they sound AMAZING!  This complation has terrible sound quality, and the recordings sound like they were copied from an old LP.  Don't settle for this ugly sounding reissue, go and check out the remastered versions.  Unless you are on a serious budget, get the other discs.  Combined, they cost about twice what this costs, but IT IS WORTH IT 
 Despite the some edition problems and the presence of lagoons in the script, the story retains its interest. A disturbed woman in his early twenties, who has suffered sexual abuse of his own father and maltreats of his husband finds casually, a man in the middle of the road who eventually will help to dig in her life and face her demons.          
 The book presents translation theory and information on the history of translation.  It lists proverbs with their translations as well as cognates and false cognates.  There's humorous examples of bad translations.  Therefore, after reading it, you will know how to evaluate the quality of a translation without having been given much practice in translating.  If you're looking for a book on translation theory, this will be a fine introduction.  It isn't as good if you need to learn to translate 
 While this book contains a ton of data, don't get it if you want calorie counts on anything homemade.  If you look up french toast, for example, it only gives information on name brand items.  Much of the information in the book is available on the packaging of the products.  I suppose that if you wanted to check it before shopping, or use it before eating out, it would be helpful.  But if you want to find out the caloric content of any homemade items, you are out of luck with this book 
 Rebbeca's bs.  no contents.  how can a person write a book this boring? I won't buy any books by Rebecca Saunders in the future 
 I had very high hopes for this cream, as it appears they went the extra mile for quality. Not so. The cream when used leaves alot of friction as the razor goes over your face, making for some tense moments that should not be there. I have used many creams. So far Art of Shaving is the best. Casswell Massey is ok as is Aveda. Avoid Truefitt.  Update.  Trufitt and Hill accepted the return and we spoke about the problems. They sent me a new updated extra fine version that should be available to the public now that is of the same quality as Massey. It is good. The standard is still substandard 
 This book was published in the year 1962. I wonder if it needs to be updated to be accurate and to take into account discoveries since 1962 
 I bought this title after looking and looking at many reviews for Italian cookbooks. I have made 5-6 recipes and cannot rave about even one 
   So the first thing you need to know about this movie is that it sucks. It really does. I'm not sure who their military consultant was, but if Samuel L. has Specialist pins on his collars, you don't call him Sargeant. Women aren't allowed in the Rangers (Nunez), not my rules ladies, Colonel Styles looks a little young to be a colonel (even for the Army), the Army doesn't issue tiger stripe BDU's (Mueller), the list goes on and on. This may not seem that important, but if you're gonna make a movie about the Army, you could at least get some very BASIC (soory, could't resist) things correct.      Yes, it's true that there are many twists and turns in this 'plot', but all that really means, at least in this case, is that they can multiply a weak and thin screenplay. Hey, if we tell the same story a couple different ways, it makes the story really interesting, right? Not so much. Oh, and that scene where "Specialist" West is standing on top of that shack with his pancho blowing like a villains cape? Wow, who decided that was a good idea? I don't want to ruin the ending for you, because there's no point in even seeing this movie, and anyone with enough brain cells to operate the remote will figure out the 'finale' long before it makes its belated arrival. By the way, how do you follow someone in an Army Humvee w/out them knowing? Seriously. Please spend these 90 or minutes talking with your kid's, reading a book, excercising, writing a review... I dunno, something worthy of your precious time. You've been warned.  By the way, Connie Nielsen looks hot w/ short red hair 
 While musically James McMurtry has talent, the message of his album and especially the hit song "We Can't Make It Here"  is outdated and unrealistic. In the song McMurtry laments about shirts being made in Singapore and the problems of outsourcing jobs, among other ridiculous things. It seems he would like to live in the world of the 1950s. While appealing on the surface, it is a waste of time to think like this.   McMurtry should realize that oursourcing is a reality and American companies have no choice. Nor is this a new issue. Shirts being made in Singapore? Give me a break -- he should find a real cause to wail against, not one that was lost years ago 
 This is not a good product.  My son picked it out at the toy store to spend his Christmas money.  We got it home and it wasn't at all what he expected.    It works just like a View Master, except that you need to hold the toy directly at a light in order to see the pictures on the little discs.  Even a brightly lit room is not enough, you really need to hold it next to a sunny window, or a light bulb.  This is a toy that you would expect to find in a fast-food kid's meal.  We returned this to the store the next day, and he picked out something different.  If you're looking for a Ben 10 Omnitrix watch, I would highly recommend the Omnitrix F/X Watch.  That is a great product 
 Bishop Spong is very interesting, instead of attacking conservatives he attacks Christ Himself.  The sad thing is for all the good points he has unless you reimagine faith (or lack of faith) like him, you can easily discount his ideas and some of the true things he says.  He is an important figure, not because of his scholarship which is laughable... he is important because he does prompt discussion and challenges the complacent. 
 Doll Revolution has one major flaw.  Only a few of the songs showcase Susanna Hoffs on lead vocals.  (I love to hear her sing.)  If you purchase this album and enjoy Hoffs' voice, you'll be left wanting more.  While I applaud the idea of trying something new, it didn't work here.  The Bangles need Hoffs on lead vocals.  It's just that simple.    
 Both of the recipes I tried were total flops.  I made the Savory Scraps on p. 55.  It is supposed to produce 9 squares from an 8 X 8 pan, but the result was a crumbly, non-cuttable mixture that I had to stir into the dog food.  The other recipe, Mutther's Day Puppy Seed Bread on p. 64 turned out burned on the edges, raw in the center, and unedible for my dog.  I pride myself in being a good cook who can follow a recipe.  I think they failed to verify their ingredient lists for these 2 recipes.  I hesitate to try any more of the recipes.  Perhaps they didn't verify the ingredient list.  My dog likes the food and the notations in the cookbook are very cute, but I think the customer should expect the recipes to turn out.    
 I was very disappointed in this selection.  Maybe a MALE football fanatic would find something appealing, but I was VERY bored!  Take me back to court, to the lawyer's office, to the judge's chambers,...just about anywhere but these bleachers!! 
 I'm a big James Woods fan and came across this movie here. I have never heard of it and it is not available at any of the video stores in my area. So I ordered it because of all the positive reviews here, but wound up turning it off in the middle. It was real long, uninteresting, and was taking too long for anything to happen. If you haven't seen this movie before, I would recommend you not buy this yet, like I did. Try checking out "Indictment" or "Dirty Pictures", two of Woods's best movies 
 The amazing part of this tragedy is that Shilits was a frequent visitor to the baths he condemns in this book even after knowing he was infected and thus infected countless other humans, directly or indirectly.  This book is good only if you view it as an example of someone blaming someone else for your own destructive behavior. While this book has become a major read for those who are into "victimhood" the sad truth is that Shilts is far more guilty than any of those he condemns in this book because he was the one who transmitted the virus, not the owners of the baths he paid money to in order to have his night of fun and ultimate death.  Shilts was sick in more ways than one when he wrote this and deserves condemnation rather than praise. Good night, killer.  
 The total absence of normative values makes for tedium, and revulsion, not for greatness.  Nor even, for that matter, for titillation.  When even father/daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference, it becomes easy to see why the French are exterminating themselves, by refusing to reproduce themselves. At the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family, the French nation will be gone in another few generations. This movie will help the viewer see why.  Sociologically and philosphically interesting, in that it epitomizes the banality of evil, and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig. Secularism is devoid of soul, and offers nothing to live for, nothing to live by. 
 I purchased this case for my DSCS90. I hate it! It is only big enough to hold the camera and nothing else. There is no handle to the case, in fact the case only has zippers and you are suppose to use the strap from the camera itself for the handle. The zippers do not stay in place and the camera can easily fall out of the case so I don't recommend doing this. Look for a better case for your new camera. 
        They were handing these books out for the parents at my old school so I decided to read it.          First of all,  Kevin Leman seems to be a very conservitive republican.  He says you should read your kids the Bible to show them that God wants them to wait until marrage for sex.  This is not called "A Guidebook for Christian Parents," so I'm sure that people of many other religions are reading this book.  Also, if kids want to have sex, parents telling them not to is not going to stop them.  If you tell them just not to do it, they will go at it anyways without any protection.           In another part of the book, he says that a divorce can cause girls to sexually mature faster.  What he is suggesting is to not get divorced.  What he did not mention, however, was the effects that fighting parents can have on children.       He seems to think that all teenagers are ashamed of their parents and will not listen to them just because it is the parents that are telling them to do things.  Can you get any more steroetypical?  I'm sure if any teen saw their parents reading a book that all it does is describe teens they would be furious.  This is because NOT ALL TEENS ARE THE SAME!!!!  Just because we are under the age of 21 does not mean we all have a little conference and plan how we are all going to act the same way and  make our parents miserable.        For the good of your children, do not buy this book.  Remember they are individuals!!!!  And just for the record, his "humor" is pathetic!         I know I am going to get negative feedback, and I understand because there are the arguments that I am only a teenager myself so I don't understand things about raising one.  But I hope that you try to understand my views because, after all, this book is about people like me 
 I am interested in succint yet exhaustive/substantive coverage of the topic for use in real-world corporate finance applications.  I found the book to be verbose and not sufficiently to the point.  The author peppers a few key insights in endless dialogue, which I find a bit tiresome.  The text could be better organized to highlight key points and provide greater substance and less fluff.  Definition of terms could be far better written even for an introductory text.  I suspect I am the wrong target audience 
 I was hoping for a beginning lesson on grooming my dog - just the basics.  This is more styling and tips, for those who are already using grooming tools and know what to do.  This would be useful for someone wanting to improve their grooming skills, but not very useful for a beginner 
 As many reviewers have indicated, this book is not nearly as good as Patterson's earlier works.  Is it possible Patterson now employs a ghost writer?  For people who enjoy thrillers, his first few books are fun. Don't bother with recent ones, though 
 There are two different ways in which this book may be rated: firstly, from the perspective of its contents, ideas, and accuracy - secondly, from the perspective of being an interesting read. On both accounts, the books scores one star at best.    As far as content is concerned, the main idea of this book revolves around the frustration the author has carried from her teenage years into adulthood in terms of her lack of financial resources to have what other teenagers had. Throughout the first chapters, the author vomits her anger for not being able to have and wear the labels her cool friends had and wore. This can only be described as resentment - she was not making a choice; rather, she could not access what she wanted. The rest of the book is dedicated to criticizing what marketing does, which is undertanding the needs and wants of consumers. From this perspective, we may also argue that businesses are trying to satisfy a demand, and that consumers are willing to pay a premium for having such demands met. However, the author pushes a left-wind agenda and interprets such a marketing approach as "exploiting" consumers. From then on, the books delves into a never ending tirade.    The second perspective this books may be analysed from is one of entertaining value. The books also scores a "fail" - in the pursuit of relent criticism, the topics are analysed in a very boring fashion.    Prospective readers trying to read some sensasionalistic, tabloid-style discourse are better served by getting Noami Klein, of Germaine Greer, or any other left-wing, socialist writer - at least, those authors write more stylish and fashionable nonsensical garbage.    
 I was eager to see this movie, having loved the original "American Werewolf" movie; but was sadly disappointed.  I didn't care at all for the characters, the humor was missing completely and generally it stank up the screen.  Mark me off if you don't agree - I know you rude lot will anyway - but that's my story and I'm sticking to it 
 THE SOUND IS BAD. I HAVE TRIED THIS DVD ON 2 DIFFERENT PLAYERS AND IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE 
 I am glad I purchased my Cardscan 700, but there are some significant unfortunate missed opportunities and because of that some important functions cannot be done at all.  My impression is that this is the best product on the market, due to its scanning properties, which are quite good.  There are some serious deficiencies though in the rest of the software which would be nice to have fixed, and which in some cases render the device somewhat useless, since the output cannot be transferred to a useful place.  PROs: It does a pretty good job of scanning.  The algorithm is well developed and is actually quite impressive.  Even cards that catch and rotate as they go through, producing a funny smeared image, have some of their contents scanned correctly.  The superiority of this recognition software is the strong point of this product.  There is also an ok database management product that one can use to maintain and look up cards.  Operationally the product is especially nice- I can just sit there feeding cards in and typing carriage return after each one, glancing at the screen to catch errors.  The card image is retained in the record in the Cardscan database, which is important.   CONs: 1) the exit path has places that cards can hang up, and they can catch as they go through.  This happens fairly often unless the card is new and flat, so part of the operation is to try to prevent that, by straightening out bent corners ahead of time, and by adding a little force keep the card from catching and rotating as one corner goes forward and the other is stuck.  Quite needless- if the exit path was smooth and continuous, this wouldn't happen - the problem is in the rear of the plastic case.  2) Although the product retains the image of the business card, there's no way to pass that through to Outlook or export it to any other format.  This is very unfortunate.  I could laboriously do that by hand by cutting and pasting each one, except that Cardscan software does not permit copy / paste functions on the image.  Why not?  It's easy to implement.  3) Every time I start the program it harasses me about registering, even though I've been specific that I do not wish to.  It also harasses me about logging in the online backup facility even though I've asked it not to do that.  It therefore ignores the user wishes.  4) The data exchange function allows only extremely crude export to a file, in a simple text or csv format.  There is no way to create an Outlook format .pst file, which would simplify importing, and allow for the future option of including an image.  Outlook can hold an image in the comment section of the record, but apparently Cardscan folks aren't even close to thinking about this.  5) If I indicate that a data export for a file is destined for Outlook, the field names are not set up correctly, so unless I do some heavy editing of field names, nothing much other than the contact name gets across.  If I export directly to the running Outlook program, it isn't perfect, but it's close enough to be usable.  Why did Cardscan get one right and not the other??  In neither case can I send the card image over.  6) I was forced to install Microsoft .NET software even though I intended to do all my exports via files.  I didn't get a choice- if I didn't install .NET, the installer stopped and exited without installing any Cardscan software. 
 I happened to hear my little brother listening to Welcome to Bucketheadland one day and I was very intrigued.  That song is great.  Great melody, awesome guitar riffage, quality musicianship, and a nice solo at the end.  I thought the voice over stuff was kinda gay, but what the heck, I went out and bought the album anyways, especially after reading on here about how awesome it is.  Well let me tell you, it pretty much sucks.  First of all, I'm not a fan of the music-nerd genre of rock.  By music-nerd I mean the stuff that people pretend to like because the musicians are "so amazing".  They really don't like it, but they figure that by telling people that they do, others will assume that they're on a higher plane of musical knowledge.  This stuff is so off-the-wall and abstract that you have to be partially challenged to be able to listen to it for more than a few minutes.  I had friends in my music theory classes that would have eaten this stuff up, and for the life of me, I could never figure out why.  I have dedicated well over half of my life to studying and playing music, and I cannot for any reason, see any value in this stuff.  There are, of course, the select few that will love this, and I mean no insult to those who do, it's just that I just probably don't get it.  The, ummmmm, humor? on the album is just as off-the-wall, I really don't get that either.  The only thing I can figure is that it must be a bunch of inside jokes between the band members or something.  Like I said, Welcome to Bucketheadland is quite a kick ass song, but the rest of it is unlistenable to me.  Definately listen to this, don't just go out and buy it like I did 
 While this book contains a ton of data, don't get it if you want calorie counts on anything homemade.  If you look up french toast, for example, it only gives information on name brand items.  Much of the information in the book is available on the packaging of the products.  I suppose that if you wanted to check it before shopping, or use it before eating out, it would be helpful.  But if you want to find out the caloric content of any homemade items, you are out of luck with this book 
 Great set of songs, poorly sung.  Very slow.  I wonder if the artists who sung on this CD want you to hear what they recorded?  It certainly is not them at their best 
 Good introductory text, with structured presentation. Needs more challenging case studies and exercises 
 This book was basically not thought out very well. For example, on page 154 he states that, "While the Soviet Union has collapsed, communism is not dead. It has been repackaged under a new name: environmentalism. Communism is about extensive government regulation and control by elites and so is environmentalism." I agree. It was the outstanding environmental caring of the Soviet Union that lead it to dump radioactive waste into the Bering Sea. It was concern for the environment that made the USSR drain the Aral Sea(despite protest from environmentalists everywhere.). It was the Greens(Reds is outdated according to him)that devastated the forests of Siberia and nearly made the Siberian tiger extinct. If we are communists,then why do communist countries have the worst environmental records in the world( Siberia is the most polluted region on Earth.)? If the above isn't enough, lets look at some other claims. He tries to say that we don't need a national health care plan because it will limit our freedom. Assuming this is true, there are other things to think about. Like the fact that 40 million people lack health care coverage at all. 100 million more people lack adequate health care coverage. Many people I know don't have health coverage. They suffer while he talks about liberty. Wouldn't it be better to sacrifice some liberty to ensure that these peoples needs are being met? I think so. One last example. He claims that the minimum wage raises corporate costs and causes them to fire employees. Therefore he wants to repeal it. But he said so himself, corporations want to reduce costs. Therefore if the minimum wage is eliminated people already struggling to make ends meet will be walloped with lower wages and even those with with high wages will see there incomes fall. And he claims to be for common sense. This is far-right propaganda. I don't see how he claims or appears to think that he is a libertarian when he is so blatantly a Republican. I give this a 2 star review because it does give a interesting view of the right-wing libertarian mindset, but if it weren't for that I would give it a 1 star review. There is nothing revolutionary in this book, and you will not learn anything new, so save your money. If you must have this message though, read Larry Elder. It is the same message, and from the cover picture of his book you can see that Elder has nicer teeth 
 I'm sorry...I've enjoyed some of Kathryn Caskie's books, but not this one! The beginning just made me groan! It began with a silly scene and I admit things improved but only slightly. This is a plot-driven book...rich characterization is completely missing. There is no depth to any relationship in the book. The premise (3 fraternal triplets are secret princesses...it was difficult to accept triplets each with different colored hair) of this book is as implausible as the plot itself. As the denouement approaches, the hero and heroine are married by a bogus vicar but they don't know that. The unmarried couple (although they think they are legally married) takes off to find the vicar to see if he can somehow nullify the wedding as if that were even legally possible. England had laws in the 1800s which would preclude a vicar being able to do that. And surely a duke would be aware of this but he acts just as foolishly as the heroine. Anyway, this is just another silly plot device that's representative of this book. I suppose it's meant to be a light-hearted romp but I just found it inane and irritating! 
 Simple ideas.  Was not very useful for my work environment. I was looking for something that was a little different or unusual that we haven't tried 
 Jodie Foster is excellent but there is no doubt that the daughter will be found on the plane at the end. The only mystery is in the details. No real suspense. I found the plot to be a little farfetched 
 But ... maybe this book is required after all.  I mean, the last 3 books were written as if Stephen King threw in whatever ridiculous thought popped into his mind, so maybe we do need this to explain what the hell he was thinking!  One reviewer wrote in his review that this book is NEEDED, not something that you just want, so I guess I may be on the right track after all.  Now that I look closer, I see that this lofty Concordance was published in 2003, which means that it only focuses on the 1st 4 books.  Ah, the good old days, when the Dark Tower series seemed so good and before King's creativity was knocked out of his head when he was hit by a van.  It's true, you know - just compare the 1st four books to the last three and you'll se what I mean 
 This was probably one of my most favorite books when I was young.  I remember my mother reading it to me and how wonderfully Mr. Grahame captured the countryside and the wonderful characters.  All memorable!   But now we come to this one.  A totally beautifully illustrated rendition it is (though it really is hard in my mind to beat Ernest H. Shepard's wonderful Rat, Badger, Toad and all!).  The reason for the 1 star is two fold.  One, it's an abridged version.  Yes, I know it's for consumption by younger folk.  I was, however,  maybe 4 or 5 when it was first read to me.  Why do we continue to sell our children short?  The biggest reason though for the poor rating is that several chapters have been left out.  The one I have always loved the best is "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn."  A beautiful tale of heroism, compassion, and love.  It's not in this edition.  An outrage!  I will NOT buy this book and I will certainly NOT recommend it to others 
 This book was readable and somewhat compelling in that I wanted to know what would happen next.  However, the narrative was ridiculous in its depiction of the character's lives.  A UCLA professor who seems to have all kinds of free time for attending events with her famous movie star husband?  It reinforces the stereotype of college professors having an easy job that doesn't require any more time than giving lectures (with apparently no preparation), going on sabbatical whenever they feel like it, and traveling to exotic places to do research.  That was just one of the silly descriptions in this very silly book.  I had to work to suspend my disbelief long enough to finish it.  It was like watching a soap opera - a guilty pleasure 
 I have yet to finish this book; however, for the portions I have already read, I am not impressed. To begin, his expanded usage of the English language is unnecessary for the simplicity of his context. He also has multiple run on sentences that can be as long as 64 words! Also, "his" concepts are more or less variances of colorations of others theory's. The first half of the book is lofty, very wordy and lacking clear definitions. Perhaps this may be a test to see if I can Engage in learning.   Also to gain my credit I am a student of new media including Flash and have read multiple books based on learning through interactivity 
 I am a fan of weird cult and experimental films but El Topo becomes tedious after a while. It was one of the original "midnight movies" and probably worked better in that setting. El Topo (more interesting for its imagery than plot) comes off as a stoned, somewhat campy film highly derivative of Luis Bunuel, Arrabel (Viva La Muerte) and is similar to the early experimental films of Werner Herzog (Even Dwarves Started Small, Fata Morgana). That said if you've heard of all these films and are in the mood for a surrealistic, sacreligious western that drags on for a long time, then El Topo has its moments 
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
    The New York State Consumer Protection Board didn't issue a scathing 25 page document on Lesko for nothing.     Much of the "free" money is stuff like food stamps, low income housing assistance, Medicare, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., etc.    There are plenty of serious publications out there that will list money available for scholarships, business loans and other serious enterprises.      Readers looking for information on "big discounts" for government cars will find out about auctions of vehicles confiscated from drug dealers and tax cheats. "Free car repairs" turn out to be government mandated auto recalls. "10% off your restaurant bill" is going to early bird special at a local eatery.      If these books aren't fraud, they are damn close.      Cavaet Emptor.  
 As a musician I appreciate Feinstein's "carrying the torch" if you will for this genre if music. This CD has pretty well soured me on his more recent work. After "Forever" he seemed to make some  fundamental changes to his approach and performance of this style of music.  For my tastes, it's not working like his earlier releases did. Too much  production, odd interpretations, and a sense of trying things almost for  the sake of trying them... When Feinstein is on his game, he's likely the  best going, but lately he's not "got game"...spend your money on  a Harry Connick,Jr. CD...you'll have a lot more fun.. 
 "South By Java Head" is the kind of book you might enjoy more if you just had a bitter breakup with your Japanese girlfriend.  The Japanese are the villains, of course, it being World War II and the protagonists a group of mixed civilians and English military personnel escaping Singapore a half-step ahead of Tojo's Army, but this 1958 effort by Alistair MacLean was written well before the advent of political correctness, and its racism is not only troubling but actually a detriment to the thin story.  Meet the lead villain, Col. Kiseki. As described by a Javanese villager, "Colonel Kiseki is not human. He is an animal, a jungle animal. But the jungle animals kill only when they have to. Kiseki would tear the arm off a man - or a little child - as a thoughtless child would pull the wings off a fly."  Later, we meet one of Col. Kiseki's grinning underlings, who assures us his prisoners will be tortured before they are killed because "the strong have no need" of international conventions. Special treatment will be dished out to the female nurses, he adds.  Yes, the Japanese often employed cruel tactics in World War II, but here instead of merely allowing them to be villains with the appropriate degree of intelligence and menace, MacLean turns them into savage brutes so bent on cruelty and killing that it literally causes their defeat. Meanwhile, the protagonists whose story we doggedly follow from one mess to the next seem done in or saved by odd spells of luck, both bad and good, rather than their own devises, about which little is clear in this convoluted narrative.  I only docked the book one star for racism; it's otherwise terrible enough. MacLean served up many cardboard characters and cheap plot twists in his career, but here, in only his third novel, and following the two classics "H.M.S. Ulysses" and "The Guns Of Navarone," he seems to be serving up a foretaste of his worst writing to come.  It's a shame because MacLean's plot idea is unique, a refugee ship trying to make safe landfall, and the opening chapter describing Singapore under siege just hours before the Japanese takeover is a good example of MacLean at his descriptive, Conradian best. But it all falls to pieces quickly as MacLean loads up his story with secret documents, double agents, traitors, and bad romantic subplots, not to mention so much pain and anguish as the party comes under repeated attack from the Japanese and the elements that you almost wish they would just capsize their craft and be done with it.  I love reading MacLean books, even the rockier later ones, because of his craft and his wit. But this was a painful read for me on many counts, and the hardest of his books to get through. Unless you're a completist (like me), give it a miss 
 After multiple shopping excursions leave her captivated with Amish dolls and quilts, affluent American Sue Bender attempts to impose herself on an Amish family in order to use their community as a personal spiritual retreat. The result was a pseudo-spiritual "journey" that gave rise to this short, self-indulgent, ethnocentric work.  Needless to say that Sue Bender is not an ethnographer (she is, we are repeatedly reminded, an artist), and PLAIN AND SIMPLE is not an ethnography. However, in between vapid musings, Bender squeezes in a few pages (about 40% of the book) recounting some of the experiences she had while living with two Amish families for a few months. This is the part of the book that's actually interesting. During her stay, Bender even manages to cast-off a few of her prejudgments and sterotypes about the Amish people and their culture.  Although she admits that she expected a prompt spiritual revolution, her instrospectional conclusions are still tidy and conciliatory; she resolves that it is, tragically, not in her "nature" to be "calm", and then labels this epiphany as triumphant progress. Such is the depth of her revelations that she contradicts herself when describing them. Bender's pap analysis of the Amish identifies several "paradoxes". In science, the emergence of paradoxes tends to indicate a flawed theoretical model, but Sue Bender instead chooses to cling to her convenient, superficial interpretations of the multifaceted Amish ethos (which she regards as a novelty).  Having learned so much from an Amish community in Iowa, Bender proceeds to simulate the experience by remodelling her modern kitchen entirely in synthetic materials. Years later--but only a few paragraphs after comparing herself to a "Zen monk"--she finally admits that cultivating a focused, Amish-like calm might actually require some sort of inward, self-actualized change. At least that's something.  Maybe Sue Bender will grace us all with a follow-up work in which she experiences another spiritual awakening while hat-shopping in Tibet 
 If you ever read this book: Joe Sack' SQL server 2000 Fast Answers for DBA and Developer, then you will see Vieira's book misses so many details about SQL server 2000. Understanding that this book focuses on PROGRAMMING only, but still it misses many PROGRAMMING  DETAILS of SQL server 2000. I do not have no connection to Joe Sack's business. I read and compare the two and speak out my mind. 
 THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.  I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life 
 If your looking for an autobiography of someones life then this is the book for you.  But if your buying the book to learn the darvas system of the stock market then this is not the book for you.  I gave this book a 1 star rating because the book jacket said that the book contained information about nicolas darvas' system for profiting in the market.  But nowhere in this book does he give you any information about it or how to use it. It sounds like all he did was buy a stock that was in a strong uptrend and then bought it when it passed the resistance level.  Nicholas also gained most of his money when he bought a cheap stock on a wim for maybe 5 or 10 dollars and it shot up in price overnight and was restricted for anymore trading.  He ended up selling for 171 dollars a share and sold for a profit of 250,000.  His idea of buying resistance is nothing new and it sounds like he was lucky more than anything else.  
 ....for several reasons.  Apparently, the other online reviewers are extremely over-analytical in their critiques of this film.  The DVD's jacket has a quote from Rolling Stone..."Think 'Sex and the City' with men!"  Well, I say, "Think again."   As an avid watcher of "Sex and the City", this film has little if any comparison to SATC.  Firstly, this film is not a comedy.  There were very small instances when I kind of chuckled, but could barely muster a real laugh.  Actually, towards the end of the film there is so much constant screaming and fighting that I kept hitting FAST FORWARD on the remote (those of you who regularly depend on reviews for movie choices know exactly what I mean here!).  The characters are presented in a confusing fashion with only snippets and glimpses into each person's life.  These disjointed glimpses don't give the viewer time or depth to care what happens to any of the spoiled rotten characters.  Yes, they are all bored whether they are in their 30's or their 50's.  Yes, they all want to break away from the mundane by running away or having affairs.  I usually enjoy movies with this breaking-away-from-boredom type of plot for example...Pane e Tulipani (Bread and Tulips), Facing Windows (also starring Giovanna Mezzogiorno and a MUCH better film), Under the Tuscan Sun, Shirley Valentine, A Month by the Lake, etc. The Last Kiss does not deliver anything near what these other films do, however.  The viewer is left with no warm feelings about life's decisions, only a twist ending that will make you furious and sick for having spent two hours watching this film 
 IF YOU WANT TO BREAK YOUR LEASE THIS IS THE CD TO PLAY LOUD. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT RESEMBLES MUSIC GO ELSEWHERE. I DON'T MIND NOISE-ROCK WHEN THEIR IS A SEMBLENCE OF RIFF OR MELODY{SONIC YOUTH, BIG BLACK, DON CABALLERO}, BUT THIS IS JUST A WASTE OF PLASTIC. I EXPECTED MUCH BETTER FROM THESE MUSICIANS 
 Don't take my word for it that's a quote from the title of a recent post excoriating this irritating and increasingly bloated product on Slashdot.   Be warned: Adobe has not learned its lesson, and despite the outcry that followed the release of version 6, this latest release of Acrobat continues Adobe's aggressive trend of intruding into your desktop environment, again, as in version 6 without providing an easy way to undo the damage once its done--in fact, it's now nearly impossible. Like earlier releases, this version of Acrobat adds startup macros and new toolbar buttons to your existing applications and adds menu entries to your desktop "right click" menus. Adobe argues that these are conveniences, but they are entirely unnecessary (for most of us "printing" to Adobe PDF achieves the same result, is much more convenient, and a more natural model), and clutter what for most users is either a too-crowded user interface (for those who don't have the knowledge or patience to customize it) or a carefully tuned one (for those who do). Unlike many well-behaved applications that provide obvious ways of avoiding this kind of intrusive and disruptive behavior (e.g. through a simple checkbox option in a settings dialog), Acrobat's "option" for disabling this behavior, once deeply hidden in the setup process,is now almost completely absent. To disable the "Convert to Adobe PDF" button that mysteriously appears in the Outlook mail editor, for example, one has to be sure to choose "this feature will not be available" from the "Microsoft Outlook" option under "Acrobat PDFMaker" under "Create Adobe PDF". Simply deleting the button using Outlook's toolbar customization feature will not work: it comes right back when the editor is next opened. Similar problems arise in Word, Excel, Visio, Project, and Internet Explorer. And there's simply no way to get rid of the never-used "Convert to Adobe PDF" and "Combine in Acrobat..." entries in that appear in the desktop context menus for files (even if one installs none of the Acrobat PDFMaker features).   For the technically inclined wishing to repair some of the damage that Acrobat 7 does, there are complex but largely effective step by step instructions available on the web, but even the authors of these are driven to despair by version 7: ("Adobe has really pushed the boat out with Acrobat 7 and managed to screw Word royally") .   In short, Acrobat will make a mess of your working environment, there's no way to completely fix it, and even the partial fix is a pain (and not well documented). (This may seem a minor issue, but if every application followed Adobe's reckless example, our working environments would start to look like strip malls, crowded with features screaming for our attention to the point where it is hard to find what we need when we need it. One of the great strengths of the personal computer desktop is that users can configure it in ways that suit their needs; no application should interfere with that.)   Experienced Acrobat users will also notice that this version continues another frustrating trend for Acrobat (and most other Adobe applications): it is yet again slower to launch than the previous version. In fact, on my 2 GHz Pentium 4, it takes longer to launch than the entire Visual Studio .NET development environment, and longer than the boot sequence for Windows XP!   There are other minor problems as well (arbitrary rearrangements of menu and tool bar items, etc.) but these two major flaws are more than bad enough. Unless you really need the latest Acrobat features, you should probably avoid this upgrade. And if the "improvements" in this release are any indication of where Adobe plans to go with future releases, it may be time to start looking elsewhere for a tool for digital document management.   Fortunately, there's no reason at all to upgrade. Version 7 offers no usefully new features, so you can (and should) avoid this one (at all costs) 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 Any book with a character (Shirley) who repeatedly says "jeez louise" needs some serious editing. This book in no way compares to Thayer's earlier books.  I agree with the reviewer who wrote that the writing was dumbed down to suit a wider audience 
 what mr. sen fails to realize is that the common man doesn't pigeonhole muslims or anyone else because of little boxes the common man is told to place them in (from whatever author assigned and designed the little boxes). the common man pigeonholes foreigners he has no interaction with, mainly not because of some authors the common man never reads or cares about, but because of the actions of some of those who are pigeonholed. everyone knows that khwarizmi originated algebra, and that some muslim leaders in the past sheltered jews when no one else would. sadly though the relative tolerance of those muslims cannot be said to exist in mainstream to hardline muslims of today. when videos of daniel pearl's horrific and senseless murder are passed around amongst friends in saudi arabia as an honored example of the valiant muslim struggle against the mythical zionist-american world conspiracy we start to see the true depth of the problem. the problem is not america, or the west, or how these institutions see muslims or muslim countries...the problem is the hardline fundamentalists for all intents and purposes are the mouthpieces and boots of today's islam, and that is what america and the west doesn't care for. common man joe in the usa has no problem with his bangladeshi muslim immigrant neighbor, he has a problem with foreign muslims executing americans and jews. the true intolerants are not the west or america, but the hatemongers that unfortunately are too often heard and too often idolized in the muslim world. when islam moves forward light-years in reality of being comparable to the multicultural and diversity champions of the world (the west), when the average muslim would sooner turn in hatemongers and murderers rather than shelter them...only then could anyone make any valid complaints against the extremely tolerant and open minded countries of the west, if any imagined bias could be found at that point 
 i'v seen a multitude of documentaries, both low and high budget, and although i found the story interesting i felt this film was not up the hype it was given.  worth seeing, but not worth owning 
 I'm normally kind with my reviews of this type of literature.  It's not meant to be a novel of great significance - just lite entertainment.  BUT . . . this one has just a few too many holes.    It's not awful - I did finish it after all - but there were a number of negatives.  Here are the pluses and minuses, as I see them:  *1* - I was not annoyed enough to turn off the tape and stop listening.  -2- - the cast of characters tended to be a little too annoying in their "goodness" vs. "evil."  Pigeon Tony was a little "too" sweet for my taste.  Even under the given circumstances, he needed a little more grit.  -3- - As mentioned by another reviewer, what was with the 1st degree murder charge?  Can't imagine any prosecutor worth his salt pursuing anything over manslaughter, given the circumstances.  -4- - The romance angle was a little heavy-handed.  -5- - The total inaction of the authorities when Judy's life was threatened strains credibility.  Overall, I like Scottoline.  I've read several of her other novels.  This one, though, just left me feeling kind of "blah-humbug".  Here's to a better story next time 
 Sadly this second book left me unsatisfied. For one, Wouk's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second. Of course, once one has read through the first book, its hard to stop. Yet, by the end of War and Remembrance I was thoroughly sick and annoyed by Wouk's characters. It's hard to relate to super humans, who constantly do super human feats. Most of the characters in the book come from superior stock, graduate from the top universities, have extremely good looks, and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane.  I guess after spending endless hours reading the book I am somewhat frustrated. Perhaps you will be like me, and by the second book without pausing. But, for the sake of saving some time, I recommend you consider parting with the characters in book one. Don't make the mistake of buying book two just because book one was so good.          
 I was actually very disappointed with Maxted's most recent chick lit outing. Wit, humor and hilarious happenings are normally the cornerstones of Maxted's writing. Not only did I find the two main characters unsympathetic and difficult to care about, a plot obsessed with having or not having babies made for a dull read to say the least. Here's hoping she'll bring back some of the more spirited characters and occurrences in her next novel 
 This guide to culinary careers is terribly overpriced for the information it contains. The quick descriptions of different culinary careers have some value, as do the appendices listing culinary publications and organizations. However, the career descriptions are quite short and the advice is unremarkable. On the topic of finding a culinary mentor, for example, the author advises you to find one. That's pretty much it - no discussion on how to choose a suitable mentor, or how to convince an experienced professional to take you on as a protege. The book mentions the apprenticeship system but doesn't explain how to find an apprenticeship. The section on choosing a culinary school/vocational program is much better, though.  Something trumpeted in both the book description here and on both covers of the actual book is the inclusion of up-to-date information on salary statistics and earning potential for the spectrum of culinary professionals. It must have been printed in invisible ink, because I don't see it *anywhere* (and yes, I have this exact edition). This promise was my primary motivation for getting the book, so I was very disappointed (disgruntled, even) that this information is NOT in the book after all.  Don't spend money on this book unless you're just looking for a quick overview of the career possibilities. That's the one thing the author does well - it describes (in brief) a wide range of culinary careers beyond the obvious white-linen restaurant ones.  This book could have been greatly improved if it had expanded on the career descriptions, perhaps including short interviews with actual culinary professionals, especially those in roles like institutional cooking or food research. Of course it also would have been much better if it had actually included the promised salary information, too.  It's a good book to have in a library or career center, but it's not much use for your home reference bookshelf 
  the book contains  good overall material , but the design part is totally confusing, the analog design is worst material i have ever studied. the chapters are in hapazard manner, the equations for the circuits appear from nowhere sometimes. this book is good for only a overall view. DO NOT USE THIS BOOK FOR ANY DESIGN REFERENCE . for analog design and CMOS fundamentals use Razavi , which is the best book ever 
 I have to agree with the many who did not like this book. I got it from the library and tried to read it, but couldn't get past the self-indulgent writing style. It almost seems like someone was too lazy to edit this book or make it readable for the reader. Any writer can put down stream-of-consciousness thoughts, but it takes hard work and effort to edit and revise with the reader in mind. A writer should want the reader to enjoy the process of reading a book. A book is written to express oneself, but also for the reader. Without the reader, the book is nothing.  
 This book is infuriatingly opinionated; and Fadiman spends a lot of energy and space insulting great writers and saying stupid things. He seems more intent on placing his writers into a bogus hierarchy than actually appreciating them.  Many of his judgements are simply wrong 
 After reading A Fine Balance I couldn't wait to read another book by this author. I then read his third book called Family Matters which was good but I was disappointed as it by no means compared to A Fine Balance. I just finished Such A Long Journey and found it to be okay but very slow moving and downright boring in some spots.  It is my least favorite of the three books by this author. It's hard to believe that someone can right a book like A Fine Balance, which was magnificant and one of the best books I have ever read, and then turn our stuff that is, at best, average.    
 I was very disappointed with this cheese slicer--the wire broke after about the fourth use.  I have always had good experiences with Oxo and was very surprised.  
 If so don't bother buying this, use netflix and save yourself $$ 
 I wish I could understand liberals, I really do. One reviewer here complains about how Bush can't technically be tagged a liar because of his use of generalities. Isn't saying that Bush is "WRONG ABOUT ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING" a generality? I mean, really -- he was wrong to even pardon the Turkey before Thanksgiving? For those without a sense of humor (or your average NPR listener) that was a witticism, what Americans call jokes.   Gosh you get mad when people point out you "hate" America, but isn't this book a testament to that fact? Just to save you some time, I understand that you are now thinking that I am both a nazi who believes "W" is synonymous with "America" and I'm also a McCarthyite who smears anyone who doesn't agree with my "America, right or wrong" mentality. So with that out of the way, only an insane person would believe that Bush isn't desperately concerned with protecting America and defeating REAL religious fanatics that want to do terrible things to YOU before cutting your head off. Whether you agree with his methods is a different story, but if you don't agree with his sentiment than you identify with the enemies of America and therefore can't possibly be patriotic. You are agreeing that it is more important to write a book about hating our president rather than the crazy, WMD-sucking madmen who killed over 3,000 Americans in mere seconds, and would be more than happy to continue doing so.   If you DO agree that Bush is sincere in his desire to protect America than he can't be wrong about everything, and you have somewhat of a social duty to not totally crap on the man most responsible for keeping us free and safe (until Hillary wins in 2008, of course).  If you think the war is a pretext to take over the world, and that Bush has confused national security with world conquest - well, then you have either the option of a pill to cure you, or a cult to embrace you. But even to the girls who earn hard cash a dollar at a time adjacent to a greasy pole you would be considered quite dumb. Let me ask you -- if we were after oil, then why didn't we take it in 1990 with the 1st Gulf War? Isn't that what you said at the time was our reason for going to war then (oh I know it is -- I was in DC at the time and saw the protests on the mall regularly). And if we liberated Iraq to conquer it, why did they have elections with no one named "Smith" or "Johnson" on the ballot? And finally, WHY IS OIL TO DAMN EXPENSIVE TODAY???  Jeez, I WISH we had gone to war for oil, at least I wouldn't have to buy cheaper cigars just so I can keep my SUV topped-off!  All in all, having perused these books, let me just remind you that "HATE" is not a family value, and also that Canada is a lovely, lovely place to live. 
 Although this book didn't really live up to expectations, I will at least say it provided an entertaining read.  If you're already familiar with contemporary sci-fi you won't find too many new ideas here.  A lot of the ground in this book has already been covered in works like "The Diamond Age" (Neal Stephenson - nanotech opus), "Neuromancer" (William Gibson - disembodied ID shifting), "Ender's Game" (Orson Scott Card - automated education) or "The Transmigration of Timothy Archer" (Phillip K. Dick - tricked out humans).  Of course the main difference here is that Mr. Kurzweil is not a sci-fi author but a proven inventor and entrepeneur.  He acknowledges the 'speculative non-fiction' aspects of the book but at times gets carried away with his predictions and occasionally sounds like a hokey traveling salesman.  Throughout the book he claims some degree of expertise in such broad ranging interests as nanotechnology, neurology, interactive entertainment, visual arts, biology, anthropology, philosophy, ethics and sexuality.  Granted the material draws on many of these disciplines but his arguments often come to conclusions that simply have no scientific basis.  This book, published in 1999 suggested that our brains will be "scanned" in the near future.  The concept sounds very Ghost-In-The-Shell and has about as much plausibility as a typical Japanese animation.  An article appearing in the October 2004 issue of Discover asked the question, "Will anyone ever decode the human brain"? The author, much less optimistic than Kurweil noted that "No conceivable technology will be subtle enough to discern all the memories, emotions, and meanings aroused in us by our perceptions."  He made this assumption based on the fleeting nature of the actual neurons in your brain that change and evolve rapidly every day.  To equate this mush with bits and bytes, jpegs and mp3's, is a little naive and ridiculously optimistic.  Hopefully it will happen someday, maybe even in our lifetime.  Until then though, you'd be better off reading real fiction...  This book's (almost) saving grace is Kurzweil himself.  He's obviously having fun writing this book and presumably hopes to raise some eyebrows.  Even when that comes off as legacy-building ("Remember - you read that here first!") it's oddly charming.  Inserting himself into a dialogue with his fictitious creation "Molly" is at first obnoxious, condescending even, but by the end it's actually pretty amusing.    That said, if you're holding out for some deep insight as to what a "spiritual machine" might be, I'll save you the trouble by telling you that the author's angle (in the two pages it's mentioned) is that spirituality basically boils down to biological phenomena.  Sorry, that it.  Apparently that was good enough for Mr. Data so it's also good enough Mr. Kurzweil.  Computers will one day magically start loving - once they're smart enough of course.  In the mean time, we can gloss over the fact that subjective AI is still a non entity in our world 
 I liked this book up until the ending.  I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book.  Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me 
 i love danielle steel! i`ve read ALL of her books so far.but secrets was a big disappointment to me.as far as i am concerned,ms.steel tried to change her style of writing in this book more to the kind of judith krantz or jackie collins (some explicit "parts" i didn`t like at all).simply NOT the danielle steel we like. the story itselfs is ok(gives the readers some "insights" behind the scenes of hollywood)but.... some of her books i`ve read over and over again. i am not going to touch secrets for a second time,however 
 I enjoyed The Gospel According to Larry and the thought provoking topics.  It even had suspense and mystery involved in it.  Vote for Larry was forced, and a rehashing of the same ideas in Gospel.  The plot, what there was of it, was so unbelievable and made the activism of young people seem easy--no hard-work needed.  The struggles young adults would really have experienced were not included, and it made add Constitutional Amendments look like a breeze. Also, the likelihood of an 18 year old getting so much of the Presidential vote in the November election.  I wish the author would have made it more believable and more like the Gospel--that might really incite youth activism 
 These guy's are the best I've ever seen. If you can handle the truth, then this DVD is for you. They don't say every little thing that happens is real. They check every detail 
 This CD was only average. I didn't really like 'He ain't heavy..." and "Everything is Beautiful". Just not very strong vocals. I did really like "When you tell me that you love me" But that comes on Showstoppers which is a really good CD so I would just suggest that you buy that instead. Though I do like the idea that this CD benefits the red cross.. 
 I purchased the DVD based on reviews here.  I love Bluegrass music, but this movie was terrible.  It could have been made as a high scholl project.  Consists mostly of interviews with 3 or 4 musicians, very little complete music.  A good portion of the movie is Bill Monroe walking through an old house looking at nails in the wall, doors falling off the hinges and other such nonsense.  I can't understand why it received such good reviews 
 This book is written by Hellen Keller, a blind and deaf woman, telling about her childhood and growing up. The book is filled with anecdotes. Each one is about a page or two long and has no connection with the one before it or the following one. The date can vary from year to year without much warning. I would not recommend this book to young readers. I am 14 and became quite confused at times. I had to read this book for school. There were some very nice points in the book, though. If you are a Hellen Keller fan, I would highly recommend this book. It is full of many things in her life that you would not know if you only read a biography or just watched one of the movies made of her life 
 This book had no redeeming qualities. It's important to somehow connect with the main characters, and to empathize with them to some degree. For me, a good suspense story has to have a break from the darkness once in a  while, and an exciting and absorbing plot that has me eagerly waiting to  turn the page.  This book started badly with it's main character, and only  near the end,a candle was lit.   It was too little,too late 
 There's a regressively narrow perspective signalled through the use of the outdated trope of the "dandy." The dandy is a figure so cut off from community and place that it Romantically spirals away into never-never land. By using a gender framework, the argument seems more realistically grounded than it is 
 The sound is low, static-ky, and it frequently dropped calls. Boo. 
 This book is about a writer who splits up with his long-term boyfriend, becomes depressed, and then becomes friends with a young boy (I think 10? 12? I don't remember) over the phone who was abused and used in a kiddy porn ring by his parents before escaping only to learn he had AIDs and writing a book on it. Except as the book goes on, it becomes questionable whether the kid actually exists.  All well and good, but what really makes the book stand out isn't the storyline. Noooo. It's the slashy overtones where there REALLY REALLY SQUICKILY SHOULDN'T BE ANY! I should NOT get the idea that this abused kid is this middle-aged author's fantasy. No, no, NO.  I felt dirty after reading this. I felt even more dirty after finding out via wikipedia that the author based it on a real life experience of it.  This is a scary scary man, and makes me want a long long bath. 
 You're kidding, right? This man, who hates Jews rabidly, and the state of Israel moreso, dares to cast stones at the Wahabbies? (Yes, I spell in jest.)   To my mind, his views are cut from the same cloth. Anyone who reads this book can see that clearly.   It is more Islamic hatred for the "other" albeit draped in an attack one of the most extreme elements in Islam today. Funny thing is, there are no bad words here for the Ayatollah Khomeini, evil man. That's because the author reveres his teachings, which were in no way shape or form moderate!   
 Paul Lombardo, a leading scholar on bioethics and eugenics, is working on a book on this same topic. According to his bio page, the working title is  "Better for All the World: Eugenics, the Supreme Court and Buck v. Bell." I'm guessing professor Lombardo will have to change the title of the book now that Bruinius has published one with the same name, but whatever he calls it, it will be worth the wait. Lombardo's previous work on eugenics is brilliant and Bruinius' is, well, anything but 
 I was sorely disappointed in this book. I figured I would learn how to deal with the dummy I've just been assigned to work for, but this is just an endless stream of anecdotes with no advice for folks like me 
 I don't know why anyone would buy this book when you can get the catalog for free. All it does is tell you to buy the stuff at Pottery Barn and how to use it - like we don't already know how to use a bookcase?? Don't waste your money 
 This book contains some interesting information on health problems and cures, but is 80% filler, praising the author 
 This is a rip off. This is word for word taken from the middle of another book he wrote previously.  This is the last F Paul Wilson Book I will ever purchase.  There ought to be laws against plagarizing your own self.  This $15 book is an excerpt from his previous novels. It is 93 pages of large type that would be 40 pages of normal text and it adds nothing to the story line. It is just repeating what was already written in his previous work.  This is scum - if there was a rank for zero stars, I would have used it 
 I don't think SheDaisy will last much longer.  A remix album??  SheDaisy is pulling a Paula Abdul: releasing a remix album just to sell a few more copies.  I had this album for 2 hours and returned it to the store for something else. Seriously, this is very dissappointing.  They are seriously pushing the line of country-pop.. they should re-consider their image and just focus on doing just pop 
 i ordered this book like ages ago (26th of january) for aprox 86 dollars. now the price has gone up to about 130 dollars and i kind of have the feeling that amazon doesn't want to deliver it anymore although it is in stock. the order has been already delayed twice and they said the next delivery date is going to be the 25th of march...why do i get the feeling that this date is not going to be the deliverydate also?  if i'm ordering something and it is going to be delivered 3 months later, than something is really wrong with the service.. 
 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 As a teacher, I read a lot of books about education and childhood development.  Real Boys is typical of most of these books in that the author takes 500-600 pages to say what he could have expressed in 100 pages.  Read the first chapter and you get the point of the whole book. 
 The title of this book is very intriguing and the subject of learning how to improve communication skills when things are rough is very compelling.  I was astonished and very dissapointed with the author's approach - so much so, that I was not able to make it past page 35.  I would not have made the expenditure had I known that the author created a platform for her philosophy of relationships.  Had that been my interest at the time, there are far more interesting treatises on the subject.  I rate this book as a 1 because there isn't a lower number 
 With all that happens in this book,and much of it is somewhat far-fetched, the only thing that I did not buy were the choices made in the end. They were inconsistent with the character development throughout the book. I felt cheated 
 	And lo' my children, the lord said unto thee that... wait a moment... this is the modern age why am I talking like a medieval preacher? Maybe that's because the profoundly stupefying effect that The Viccar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith had on me.  	The story starts off in a monotone text voice and goes on like that for the entire one hundred ninety nine pages, give or take a few pages depending on version. The story follows a preacher and his family as they fall from grace into poverty. A merchant steals all the money that Viccar Primrose has invested, leaving them poor and forcing them to move out from their home in Wakefield. The book continues and follows the family's trials and tribulations. 	This book was extraordinarily hard to read, I would not recommend it to anyone that is not a college level English student, and even then only at your own risk. No words are in quotes, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and the main character just preaches what the author thinks about everything. It is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read, and I am a junior English major in college.  	The characters are amazingly flat, the plot has some redeeming qualities though. The plot shows how the people of the time lived, had fun, and loved; not to mention how mothers regarded their children. The ending though was so... contrived that it ruined whatever interest the main story had.  	All in all, this story was a waste of time. If you want to learn how things worked in that age, there are plenty of stories that are easier to read, much more accurate, and have less author interruption then this book. Its negatives greatly outweigh its positives, so unless you have to read it, stay away. 
 I am a fan of Ricky but not this album. I prefer him singing spanish instead of English. The only good part about the album is the salsa sounds. 
 Started to order this item at the listed price of $299. On checkout the price was $320 - plus $22 more for handling and shipping 
 Yes, the story is pretty unbelievable, very much in the same class of the works of Fleming, Cussler, etc.  However, it is not the story or the character development that makes this a below average read.......the author really needs to change editors.  This book could be improved immeasurably by a better job of good editing.  Way too wordy, too many extra pages, scenes, action, etc, that do not add anything of value to the overall story and do much to impede the flow.  Did the author get paid by the word? Get a bonus for going over 300 pages?  Editing, editing, editing.      
 reviews are off the top of head throwaways...and you'll be disgusted to find that METALLICA and NINE INCH NAILS have no entries. go look! unbelievable 
 At Marx's graveside, Engels praised him as a revolutionary -- which he was -- and credited him with two of the greatest scientific discoveries in human history: first, that "just as Darwin discovered the law of development of organic nature, so Marx discovered the law of development of human history" and second, that Marx had discovered the "special law of motion" without which all previous economics "had been groping in the dark." Setting history on equal scientific footing with evolutionary biology, and making economics for the first time truly scientific would indeed be astounding accopmlishments.  Neither claim, however, can be supported by the evidence. No one who is not a convinced Marxist can take either claim very seriously.  How seriously, then, should one take Monique Wittig's dialectical materalist feminism, in which male/female relations become another (albeit, all-important) variant on the class struggle?  Consider for a moment the passage that the above reviewer cites with approval:  "The perenniality of the sexes and the perenniality of slaves and masters proceed from the same belief, and, as there are no slaves without masters, there are no women without men. The ideology of sexual difference functions as censorship in our culture by masking, on the grounds of nature, the social opposition between man and women. Masculine/feminine, male/female are the categories which serve to conceal the fact that social differences always belong to an economic, political, ideological order. ...The masters explain and justify the established divisions as a result of natural differences."  Mastery and slavery are reciprocal relations. A master is necessarily a "master of ..." and a slave the "slave of ..." Reduce the situation to its simplest form: one master and one slave. If the master dies, the slave, having no master, is no slave; if the slave dies, the master, having no slave, is no master. Is it even remotely plausible to say that a man is always the "man of ..." or a woman a "woman of ..."? Let there be two, a man and a woman (the garden we can dispense with). If the man dies, is there no longer a woman, or vice versa?  One might wish to consider that "the perenniality of sexes" has at least *something* to do with sexual dimorphism in animals, something which, since it predates the human species, presumably also predates the human social "beliefs" which are said by Wittig to give rise to it.  Wittig makes some fair points about the use and abuse of sex differentiation as ideology, but her reasoning is constantly undercut by her fallacious inference from the ideological *use* of something X for political purposes to something X's *being* no more than an ideological construction. Are ideological appeals to nature sometimes used to mask social oppositions, as Wittig says? Yes. Does it follow that all appeals to nature are therefore either false or ideological? No. Are the categories male/female sometimes used to conceal differences which are in reality social, economic, and political? Yes. Does it follow that the categories male/female are merely ideological artifacts which exist only for the purpose of such concealment? No. Do oppressors always appeal to the natural order of things to justify their oppressions? Yes. Does it follow that all appeals to nature are attempted justifications of oppression on the part of would-be oppressors? No. &c.  Strictly speaking, Wittig's thought is impossible on its own terms, for "the primacy of difference so constitutes our thought that it prevents turning inward on itself to question itself, no matter how necessary that may be to apprehend the basis of that which precisely constitutes it." But, this, of course, is what Wittig proposes to do. We cannot be surprised -- for we recall that Marx's thought -- which exposed all previous (and indeed all non-Marxist thought) as mere ideology driven by material factors -- was itself exempt from that harsh fate, was instead, science. So too Wittig will provide us with an account that cannot be given by anyone lacking her dialectical materialism (i.e. her), and cannot be refuted by anyone at all -- since arguing against is, after all, with Freud, to further validate the theory.  Like Marx, Wittig is a bringer of enlightenment: "Women do not know that they are totally dominated by men, and when they acknowledge the fact, they can 'hardly believe it.' " One wonders what sort of "fact" is meant here, within the historicist, social-constructivist framework in which Wittig situates her discourse. One also wonders about this lack of knowledge on the part of women. Totally dominated! And unawares! Perhaps one wonders less at their incredulity upon being informed.  But matters are even worse: "And often ... they refuse to 'believe' that men dominate them with full knowledge." But the truth must out. (I am guessing that Wittig writes "believe" because, once she has delievered her revelation, on one can actually refuse to believe it -- at most, they can refuse to "believe" it). Men may also refuse to "believe" it, but unlike the benighted women, they have the knowledge that women (Wittig excepted) lack. Even Marx was never so bold as to credit the capitalists with anything beyond a clear view of their own short-sighted economic interest. But men are here an nigh omniscient class of oppressors -- although there seems to be a bit of a chicken and egg problem with this, if "men" and "women" are created only by men oppressing women, but there were neither men to oppress nor women to be oppressed before the oppression -- how did this all get started? But no matter! Has not Jean Paulhan said that women are slaves and love their slavery, in his preface to The Story of O? Ipse dixit; ergo hoc verum est.  "It cannot be said," Wittig says, "that one of these two productions (reproduction) is 'natural', while the other one is social." Again, Marx at least never attempted to formulate a theory of the class struggle for the means of production among the non-human species. Why? Because production, labor, work is what (for Marx) makes the human species distinctively human. A good argument for there being at least something natural about reproduction (it seems to me) is that it takes place both in non-human animals and it took place (as I presume Wittig would admit) in the pre-historic, pre-political evolutionary history of the human species. *That* reproduction may be commodified is not in question, but is it truly the case that to suggest that it is, in some sense, natural, to give "only the theoretical, ideological justification for oppression"?  Wittig writes in a powerful polemical style, but her argumentation, such as it is, proceeds in turn by assertion, appeal to quotations by (dubious) authorities, appeal to dubious theory (e.g. dialectical materialism) as if its truth were established, false analogies, and unwarranted inferences that (interestingly) always seem to arrive at pre-given truths as their conclusions. This is, in short, a book for the already convinced, or at best, a book for those willing to be convinced by rhetoric, revolutionary fervor, and righteous indignation rather than reasoning.  I cannot recommend it as a work of serious, thoughtful feminism 
 Unless you enjoy movies that are not funny, not scary, and have the worst actors this side of rodeo clowns, DO NOT WATCH this series of horrible flicks.  Putrid!  Not even "so-bad-it's-funny". Absolutely the worst films in the history of mankind!  Heed my warning!  SUCKS!! 
 I love Abbott & Costello movies but I was really dissapointed when I saw this set because it was missing the rest of the movies they did. I mean I can understand a lot of their films were with universal but i really thought they were looking to do the volumes to cover all of their movies.   Honestly I was happy to see the keystone cops, jeckle & hyde and meet the mummy ones on the dvd but that seemed to be it for their feature films on it. The others were documentries. I fear this may be the last of the volumes which leaves out a lot of their other films. Also it does not say on the volumes "The Universal Pictures Of Abbott & Costello" It clearly states "The Franchise Collection" This means we should be seeing our 8 movies on there.   Now if it was up to me what to put out this is how vol.4 would be:    It' Ain't Hay        Lost In Harem        In Hollywood        The Noose Hangs High        Meet The Keystone Cops        Meet The Mummy        Meet Dr. Jeckle & Mr. Hyde        Meet Captain Kidd Now after that I would put out a Volume 5 that would have these on it:First their lost film : Rio Rita                               Africa Screams                                Meet Jack & The Beanstalk                               Meet Jerry Seinfeld                               World of A&B                               Meet The Monsters (Documentry)                               Dance With Me Henry And for the 8th,(Now i know this breaks the rules a bit but i think this would be a great way to rap up the complete collection of the films) The forty foot Bride of Candy Rock (Lou's Solo Picture without Bud) Because it was his last before he died.  And There you have it the collection they ought to have put out. Now I know their not gonna do it this way, but if it helps others to know what films are missing from their collections then this is a great list 
 This product simply DOES NOT WORK.  I purchased this item about a month ago to back up my software on my old PC (because I was about to buy a new PC).  After backing up all my photos, music, files extra using the trusted drag-n-drop method it seemed as though the files loaded successfully on the hard drive.  I restarted my old computer and verified that the files were on the drive.  Everything seemed ok.  I then went to my new computer to upload the files but it said that the files didn't exist.  It was panic time (because I had already reformatted my old compuer) so I just lost all my files.  I went to WD Support and I was told to only back my files up using their software called Retrospect.  If I used drag and drop, then who knows what will happen.  I was enraged.  External hard drives are supposed to be simple, like portable USB drives, but WD has made a simple process more difficult that it needs to be.  I will NEVER recommend or buy a Western Digital product again 
 The title grabbed me because I have been noticing for, oh about 14 years now, the decline of the truth in this country.  Unfortunately, this book is written precisely by the kind of person who has lost touch with reality and what truth is (definition of irony I believe).  The reason it is #1 on the bestseller list is because there is a ready audience out there, of similarly detached people, who want anything (and I mean anything - a website with a good conspiracy story and a glass of warm milk before bed everynight is their ideal) that backs up their point of view.    It is precisely why the truth is so out of fashion.  New media streams like the internet, blogs, etc. offer up "news" without accountability.  They allow this segment of society to avoid confronting the truth and instead construct their own alternative realities.  It makes people like Frank Rich, rich, with very little effort.  Why bother checking facts, his core readership doesn't care whether it is true or not, just tell them Bush is evil 
 They should have given Bellow his Nobel Prize a couple of years earlier, to avoid the aspersion this novel throws upon it. While this novel displays as well as any Bellow's stylistic fluency, the story really has no serious moral or intellectual interest, and thus the ornaments of style are wasted. The protagonist is capricious to the point of carelessness and free of the burden of any serious commitments, ethical or otherwise. He is so narcissistic that the reader is forced to doubt either his intelligence or his humanity. It would be comforting if the novel meant to expose a pathological frame of mind - albeit not of the most malignant kind - but the character's picaresque adventures, inconsequential struggles, ephemeral desires, and his shallow reflections upon them, are given far too much space for such a purpose to obtain. It is a matter of genuine puzzlement to me why Bellow chose to give such a generous platform to this impoverished character, whose moral substance is nothing beside, for instance, the much more weighty Mr. Sammler, through whom Bellow successfully accomplishes the only purpose this novel could have been meant for (and fails in), which is to examine the pressures which modern American society forces upon the articulate mind, evaluate the resulting changes in relations with others and oneself, and to convey the pathos of our failures to repair what is damaged thereby.   In a word, don't waste your time 
 Irvine Welsh has been a lot of things to a lot of different people- some say he's the best thing to happen to British writing in a decade, some say he's just a flash-in-the-pan with uncouth sensibilities who writes thoughtless, violent stories about amoral scumbags. Say what you will about Welsh as a writer- be it that he's talented, sick, brilliant, strange or just plain nuts- but he is, and has never been, boring. Until now. "Marabou Stork Nightmares" is a colossal letdown after the one-two punch of "Trainspotting" and "The Acid House", a jumbled, convoluted tale about a repugnant [man] trawling his last moments away in a life that most closely resembles a bedridden hell. This is not the first first-person account of a psychopath that Welsh has written- see later, his aptly-titled "Filth"- but even at his worst, D.S. Bruce Robertson had a sort of perverse wit to him, while this story lacks anything short of coherence, wit, humor or even plot.  The protagonist of this brutish tale is Roy Strang, a bedridden criminal pissing the last moments of his sad life away in a bed, ready to die. As he slowly slips in and out of consciousness, Roy reflects on the family upbringing- that entailed rape, sexual molestation and the vicious abuse of his right-wing Uncle- that led him to this state. We see later in his life, as Roy attempts to straighten himself out, get a job and "choose life", as it were, but we continue to see that he cannot escape the sins of his past. All the while, he hunts the formidable African Predator the Marabou Stork- a personification of all the misery, evil, hatred, pain and badness in Roy himself- on a wild Safari in Africa, that ostensibly all takes place in Roy's morphine-and-depravity-addled brain.  The novel proves that Welsh can still pull plenty of tricks out of his proverbial hat when it comes to language- some of his bawdy, boy's-night-out Scottish dialogue still provokes a chuckle or two, while the disgusting gangrape scene towards the book's denouement is one of the more haunting I have read in recent memory. And yet, for all its mild pleasures, this book still sees Welsh falling majorly short of the mark, sinking into the endless mire of Roy Strang's egomaniacal fever dream. Consider this one a real "Nightmare" 
 Having avoided seeing this film, I found that the mistake of sending my partner to the rental store on his on, brought "Tuesday..."unbiden into our home.My aversion to Oprah and her ilk, does not cloud my dislike of this film. A bad film is a bad film.Devoid of any real plot and hampered by some very poor acting on the part of all concerned, and directionless directing, this film should not be seen by anyone who values the aforementioned,To me a reasonable premise should move a story forward. Something should occur, my interest should be engaged. This film takes reams of pre-packaged aphorisms and greeting card verses, and attempts to build the plot from words alone. It is as if someone picked up the telephone book and said, "Hey,this book is full of words, lets make a movie."In a way a movie about the different lives of those listed in the telephone book would be more interesting.To be honest, Jack Lemmon was not very good in this film. He played the same character he always did. Just older. Hank Azaria was just awful. He talked as if his mouth was filled with stones, and was wooden and expressionless. Maybe he was too embarrased to be there. As to the other actor's; well they filled up the space nicely.The look of the film was cheap and of the movie of the week quality. The sprayed on snow in a winter scene looked as fake as it was. They even covered the green leaves on the trees. Some better acting, some good R rated dialogue, and maybe some nudity would have spiced up this film. As it stands,however, it will only be of interest to fans of Oprah and Dr.Phil, etc. The purveyors of our national state of pity and feeling soory for ourselves.It is seldom that we find car keys under our chairs, but films such as this perpetuate the myth that a few nice phrases, a good cry, and a genial talk-show presenter will somehow make it all better.I,for one, think that a nice cuppa is more beneficial. Then pull the finger out, and just get on with it.(To the grammar and form police: I did have this in paragraphs, but the editing process scrunched it all together. Sorry 
 I will usually read and accept anything, but this book is just so beyond fact for even realistic fiction.  I could have handled this book a lot better if there was no "Frankie".  The character Frankie is just too unbelievable.  I work with "talented and gifted" children that are Frankie's age (8 years old) and not one of them is even remotely this advvanced.  If Frankie was say, 12 or 13 I could accept her maturity, her dedication to her music and so forth, but this is not even believable to anyone who has a child or works with them.  It would be tolerable if Frankie was not the center of the book.  They spend more time about Frankie this and Frakie that, then on the main plot of the book.  This is the 3rd book that I have read or at least tried to read from Iris Johansen and it will be my last.  I just don't like the way she writes or her main characters.  Evertime I buy another one of her books I am always hoping that this will be the one that changes my mind.  Oh well, another book to donate 
                        I don't understand why many people entitle this album: "the best of Eric Clapton".For me,Slowhand is simply a "flat" album.....If you want the best Clapton's albuns, buy the following:Eric Clapton                           Live -The Rainbow Concert                           There's one in every Crowd                           Money and Cigarettes                           Behind the Sun                           Journeyman                           live-24 nights                           Pilgrim                           Rush                           One more car, one more rider.                           layla 
 I read this as a school asignment and I did not enjoy it.  I did not really understand the meaning of the book.  I guess it aplied to the world a while ago but I can't aply it to life today.  It was rather confusing for  me 
 I have the 1995 British edition of this book - same cover, same authors, presumably the same text inside, but with the title "Postmodernism for Beginners". I think that title falls foul of the U.K's Trade Description Act, but so, I think, does the present one. I know a little about Postmodernism from a much better short book (Christopher Butler's "Postmodernism: A Very Short Introduction", Oxford 2002), and I found particularly the first half of the Appignanesi book absolutely impenetrable. That first half, unlike Butler's, includes Structuralism in Postmodernism; but on Structuralism you would do much better to read John Sturrock's short "Structuralism" (Paladin), which is much more lucid and accessible, even if it doesn't have pictures in it! The second half of the Appignanesi book does at least have some suggestive ideas about the contemporary world.  
 This was by far one of the worst books I've ever read. Who in the world dreams of becoming a hooker? And who in the world is a hooker while they are engaged to an amazing man, and continues being a call girl even after she gets married? This is one of those books, that as an author, has you fuming that it ever got published in the first place. Tracy Quan must be sleeping her way through agents and publishers, because this was the most stupidest story ever written 
 It's World War I. There's death and dispair and darkness everywhere and yet amidst all the anguish, there comes the tale of two lovers and their sad struggle to live a complete life. It's the daring anti-war classic from the late great Ernest Hemmingway- A Farewell to Arms!  Sounds pretty promising, huh? Let's see how it REALLY is.  First things first, the Lovers- Fred Henry is an American in the Italian army. He begins the story feeling rather mildly about the war and life in general until he accidentally falls in love and things begin to change. He is a totally self-absorbed, unsympathetic dick. He narrates the story and yet somehow we get little insight into any of his deeper emotions or motives. I literally hated him by the end. Catherine Barkley is a beautiful English nurse who Henry falls for. She's still healing from her last lovers death when she meets him. At first she seems like she might turn out to be at least somewhat intresting, but the hope vanishes everytime she opens her mouth. She is  shallow, moronic, ridiculous, and one of the most unrealistic and dislikable females characters I've ever read. Henry, however, falls desperately in love with her and her thick head of blond hair.  Next we have the plot- As you know, it's WWI. Things aren't going so well. Henry mets Catherine. Henry gets injured and falls in love with Catherine. They spend almost all their time remarking how "sweet" and "fine" the other is and reassuring eachother they're really in love. Then they have some sex and Catherine gets pregnant. Henry cares somewhat. He's then forced to go back to war, however, but not before Catherine tells him she feels like a whore when he takes her to a hotel. This is the only intresting thing she ever says but she quickly retracts the statement as to not upset dear, darling Henry. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Henry deserts the army. This is one of the few exciting parts. Unfortunately, though, Henry soon goes back to Catherine. This is where is book takes a turn for the worst. The lovers breifly share happiness until Catherine has her baby, the baby dies and at last Catherine dies. Tragic.   My Opinion- The book is dull. When Catherine died I was just glad the book was over. The prose in this novel is some of the most boring and terse I've ever read. The dialouge is some of the most irriating. Between Henry's emotionless "Yes", "No"s, and "All right"s and Catherine's pointless, opinionless chatter, I'm not sure how anyone could be grabbed or moved in the slightest. Neither character had much going for them and I couldn't care less about their miserable fates. Hemmingway could have turned this into something so much better if only he gave his readers some likeable people who we could love and relate to. I don't know about the rest of you, but I thought his was the biggest waste of an idea ever. Cheers 
 Ive never done a review before because I have never been so disgusted with a product.  Ive had mine a few weeks. Used it twice a week.. which equals roughly 10 uses so far. Well, just now the little knob that gets screwed in to hoold the arm in place to prevent it from swinging BROKE.. cracked right in half as I was turning it with my fingers. I didnt even put any weight into it!!  Last week the nut that holds the eye hook and entire weight of the heavy bag fell off sending my bag crashing to the ground. I dont know why they wouldnt put something more permanent up there instead of a 2 cent nut.  The design is terrible. Rather than have the supports and screw holes run the length of the wall studs they have then run so you  mount two in the studs two in the drywall.. unless of course you do the wood mount like another user suggested ( which is what I did ).  TKO just lost me. I will NEVER buy ANYTHING from them again. Seventy dollars for this CHinese made garbage. Im sure the welds will be the next thing to go.   Buyer bewar 
 (Hey, this review is supposed to be 5 stars! What's up with the editing?)   O. K.   Get ready.   Take a ...deeeeeeep ....breath.....   This book, written in 1991, is about to become relevant again!  Yergin's "hydrocarbon man" is alive and well and living in the 21st century.  No book has ever captured the excitement, risk, and reward of the oil business like this volume does. Daniel Yergin documents oil patch history, from the simple beginnings as a native american medicine to todays complex international traffiking.  Truely, hydrocarbon extraction from the subsurface is the stuff of modern life.  Try to live without the carbon-hydrogen bond and you'll find out what life is like with an odd-even social-security-number lottery for the gas chamber. (Maybe I exaggerate a bit, but trust me... you don't want to look down this road.)  My advice:  Buy this book!   Buy it today!   Read it as soon as you receive it!   The next day may be too late!    (As I write this, gasoline prices rose today by about 8 cents because of the Alaskan pipeline.)     Also, thank your local geologist. And buy him a beer 
 I purchased this book as something to read before book 7 but found it to contain even less information than most websites let alone have anything new in it at all. The author has a small bias towards characters which may also not suit all readers. If you really must have everything HP then get it but this book will not give you anything new that you could not read at any of the four big websites 
 In his book, Hatab describes democracy as a continual contest, without having to depend on notions as a universal "human nature", a "common good" and "human equality". He explains how Nietzsche assailed democracy as a secular, political extension of traditional religious frameworks; frameworks that are now suspect and have lost their central role in culture. Indeed, belief in God is no longer considered necessary and purely secular and scientific models are promoted to understand the world and human culture. But our confidence in secular "truths" should be suspect because they arose in connection with the concept of that same God! The Christian image of a single, transcendent, omnipotent and benevolent God introduced the idea that all humans are free. For Hegel, the French Revolution - with its 'liberty, equality, fraternity' triad - was  the ploitical realization of an ideal that first took form in religious imagination. Political developments in this way, explains Hatab, are the concrete expression of religious ideals. The Enlightenment was not a break with religion. For Hegel, its secular movement was the realization of a vision that in the past had been located in a transcendent realm and postponed for an afterlife. Because democratic political principles are descendants of transcendent constructs that can no longer be sustained, Nietzsche saw no reason to believe in democracy and insisted on revising, in naturalistic terms the script of democracy's development. Democracy, like morality is dismantled in his analysis of master-slave and creator-herd exchanges, in his opposition to any system grounded in reason or universal human subject, and in his adoption of a decent red field of power plays among competing life forces. Political arrangements are power relations, originally manifested in the dominance of the master, followed by the counter-conquest of slave values.  The master expresses active will to power. Courage, conquest, command,  produce feelings of power and are deemed "good". Cowardice, humility and dependence are deemed "bad". According to slave morality conquest is evil, harmlessness and security are good. Slave types find enhancement not through their own agency but through debilitation of others; by supplanting "power" with "justice" and "love". Nietzsche sees in this ideal a disguised form of power. The slave expresses reactive will to power. The promotion of political equality, is the weak majority grabbing power to incapacitate the strong few. In democracy, slave values have now been redirected from the internal realms of religious imagination and moral ideals to the external public realm of political power. In democratic politics, the herd instinct actually rules and the consequence is the hegemony and promulgation of mediocracy and a vapid conformism. Philosophical justifications for political freedom have flowed from a modernist picture of a common - definable - "human nature":  a unified order of needs, attributes and faculties, that can be discovered by rational examination. The subject is a "substance", the site of identity and the causal source of action and rights. Nietzsche rejects this model of an individual, unified, substantive, rationally ordered human nature. The self is not an enduring substance, not a unified subject, not an organized unity, but an arena, for a irresolvable contest of deferring drives. There is no single subject, but a multiplicity of subjects, whose interplay and struggle is the basis of our thought and our consciousness. Only the strong few can be given the freedom of self-direction. Most people, because of their weakness, would disintegrate. For Nietzsche, modern conceptions of justice and injustice are secular reverberations of ancient aversions of the inequities of the natural order, with  the difference being that modern diagnosis and rectifications have turned away rom a divine script toward human and political projects. From a Nietzschean standpoint, if our politics is to be truly "worldly" we must accept and affirm the natural inequities of fortune. Hatab, however, believes that it is possible to connect democracy with a version of will to power without making his mistake in believing that moral prescriptions against violence arose only by way of slave mentality, or that feeding the hungry, aiming at honesty in human relations, or treating people with kindness are signs of weakness. Such values can be life-affirming. But Hatab agrees that they are complex and always in danger of inciting life-denying attitudes and practices. All in all, he says, Nietzsche was wrong in rejecting democracy and it can be more amenable to his way of thinking than he imagined. Hatab searches another route to democracy by sidestepping most of the machinery of political theory - especially its preoccupation with "human nature" because the fact that democracy does require that all citizens be given the same rights, can be red scribed in non-essentialist terms, does not depend upon any version of "sameness" in human beings.  Democracy, he argues, can be sustained without the traditional banner of human equality. He explains how other meanings of the word "equal"  come through in nonsubstantive egalitarian discourse, such as equal respect and equal importance; how equal regard transfers egalitarianism from the substantive nature of persons to an ATTITUDE towards persons: from "human nature" to demands about how humans ought to view and threat each other. Along this way, he reaches the conclusion that democratic practice can be understood agonistically: political judgments are not dictated, outcomes depend upon contest of speeches (the results are binding). Democratic elections allow for and depend upon peaceful exchanges and transitions of power (language is the weapon in democratic contests). Truth and expertise are much more problematic in politics than in certain professions and disciplines, and the coercive effects of political rule extend to all citizens; so an open, inclusive contest for temporary rule is more appropriate in politics. The political contest of speeches must be repeated periodically; elections are decision procedures in matters that are globally undecidable; democracy is not rule by the people, but it is a rule which is decided by a contest among different perspectives. Democratic respect depends upon recognizing the finitude and contingency of one's own beliefs and interests. Authoritarianism is the only option when truth and error are presumed to be decisively delineated; it is confidence in truth that lends itself so easily to hierarchy and exclusion of the other! The finitude of the human condition and the agonistic pluralism of the social milieu leads him to a political preference for democracy as a procedural arrangement that is not reducible to any bounded concept of human nature.  Democracy is described as a continual political experiment, an open-ended procedure for generating and testing outcomes. He agrees that democratic procedures imply and require familiar freedoms, rights and elements of justice -  within a fluid field of social forces (not human nature),  i.e. a social milieu, conflict and finitude being given,  prompts Hatab to a thinking that does not depend upon fixed constructions of human nature. In his analysis, the participatory element rejects aristocraticism and the procedural element insists upon an agonistic dynamic. An agonistic perspective simply stipulates that one's commitment cannot be backed up by some decisive "truth". He argues that we have to distinguish a non-foundation list ethics from a crude relativism, which tends to mean that different moral beliefs simply holds true for those who holds them. We must see the ethical field as agonistic and decide how to live - without allowing global undecibility to demoralize us, or debilitate our capacity to make local commitments. Even if there is no ultimate answer to moral questions, we cannot avoid situations in which we have to come up with answers by choosing some options and excluding others. An agonistic pluralism is 'negative' in its depiction of human nature - arguing against universality, sameness, harmony and stressing differences and conflict.   Some outstanding conclusions of his analysis are that atomic individualism is unsustainable because of the sociality of human experience (but at the same time,  social relations are agonistic); that a democratic society can and should have a certain ethical concern that basic human needs be met ( participatory requirements include "positive" rights that demand some provision by the state such as the right to education, to certain level of economic sustenance); that any perspective has the opportunity to win political support and temporary power ( but it cannot claim to have "democracy" on its side, or "the people" or the "common good" or "justice"); that the notion of separation of church and state is a great gift to politics (since religious commitments have been a significant source of oppression when joined with political power); the communitarian idea is an important counterweight to liberal individualism ( the actual danger of collective envelopment of the individual, however, rekindles libertarian narratives..... along with multicultural narratives that seek to protect particular cultural orientations from being cancelled out in favor of a universal conception of community); capitalism is in part wedded to individual freedom, but socialist criticism are built on the recognition of systemic inequities); that competitive fairness demands certain public services that can give other citizens a fighting chance because it is wrong to let people who cannot compete go to grief (but proposals for complete outcomes run afoul of agonistic conditions);  that freedom is enhanced by submission to political constraints (politics is the continual interaction of competing forces, ambiguous meanings and unstable signifiers: individual liberty, order, authority, equality...); rights are social phenomena guaranteed by the power of the state (they can be defined by way of the absence of decisive truth in politics and the absence of essences in human nature - the notion of an unstable self subverts the grounding of rights in any identifiable "human nature"); that we must permit hateful or false speech, because a banned belief might turn out to be true ( free speech demands that we risk our beliefs by inviting opposition). Concerning that last point, it might be argued that we must not respect viewpoints that deliberately speak against pluralistic openness and democratic values. But Hatab believes that we might have faith that an airing of such a viewpoint and vigorous opposition to it in the public arena would weaken it ( censoring a troublesome belief may strengthen it - commitments against racism might atrophy in the wake of a silenced opposition). There is some truth he says in every viewpoint (even a racist one) and we can learn about the fears of otherness that give rise to racist agendas, with the hope that we might learn how to forestall or diminish them. In his opinion an agonistic democracy should conceive itself as an oscillation between capitalistic and socialistic narratives, but intrusive projects of redistribution are unjust and oppressive - guaranteeing competitive opportunity suffices. Many problems indigenous to capitalism can be ameliorated by democratic principles to the economic relationships of workers and employers 
  I purchased this book without reading the reviews and I regret that now! The book essentially tells the story of two interfaith families, and how they coped with the spiritual education of their children. One family opted to raise their children as Jews, the second choose to raise the children as both ,   which led to little or no religious based education. This was quite disheartening for me, as our plan is to both baptize our children, and have a traditional bris or naming ceremony. I wanted to learn how to teach my kids about God, Jesus, and the bible staying as true as possible to both Catholicism and Judaism . Understanding this is going to be quite a challenge I was putting a lot of hope into this volume. Unfortunately, this book offered no practical solutions, except to favor raising your kids as Jews. At no point did this text offer any solution on what to do if both parents are very strong in their faith and want to pass that on. I am disappointed that a book that asks a simple question never really answers it. At one point in   the book, the daughter of the 'both' family indicates she is sorry she isn't anything. She 'resents she was raised without a real religion'.   That is so sad, and this book never explains what to do to prevent the result.  Try a different source. This one will only frustrate you. 
 (2.5 stars) First time director Steve Pink has written the screenplay for two wonderful films, High Fidelity and Grosse Point Blank, so as a director, I would imagine that he would have to read the script before deciding to make a film.  Either he had a case of blindness the day he read the script, or he didn't read it at all.  Also, he didn't take the time to research writers Adam Cooper and Bill Collage, who, while still relatively new to the game, hav been responsible for one of the worst films of the decade (2004's Olsen disaster, New York Minute).  Being said, Accepted isn't the worst film of the decade, nor is it even remotely in the worst films of the year category.  Rather, Accepted is a seriously ambitious film, with a plot "as thin as Nicole Richie on a fad diet", to quote Richard Roeper.  That statement couldn't be more on the money.  To retread other reviewers, at the beginning of the film, Sherman Schrader (played by Jonah Hill, whose thirty second role in The 40-Year Old Virgin was hysterical) says to main character Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long, of such bad films as Herbie Fully Loaded and Waiting...) "This will never work."  And it won't.  There are holes in every part of the film's design.  None of this will ever work.  It's impossible.  So, then, I pose the question: Why make a film out of a plot that would in no way shape or form ever work?  And please don't answer my question with some stock answer like: "Well, it's escapism.  It doesn't need to work."  Which may be true, in some cases, if the screenplay is written properly.  Accepted's is not.  Every character (with one exception; more on him later) is a complete stock character, drawn from every teen/college movie ever made.  Bartleby is the slacker type, who, done right (see Ferris Bueller), can actually be funny.  There is Schrader, the fat kid that gets picked on, and in this film, made to dress like a sperm, a hot dog, and scores of other things.  There is the Tomboy, or Rory in this case (played by Maria Thayer, of the wonderful "Strangers With Candy"), who nobody seems to see as a beautiful woman (and she is very beautiful), but as one of the guys.  Also enter the Token Black Guy (to use terminology from Not Another Teen Movie), Hands (played by Columbus Short).  Of course, no "main gang" character list would be complete without the wierd kid that nobody understands, or in Accepted, Glen (Adam Herschman).  The film is also riddled with gross out humor, and to keep quoting Richard Roeper (from his review of Waiting...), "You can do gross out stuff and still be funny, but it has to have some decent dialogue and characters."  So, you ask, why am I generously giving this film 2.5 stars if it seems like I hate it so much?  Well, Accepted does have some irresistable laughs, and it sort of grew on me, but only because of the things it has to say about the education system.  In college, you are required to take high cost classes that you don't really want to take, but are forced to anyway.  Why not let kids take a numerous amount of classes to figure out what they want to do, and still have it count for their degree?  But, the way Bartleby and his gang go about it is too loose for college freshmen.  If freshmen had as much freedom as this college allows, they would be passed out every night and never actually learn anything.  There are more kind of commonsensical things that the film says about our seriously damaged educational system, but I'll let you discover it on your own.  The only thing that kept me in the theater long enough to hear some of the insights was the what had to be improvisation of the brilliant Lewis Black.  There is absolutely no way that these screenwriters could have written such brilliant rants and raves.  It had to have been improvised, and besides, if you have listened or seen any of Black's stand-up shows, his dialogue sounds much like his philosophies.  Black plays Ben Lewis (aptly named Dean Lewis), Schrader's ill-begotten uncle, who used to be a college dean, and now works in a shoe store.  It isn't long and Lewis is fired and helps in Bartleby & Gang's plot to start a college.  With all of this information, I leave the decision to you.  Weigh heavily the points I have outlined and determine if you want to spend nine or ten dollars to see this in the theater, or if it might be better to wait for it to come out on DVD.  I can't really lean either way; this is definitely a personal taste film 
 Does Jay-Z's 'music' have any merit? This question was thankfully answered for us all by the Communist Chinese government recently, when they denied him permission to perform a concert in Shanghai. The reason for this was because his music contains too many "profane references" and "vulgar language." No surpise there.   Countries like America can still afford to encourage Black ghettoization and allow dumb middle class White kids to 'act out' their street hoodlum fantazies, but a country like China where over a BILLION people have to peacefully coexist and avoid irritating each other can't. Rap 'music' with its celebration of drug dealers, pimps, violence and guns is therefore revealed to be what it really is - antisocial posion, more at home in some jungle - urban or otherwise - than in an orderly society where people respect each other. Well done China! 
 I purchased this book as a requirement for a new job.  I recently left the practice of law and went to work for a company that designs, sells and installs home theaters.  Having graduated from law school, one would think I could understand just about everything.  Wrong.  This book touts itself as one that is for the masses - the everyday schmo who is looking to do this themselves.  While extraordinarily well written, it is NOT for everyone.  It is overly complex and technical for the everyday guy and is more apropos for electrical engineers or experts in the field.  finally, the issue I received was supposed to be a recent edition and, if it was, it's already painfully out of date and needs revamped 
 I've seen all four Scary Movie and I have to tell that the second one is the funniest. Yes, they are all stupid, but funny stupid. It's only funny because they are making fun of other pretty good movies. There is some offensive language and content, some might get a little offended.  
 I remember seeing CHILDREN OF THE CORN right after reading Stephen King's short story version in his classic book, Night Shift. I was excited because King's story was such good scary fun. Well, I watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was. While the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror, the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze. King's story was short (like 10-20 pages) and sweet, w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields. The movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter. The running time is 90 minutes, including about an hour's worth of padding. COTC would have made an excellent addition to one of King's anthology movies like CREEPSHOW. As it stands, it's bloated and pretty boring. Of course, Linda Hamilton is in it, which is why I gave it an extra star...        
 I have my own personal barometer to indicate whether or not a book is second-rate (or worse).  I start counting the typos, and when I hit "five," I officially distrust the author/editors.  I hit five by the third chapter and knew I was in for a bumpy ride.  This author should have concentrated on spell-checking and fact-checking, rather than obsessing with his thinly veiled,homophobic assertions (as mentioned by another reader, his repeated reference to "Leo McCrary" nearly made me hurl the book across the room!).  This really was a maddening read, and it is hardly the biography that the great Gene Kelly deserves.  Makes one even sadder to ponder that Kelly's own autobiography was lost when his house burned down in the 80's.  That would have been a helluva read.   
 This is nothing more that a very overpriced screenplay, nothing more, I, like so many of the other reviewers, was disappointed and more than a little perplexed at the staggering price, for such a lackluster cheap book.  As for the movie, well I, like so many people was impressed with Lost in Translation, of course I love Bill Murray, but I was extremly disappointed in this film, who ever did the casting for this film..with the exception of Rip Torn as Louis XV, should turn their work visa's in, I mean Jason Swartzman as Louis XVI, are you serious, Swartzman is hideous and such a strange little man, and I did not buy Kristen Dunst for one minute as the Hapsburg Princess, neither of them looked the part at all, I did appreciate the authentic Versailles interiors, and the movie was shot beautifully, but the story was totally inaccurate, I cringe at the thought that people who know nothing about Louis and Antionette will think this film is an authetic story..this is a fairy tale, and Coppola took such liberties with the story, that is nothing but her ficticious take on history and it ended abruptly, Im not sure the point of the film, it did not show the beginning of her life or the end, the Europeans at Cannes hated this film as did ninety percent of the reviews...in this case the masses where correct, Marie Antoinette is a very mediocre movie and this is a rip off of a book..I think those annointing Coppola the next Scorcesse, need to watch The Departed, now THAT'S a great movie.  Oh and dont get me started on the soundtrack...good lord, what the hell was she thinking?..whatever..awful book..awful movie  
 I expected more for the price. There are some nice ideas and a few plans, but the plans don't contain measurements. This is not very professional and makes implementation very difficult. Nice for dreaming, but no real help planning 
 All of the curse words are bleeped out. I just can't get past it. Why put in curse words if you're gonna bleep them? Its really irritating 
 So, yeah, it mounts in your bathroom with the suction cups, and once it's mounted, it stays put pretty well.  Unfortunately, it has so far never actually been "fogless."  Get a good shower going, and the mirror fogs up in record time.  Splash some water on it, and you can see yourself for half a minute, but overall, this is a disappointment.  
 J.A. Jance's novel, Outlaw Mountain, is one of the worst books i have read in years.  Her characters and their dialogue, both inward and spoken, are completely unbelievable.  The storyline is convoluted and riddled with useless drama which is completely unnecessary for the plot.  The fact that I was able to finish this book was an act of pure discipline.  I am a worse person just for having consumed this book.  I would advise anyone who is considering purchasing or reading this book to save their time and money 
 I was left wanting a little more after getting this book.  You would think a Vogue book would have up to date styles.  I found a lot of the patterns dated and even kind of ugly.  I wouldn't spend my valuable time knitting something that I wouldn't want to wear myself 
 The book is about leading a company, not about the law of attraction. Although it may be a fine book for entrepreneurs, it is not a book on philosophy 
 This Nick Tosches book focuses primarily upon, (1) Nick Tosches, and (2) organized crime, rather than upon Sonny Liston. Tosches' writing is overwrought and self-indulgent; the history he provides is thin and unrevealing; and the portrait he draws of Liston - a truly fascinating, troubled, and battered figure - is cartoonish. Tosches skips over the two Liston-Clay (Ali) fights in a couple pages, despite their importance to the Liston career and the national mood at the time.  He instead embraces Chuck Wepner, who may be a nice guy but lacks any significance in the fight-game.  In sum, the Tosches misses the story almost entirely, and his narcissistic writing style ends up wasting the reader's time 
 I was a little suspicious when I read all the amazing reviews.  I should have followed my hunch.  This book is mostly new age talk with no real advice (ie, "feel the blue and red flame of your inner love").  What am I supposed to do with that kind of advice?  If you're into that, good for you.  I'm gonna go look for some more practical advice 
 Very, very disappointing.  I actually was happy to finish. I would have preferred some character background as most true crime books extensively cover the character.  This had NONE! Horrible, scattered writing.  I was having to flip back pages to see who was who.  Very disappointing, especially since I was truly intrigued by this story.  Pass on this book.. 
 This book was crazy and all over the place.  I would not recommend this book to anyone it was far to unrealistic.  The mother went from normal and sane Mother to crazy pysho killer mother in a couple pages 
 I bought this book because I liked the idea behind it, introduce the thinkers in a comic book fashion. Also, I thought the "Introducing Postmodernism" was good. But this one on Foucault is a great  dissapointment. The captions that narrate Foucault's development are mostly  confusing: the explanation of the ideas just aren't clear enough, and the  biographical anecdotes are mostly irrelevant. This doesn't give one a good  understanding of what Foucault was trying to do, what his books tried to  say, how his life influenced his work and v.v., and why, in the end, his  "work has become a straight jacket," as the author asserts 
 Flynn offers up a fast-paced, if unbelievable story.  Unfortunately, character development is paper thin and clearly portrays Flynn's political preferences.  Characters, like Rapp, with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles, have all the answers and are always showing those good-for-nothing politicians how the "real world" works.  Meanwhile, Flynn's politicians (the majority of whom are Democrats) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election.  While there are grains of truth in his characters, Flynn consistently goes for the cheap, partisan stereotype.  I was looking for a well-developed political/military thriller.  I'm still looking. 
 Anyone who's read this book, or is considering doing so, should consider what has come to light about Judith Miller's reporting in the build-up to the Iraq war (simply do a search on google for "Judith Miller" - see, in particular, the articles in Slate). Miller was regularly writing front page columns for the New York Times which contained sensational claims (now known to be wildly inaccurate) about Iraq's possession - or efforts to obtain - WMDs. One telling detail to the quality of Miller's reporting can be gleaned from her concession in May of 2003 that the now-discredited Ahmed Chalabi provided most of the scoops (aka lies) for her front page stories on WMDs.   Based on the sheer extent of errors in her pre-war reporting, I think readers of Miller's work need to utilize a heightened degree of skepticism when assessing her claims. 
 I was actually glad to read all of the low reviews because I felt like a traitor when I didn't like this book.  I wanted to like it, I really did - but it was very dull.  I ended up skimming most of it because it didn't hold my interest at all.  The first chapter started out with a bang and I was totally hooked.  It didn't take long to lose me.  Boooooring.  I didn't like Sophie, I didn't like Royd (Royd - are you kidding?  Perhaps the author should invest in a baby name book - there are much better choices for names out there.).  I wasn't interested in the direction the book went.    I thought the action scenes were ridiculous compared to the every day scenes.  If Sophie could pull off the every day scenes like she did the action scenes we wouldn't have had such a boring book.  She was da bomb during breaking and entering and getting away but she was pathetic at any other time.  Royd was so very unlikeable I couldn't believe they ended up in bed together.  Ick.  Adding Jane into the book was very contrived.  Plain old artist Jane and her cop stepfather Joe saved the boy from a ruthless trained killer?  It seemed like a ploy to connect Eve Duncan with this book.  Not at all believable.  The one sentence that I found interesting was when Michael thought that Jane resembled or looked like someone familiar.  It seemed to be a lead in to the next book.  The first IJ book I ever read was Ugly Duckling.  Hopefully IJ re-reads that one before starting the next one.  Give us a strong heroine who overcomes her trauma and kicks [...].   
 I have read many books on MPD/DID, and this one is the least interesting and helpful thus far.  I do not wish to take any personal jabs at the author, however, MPD/DID is obviously not her only disorder.  By the time you get to the end of the book and read about more post-healing "tragedies" and abuse, one gets the feeling that the author thrives on such drama.  When people write autobigraphies, they take the reader into their world. I do not wish to be dragged into this author's world.  It's not about happy endings, but it is about wanting to read truly good books written by truly healthy people who have truly overcome 
 I found the DVD to be completey inappropriate for children.  Too much violance and too much swearing.  My kids watched 5 minutes of it and its now in the garbage 
 I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I RECIEVED THE ITEM IN THE MAIL. IT WAS NOT ADVERTISED ANYWHERE ON THE PAGE THAT YOU HAD TO OWN A LEAPFROG SYSTEM IN ORDER TO USE IT. I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS A BOOK AND TAPE, AND I BOUGHT TWO 
 From this book, I learned the Famous Price-to-Rent Ratio and it comes to my mind everytime I preview a property.  It will teach you the seven things to look for in a bargain.  One of these items was new to me.  Buying REO requires two things to succeed:  expertise and money.  This book can help you with the expertise part but if you don't have some investment cash...you probably should seek another income stream.  Lucky for you (and me), real estate has several income streams to pursue.  
 There is some good stuff there, however, it is not funny, it is predictable and it is slow 
 Nickel and Dimed is about the author's experience of being a poor white women trying to pass off as a part of the working class. The book hits on several good points but she could have gotten the same information in an interview. A better book on the poor and not getting by is The Working Poor: Invisible in America 
 Poorly researched and badly organized, this book is a huge disappointment.  One of the most superficial works on this subject that I've read.  Jackson seems to be resting on past successes and offers little new or fresh in  this failed effort 
 "The Mermaid's Chair" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, "The Secret Life of Bees".  A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina.  Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally.  Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped 
 The book was easy to read but it was disappointing.  I feel like the author took single motherhood as a funny thing to laugh at.  Didn't provide much insight.  I would recommend not buying.  If you are looking for a laugh or something to just browse thru then I would spend the couple of bucks 
 This book would make a perfect gift for the wanna be intelligent idiot in your family.    Theodor Adorno use his overly complex prose to dance about linguistically and make big intelligent sounding noises. It's sure to impress anyone looking for something deep SOUNDING.  "In its absurd readiness to accept these, impotently prostrate humanity tries desperately to assimilate to experience what defies all experience"  You see?  Movies are bad.  Almost all reality changing ideas can be said with common language. So what is the purpose of this book?  Me thinks it amounts to simple written [...].    I actually burst out laughing more than a few times while reading this.   Or in the style of Mr. Adorno...   "Whereas the blank page speaks none so much as a latent novelist who has bequeathed his mightiest thoughts, so does flooding of pages with equally blank ink. This dark coloring arranged and thoroughly thought out as to light a question unto the reader in such a manner as to ask "what is the purpose of the unnecessary prose?  Thus, laughter develops, envelops and utterly denies the its intended purpose.  Namely, the communication of ideas."  Sadly, I have a feeling many literary snobs and ego-maniacs will fall for Mr. Adorno's slight-of-language tricks.   Great thoughts are best disseminated though common language.  Don't let his complex packaging fool you.  There isn't much inside.  Try reading Mises/Hazlat/Rockwell and co... 
 This magazine reads like an inflight magazine: something airlines, careful to not stir any scary adreneline rushes, put out to lull their readers to sleep. Not controversy here. No thought-provocation. Don't you wish someone out there would publish a really good magazine about books? One that featured meaty stories and well-written reviews? Well, alas, this one ain't it. It is dull and bland. Occasionally it offers up a conservative book review by neocon writer Catherine Seipp, who is about as enlightening as Bill O'Reilly (that is, entertaining and offensive and laughably stupid) so this can sometimes cut the dull. But someone here said bland and I agree. Avoid this one if you have an IQ above 90. Pick up The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly or Harper's if you like to read intelligent writing. Or, if you like romance novels, mysteries and other badly written pieces of fluff--which is all this magazine covers--this might just be the thing for you. I want my money back 
 I found this book to give only a cursory overview to some very important topics. If you're very new to computer security, and for that matter computers and IT in general, this may be a useful book. Anyone who has even a basic knowledge of computer security will not find this book useful at all 
 Probably strictly for those weird Richard Ford groupies you see at literary festivals (they must be the ones below telling you how great the pre-reviews have been--oh come on!) I'm sure these folks will welcome this last installment of the Frank Bascombe saga, as they do anything this usually engaging if often clumsy writer does. This epic may end with a whimper but for those who just don't want it to end there is at least the consolation that it's considerably longer than the earlier books. Some good moments of Ford's dry wit here, but most of the extra length is devoted to sad  ramblings in Frank's confused head.  Lots of fine American writers have succeeded portraying the heroism of the common man, but Ford seems to expect us to celebrate the common man's late-life tediousness.  That may be everyman's fate, but it's too much to ask from someone buying a book in good faith.  In the end, I wound up wishing I had stopped with Independence Day.  I could have imagined the next chapter in this life with more satisfaction than I derived from reading this droning lackluster finale. I'll give it 2 stars for sentimental reasons--guess I can't help having some compassion for guys getting old without a clue 
 Richard Dawkins is a world-class evolutionary biologist and one of the best popular science writers working today.  His "The Blind Watchmaker" is, I think, the best layman's book on natural selection ever written; I re-read it every few years just to enjoy the clarity of his style.  "A Devil's Chaplain," then, is a book I really wanted to like.  I understood walking out of the bookstore that "Chaplain" would not, in the main, be about evolutionary biology.  And I have seen enough examples of scientists -- brilliant within their own areas of expertise -- who write commonplaces or even twaddle when off their home turf.  That caution did not prepare me for the spectacle of Dawkins's plunge into unselfconscious dogmatism and graceless bile in large sections of this book.  Portions of "A Devil's Chaplain" dealing with evolutionary biology are quite good.  Sections dealing with "memes" are less satisfactory.  I actually finished Dawkins's first essay on memes _less_ convinced that they are a viable analog to genes than when I went in.  In particular, Dawkins's  postlog on why science is not a meme was unconvincing, weak argumentation at best, hand-waving at worst.  Dawkins's opinions on social institutions and politics recall William F. Buckley's  quip that it would be preferable to be ruled by citizens drawn randomly from the Boston telephone book than by the members of Harvard's faculty.  Dawkins's disparagement of the concept of trial by jury (in favor of `more rational' trial by judge) misses the point of that institution in a particularly elephantine way.  His viewpoint is elitist in a distinctively cozy, English, university-don manner.  Dawkins seems so nauseated at the thought that some gaggle of dimwitted proles might sit in judgement of _him_ that he is oblivious to the notion that an individual judge -- albeit a credentialed professional and Dr. D's intellectual equal (more or less) -- might treat him unfairly.  And some of the notions Dawkins advances are just loopy.  For instance, at one point he imagines being in the presence of a genetically-engineered approximation of an australopithecene and "tearfully taking her hand in mine" -- as if the hominid in question were an actual australopithecene, not a laboratory-made chimera, and as if the poor creature were capable of understanding his emotion, let alone reciprocating it.  "A Devil's Chaplain" is an instant classic, but not of any sort that Richard Dawkins could have intended.  With it, he joins the list of brilliant specialists who missed their opportunity to leave intact the assumption that they were sages in a broad way, instead of solely in their fields of specialization 
 The auto scan feature invariably stops on a band with interference, while I have no problem finding one manually.  The sound quality is disappointing (and yes I have a decent stereo in the vehicle) it sounds almost muffled; I still much prefer playing a CD.  This is the second monster transmitter that I have found disappointing.  It may be that all FM transmitters suffer from poor sound quality, but a few years ago in a previous vehicle the CD player that transmitted in this manner had no such problems.  Very disappointing for the money 
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 I read this book because it says it was a best seller, and the author is supposed to be one of the best at suspense.  With those expectations I was disappointed.  The author relies on gimmicks - like ultra short chapters to make it seem like you're reading faster.  Each chapter is 1 or 2 pages with at least one blank page between, so what looks like a 400 page books is really only a 250 page short novel.  One chapter is literally a cliff-hanger.  The plot's sort of a rehash of H.G. Wells' Island Of Dr. Moreau, borrowing a bit from X-Men comic books.  The mutants are all children who can fly, and they're severely persecuted by their keepers, so perhaps what makes the book appealing to other readers is the suspense derived from the endangered children angle, another cheap gimmick.    The villains are all one-dimensional stereotypes, blindly abandoning all their principles and humanity to profit off the children.  I could point out numerous flaws in style as well - but that's not the point; you could find flaws in better books too.  The point is the book is overrated for hack writing of less quality than many old pulp magazines I've read.  Even the love scenes are corny and seem like one of those cheap romance novels ("My arms were high and tight around his neck.  He pulled me against him and I felt him, all of him, against my thigh . . ."). The author also doesn't seem to understand the geography & terrain of the area he's writing about (for example, a small Sony TV won't receive Denver channels in Gunnison National Forrest, certainly not well enough to recognize faces in long shots as the author describes), and has some weird ideas of horror ("Chain link fence and concertina wire and guard dogs in the middle of the woods were scary enough, but to see the words "U.S. Government" attached to "Trespassers Will Be Shot" made me ill.").  Much more like this is topped off with a liberal dose of hypocrisy:  "The arrogance and amorality of the scientists working here affronted everything I believed in.  I wanted to find one of 'them' and strangle the person with my bare hands."   This is the last time I'll buy a book because it says "best seller."  If you want to read a well-written sci-fi suspense novel in which the protagonist is a child prodigy, I recommend The Fourth R by George O. Smith (ISBN 1557429332 - Also known as The Brain Machine, ISBN 0824014308) 
 I agree with the Kirkus review quoted above, which calls the novel A CASE OF CURIOSITY, "A leaden exercise that opens no new windows into the past [and] sometimes reads more like a museum tour." The author skillfully evokes the rude, scatological atmosphere of the 18th Century and occasionally hands the characters witty observations, ("Let us just say that Christ died for our sins. And I died for his," the Abbe sighs), but the plot isn't motored forward by a particular need. GREAT EXPECTATIONS - - which, as another reviewer pointed out, this book resembles on a surface level - - is about misplaced love and an impoverished youth becoming a gentleman. But Claude's journey in A CASE OF CURIOSITIES is about....what? (Though I read it fairly carefully, I honestly wouldn't be able to tell you what the theme of this novel is.) I am now going to discuss a story point that I hope will illustrate the writer's shaky hold on plot development, though if you haven't read the book, you might want to stop reading here: The young hero has fled his childhood village after a break with his mentor in his teens. Years later, the groundwork is laid for the rift to be mended after a fire sweeps through the town and Claude returns to check on his family. Could there be a more random, extraneous motivator for a reunion than that? The book features occasionally moving passages, ("There is in the pawnbroker's shop a profound and illicit sadness, a concentrated dose of personal failure."), but since the story isn't building toward anything, there would be no need to pick it up again if you set it down in the middle. If I hadn't had to finish reading it for work, I know that I wouldn't have 
 Craig Fuller makes $3 million a year as chief of the National Association of Chain Drug Stores. After perusing this tome, it is clear that writing lucid narrative prose is not part of his job description. Of course it is a typical Washington pretense to assume that every thought one has is profound and must be committed to print; after all, they're paying me three mil, so random musings that carom through my brainpan must be insightful!  Alas, as this embarrassing volume shows, this pretense is exactly that -- a pretense. This collection of cliches, shopworn positive thinking bromides, and other half-baked attempts at homey wisdom comes off as nothing but pure wind. Fuller makes no original observations about anything, though he certainly had ample opportunity to do so (Vioxx anyone?).  And so, let us please observe a moment of silence for the trees murdered so senselessly only so Fuller could commit his vacuous brain droppings to print. Indeed, the existence of this book is so tragic, and bodes so poorly for the future of Western civilization, that let us also say a silent prayer for the sacrifices of the ink and glue.  
 I purchased Thomas' book with high hopes that it would be a reasoned, intelligent review of the history of Mossad, one of the world's most effective intelligence services, along the lines of Israel's Secret War's.  Sadly, such was not the case.  Thomas is a conspiracy theorist who relies on innuendo and rumor to justify mindless theories and meaningless concepts, all in lieu of research and facts to tell what is an incredible story on its own.  From little things, like referring to the Echelon surveillance system operated by the National Security Agency as monitoring every conversation between every individual virtually anywhere in the world (Echelon monitors electronic conversations, not every possible conversation) to secondhand references to the late William Casey, the then-director of the CIA, as suggesting that Mossad supplied arms to Hezbollah in the early 1980's when Israel invaded Lebanon, Thomas studiously avoids anything approaching professionalism or reasoned analysis.  Mossad is a rich topic for investigation, and there are excellent treatments on the subject.  Thomas, unfortunately, is an unprofessional, sloppy and pathetic writer whose book demeans its subject 
 Charles Bukowski is a writer.  He's not the type to go to writers clubs, instead he drank, as most good writers do - and a lot of bad ones I suppose.  He's dead now, so it's ok to like him.  I was making my way through the lot of his novels - his Novels because I hate poetry -  `Postal Service' is his best so far. What negated `Ham on Rye' in my opinion was his EMPHASIS on just how hard his life was as a child growing up in a loveless household.  Bukowski is a person who values the idea of individualism.  It is hard for me to fully respect a man who calls himself an individual and a `tough guy,' who so obviously blames his parents for his attitude towards the world.  Directly after this book I read Celine's `Death on the Installment Plan,' an author recommended by Bukowski as being one of his consistent favorites.  I can understand that, because Celine's childhood was much the same; poor, loveless, solitary - in short a joy to read.  Of course `Ham on Rye' is well written, you get a very strong sense of voice and tone from all of his books.  He's one of the few authors that are fun to read aloud to yourself because there's a definite beat and rhythm to his narrative process.  Not a bad book, on the grand scheme, but it showed me a side of this man who lived a `hard' life, who takes the easy way out and blames his childhood for being the character that he is. 
 AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN OUT OF THE SPORT FOR 10 YEARS AND LOOKING TO GET BACK IN, I BOUGHT THIS BOOK EXPECTING MORE. THE BOOK STARTS OUT WITH A GOOD HISTORY OF THE 3 WHEELED ATV, BUT DOESN'T ELABORATE TOO MUCH ON QUADS. (WHAT ABOUT THE MID 80'S SUZUKI'S - QUAD SPORT/QUAD RACER?)  ANOTHER DOWN FALL OF THE BOOK  IS THAT IT STRONGLY FOCUSES ON UTILITY ATV'S AND RARELY MENTIONS SPORT MODELS. AS FAR AS THE MAINTENANCE SECTION OF THE BOOK... IT ... 
 A babbling stream of zen consciousness nonsense.   This book may be interesting to those who like new age poetry but if you're primarily looking to improve your writing craft - seek elsewhere.  There are a few nuggets of helpful wisdom here, but they are buried by reams of meandering memoir 
 If I could give this book zero stars, I would do so. There's barely a plot: the protagonist, Janie, marries three men and kills the last one because he gets rabies. The end. Janie is the ultimate antiheroin. She comes off as this oppressed little wife who takes forever to speak out against her husbands. It would have been better if Alice Walker had not "found" Zora Hurston and brought this awful book back into the public. 
 OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.  The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?  Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics 
 I learned a lot of information about Kepler, Kepler's family, the thirty-years war, and the counter-reformation. The writer's prose was very readable; however, the book lacked cohesion. The book had very little information concerning with Kepler developing his scientific theories and his search for harmony. The author jumped off on bunny trails for scores of pages without mentioning Kepler. He would write about the thirty years war and the political machinations that led up to it. He would then return to the witch trial of Kepler's mother. He would then breifly spend a little time on Kepler developing his theories and how it relates to his faith. The book seemed repetitious at times. Maybe bacause the witch trial went on for so long, but the book returns again and again to that same topic and how worried and frantic Kepler was.  I had a hard time finishing it. The book was a hard read. At the end, I had a hard time placing  all the pieces together. The topic was fascinating and the author did provide some interesting tidbits, but the narrative thread was hard to follow 
 Well, I just had to try another Dr. Phil book, since it has been a number of years since I read Life Strategies. To be honest, even though he can be a polarizing figure, I have nothing against him. I think his TV is a source of help and inspiration for thousands of people.  This book however, was a real struggle to complete. It was not coherently structured, and the author kept saying things like "This book will show you...." all the way through the book. It felt like I never left the "Introduction" and he was continually trying to convince me (or himself) that this book really would eventually get to the point and that the point would be profound. Instead it really couldn't ever get moving and instead often relied on crass language as a weak attempt to get the reader's attention.  Fret not! There are other books out there that tackle the same general issue, but are far better reads. I recommend:  1. Failing Forward, by John C. Maxwell 2. Today Matters, by John C. Maxwell  Again, I have no issue with the author, and applaud his efforts. However, in writing a review to my fellow Amazon customers, I must strongly recommend that you spend your time on more impactful literature within this genre. Best of success to you in reaching your goals 
 The section on spreadsheet is terribly outdated - obsolete even. It's  pretty much like a basic reference for financial modelling but does not  really provide the step by step approach to the topic. Sorry but I don't  think you will find useful tips on financial forecasting here 
 This book's title is deceptive in that it suggests the author is going to examine the place of capitalism within formal Catholic social thought.  Sadly, Dr. Woods foregoes the opportunity to examine the teachings of the social magisterium in favor of the standard bromides of the Austrian school.  Admitting at the outset that he's no intention of bringing up the pronouncements of the popes throughout the ages, he instead nit picks about the sorts of things which have traditionally annoyed Austrians.  In most things, Woods follows the lead of others, contributing nothing himself in the way of original analysis.  He acknowledges his intellectual debt to Murray Rothbard in the introduction and, later on, draws on Rothbard's arguments concerning the 16th century scholastics, some of whom wrote opinions in accord with Austrianism.  Unfortunately, a few 16th century theologians does not the Church make and it's of course silly to even think that these men, grounded as they were in the thought of the Angelic Doctor, would in any way endorse Austrianism or the anarcho-capitalism of Murray Rothbard.  It would be the equivalent of saying that the popes are Austrian because they view private property as a pillar of society.  Nonsense!    According to Rothbard, the error of Thomists and all classical natural-law theorists is that they viewed the state as a "major locus of virtuous action".  Elsewhere, Rothbard defines the state as a monopolistic criminal enterprise.  Each of these views is well outside of the social magisterium; no where will you find a pope who rejects the validity of the state since it holds authority by the will of God.  St. Paul addresses the state in Romans 13, not the all-powerful market, and he does not fall on the side of Murray Rothbard.  The errors of the non-Catholic Rothbard on political issues are not enough to persuade Woods that he's suspect as an authority in economics.  He clings instead all the more tightly to the luminaries of Austrianism in a book ostensibly dedicated to Catholic social teaching on economic concerns.  For myself, if I detect a serious error in the realm of political theory on the part of a writer, I become very cautious in following his lead in economic matters.  Rothbard's political views are inseparable from his economic theory since the state exists solely to destroy the fruits of the market (cf. Man, Economy & State).    The supreme irony is that Dr. Woods continues to defend the compatibility of Austrianism and Catholicism, even against the condemnations of economic liberalism by popes like Pius XI, to whom Woods appeals against the errors and confusion which have plagued the post-conciliar Church (cf. The Great Facade).  Here, Pius XI addresses Woods and his ilk in his encyclical letter Ubi Arcano Dei:  "Many believe in or claim that they believe in and hold fast to Catholic doctrine on such questions as social authority, the right of owning private property, on the relations between capital and labor, on the rights of the laboring man, on the relations between Church and State, religion and country, on the relations between the different social classes, on international relations, on the rights of the Holy See and the prerogatives of the Roman Pontiff and the Episcopate, on the social rights of Jesus Christ, Who is the Creator, Redeemer, and Lord not only of individuals but of nations. In spite of these protestations, they speak, write, and, what is more, act as if it were not necessary any longer to follow, or that they did not remain still in full force, the teachings and solemn pronouncements which may be found in so many documents of the Holy See, and particularly in those written by Leo XIII, Pius X, and Benedict XV.  There is a species of moral, legal, and social modernism which We condemn, no less decidedly than We condemn theological modernism."  Liberalism takes many forms.  In our own day, most faithful Catholics assume it is primarily concerned with corruptions of human sexuality.  In fact, the popes remind the faithful that liberalism appears under varied guises.  Dr. Woods evinces a poor philosophical foundation and he is easily taken in by all sorts of assumptions.  For example, Ludwig von Mises, critical inspiration to Rothbard and other Austrians, claims in his work Human Action that praxeology "is the science of every kind of human action", rejecting any who would claim that his new science, heretofore unknown to the doctors of the Church, is not limited to those actions which lead to an improvement in a man's material well-being.  This claim of course is fundamentally at odds with St. Thomas and Catholicism at both a natural and theological level.  From a Thomistic perspective, one wonders how anyone can have a perfect science of all human action that does not weigh good or bad actions.  This is true whether it's philosophical ethics or evangelical precepts.  The error of the past, says Mises, is that philosophers like Aristotle sought to explain human action by notions of good or bad, just or unjust, or even worse, the "interference" of a Deity.  Instead, human actions are not ordered by objective valuations, but rather by the dictates of the market.  Virtue and vice are subjective notions which have no place in economics.  If a man is to "succeed" says Mises, he must adjust his actions to economic law.  In his intro to Human Action, he uses the example of a man who wants frequent sexual intercourse: if he's going to get it, he's going to have to know economics.  Austrian economics, not Chicago economics.  Elsewhere, he quips that "simple faith and economic rationalism cannot dwell together.  It is unthinkable that priests should govern entrepreneurs."  Meaning, the Church has no business at all talking about the market.  The social magisterium is just so many opinions which may or may not be the correct way to establish a just and felicitous social order.  Rothbardians would go further and say that the Church can be ignored without moral peril whenever She posits the notion of a common good capable of being guarded by the state.    Woods argues that economics is not a species of ethics but is instead a pure science studied in the same way that physics is by physicists.  As St. Thomas says, "external goods that are used purposively by men have a moral consideration."  It's precisely this ethical cast that Mises and other Austrians have sought to banish from economics.  The Church has claimed the right to decide the moral lights which should guide Christians in formulating a just economic order.  Woods does not meditate upon the question of whether there is a moral calculus in the laws which the state passes to regulate the exchange of goods or in relations between labor and capital.  How can he?  His mentor Rothbard had already taught that the state was criminal by nature so it follows that its decrees are only the threats of a crime syndicate having a monopoly on the use of violence.  Rothbard took Mises to his logical conclusion, deciding that the market would necessarily find the most humane and efficient way to secure corporate goods with the state tagging along as an unwanted parasite.  Woods uses the same line of thought in his discussion on safety regulations.  The market will always do a better job of implementing safety in the workplace than any public regulation because it is rational.  If an objective moral evil exists in the social order, it cannot be addressed by a ruler or rulers.  The market is infallible and will eventually solve any problem, whether it takes days or decades.  Positive laws to remedy or palliate a condition are by definition always worse than doing nothing.  It's kind of like a doctor telling his patient to forego any treatment since death will eventually cure his illness.  Woods wants us to accept that economics is a value-free science, a set of observations about the way things work in a world marred by scarcity.  At the same time, he can't help dipping into moral considerations (e.g, p. 47), predicating moral or immoral of certain economic choices.  In addition, he favorably quotes the Jesuit Mariana, who calls any ruler "wicked" who sets a price by edict.  Mises and Rothbard of course also resorted to various moral arguments when discoursing on economics; their gift for moralistic psychologizing has been picked up by anarchists like Hans Hoppe at UNLV.  The question is then:  whose morals guide the discussion?  Are they Catholic?  Do they reflect the mind of the Church in her magisterium and her liturgy (cf. The Feast of Christ the King)?  The Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, used by Byzantine Catholics, is very un-Rothbardian: the priest prays for the good of the civil authorities and the armed forces, major no-no's in Murray Rothbard's School of Politico-Economic Anarchy.  Passages like 1 Peter 2:13 become problematic at best, candidates for expunging at worst.  To be deep in Austrianism is to cease to be Catholic.  At the very least, we can dispense with the pretension that economics is just a pure science about the way things are.  This claim can also be found in fields like sociology and psychology.  It's foolish to predicate pure value-neutrality of the political science, but the Economic Man is a powerful myth, so it happens that the whole science of economics gets a pass when it does this very thing.  The Austrian School is a marginal school at best (no pun intended), with Noble Laureates and scholars coming from other schools like Chicago.  The variety of theories would suggest that economics is a science in an equivocal sense only.    Woods has repeatedly shown that he's out of his depth in tackling the question of the Church and the market.  For those who accept Woods' thesis, think more carefully about it after reading Rothbard and Mises.  Both authors have good insights and much of what they write is reasonable when they discuss the minutiae, but this book is nothing more than an Austrian primer.  Woods limits much of his effort to sniping at individuals like Belloc.  Heinrich Pesch gets two whole pages even though he's hugely influential in 20th century Catholic social thought. One senses that Woods is really only interested in regurgitating standard Austrian doctrine.  We don't need this book for that purpose since many others have already been written.  A concise but potent antidote to Austrian ideology is the recently released Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church.  Unlike this book, it actually delves into the heart of the Church's teaching on economic, political and cultural issues.  Citations are copious and far ranging and, alas, authoritative.   
 I found this book dissappointing. It overstates the obvious. Unless you are totally clueless and never had to pick up your room as a kid, you probably know all this stuff already. A waste of money 
 According to Armstrong ADD is a conspiracy theory?  I just couldn't get past that!  I looked at a few of the 50 ways... Less TV?  Do you really need to include that?  Common sense!! 
 Raise the Red Lantern is a wonderful movie with a great story.  When I had heard that this movie was going to be transfered to DVD format, I was thrilled. And then I bought the DVD, and to my dismay, within the first couple of minutes into the movie, there were white lines and distortion. Since I loved the movie so much, I thought I would make an exception for the first few minutes, but as the movie continued, so did the white lines.  I could not believe what I was seeing.  The DVD copy of this movie, reminded me of the old movies I use to see years ago, when there were only 7 channels on TV. And not only is the visual appearance of this movie distorted so is the sound. It's very harsh and nasally. I am on my way out the door to return this DVD and ask for a refund. 
 I have owned this book for a long time....I am just starting to read it.  After the cover the lay out of the book is so difficult that I have been unable to read more than a few pages at a time. The lines are so long that you cannot read them comfortably. All of the pages are so dense that there is no breathing or white space.   I fully anticipated photos and/or illustrations since the book is indeed about design and the business of art cards and similar products.  I agree that designing the book in a new format and adding a few illustrations could certainly improve the impact of such a meaningful story.  Keep your dough and look elsewhere for inspiration.  
 ...and I suppose that's what I get for judging it by its cover. I expected the book to be funny bordering on side-splitting since Peck has been compared to Erma Bombeck. But where Bombeck was hilariously wise and self-deprecating without groveling, it's hard to believe Peck is in her 50s. While reading I kept picturing a kid with a copy of "Increase Your Vocabulary Overnight!" trying too hard to be funny -- her writing is often irritatingly choppy and even worse, contrived.   Apparently the book was originally written just for the amusement of family and friends, and perhaps I am being unfair by virtue of my own high expectations. But more often than not, Peck's stories fall flat into that stale silence immediately following what *you* thought was funny, yet wind up red-faced and mumbling, "Well, guess you had to be there... 
 Will somebody please tell me what the appeal is? Yes, I know it's a classic. But it's a really, really boring classic. The prequel to Charlotte Bronte's, Jane Eyre, is the story of Bertha Mason's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why Bertha went nuts. It's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they didn't like little French girls in Jamaica. Racism, sexism, and classism drove Bertha `round the bend. There. I've saved you the trouble of reading it. Now re-read Jane Eyre instead 
 This book is an outcome of the Copenhagen Consensus 2004. Eight economists ranked 38 proposals for spending $50 billion to address ten problems - climate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, access to education, financial instability, government corruption, hunger, migration, sanitation and clean water, and subsidies and trade barriers.  The book proposes that these problems - many caused by globalisation, or imperialism as we call it - can only be solved by more globalisation. But are they really global problems, needing global solutions? Aren't these problems spread unevenly across the world's nations? Shouldn't every people make their own assessment of what they must do to improve their lives?  The idea of ranking problems across the world ignores countries' different needs. Each country should decide how much to spend on what. It would be silly to put all their money into preventing diseases, and spend nothing on clean water.   The economists supported public, not private, health services, "Health economists almost universally accept that market failures in health are so great that governments must intervene." But they ranked trade liberalisation third and easier migration for skilled workers tenth. Don't free movements of capital and labour cause problems? As one of them, Jan Pronk, wrote, "Financial and monetary instabilities increase with globalisation, and economic inequality as well" and "Market reforms can lead to ... more rather than less poverty. ... in Africa and South Asia urban and rural poverty increased."   Some of the economists observed that capital controls shielded countries from shocks caused by capital movements. Some noted that migration of professional people from South to North robs developing countries of the fruits of their investment, and reduces wages, and increases profits, in the developed countries. Others believed that the more open the economy, the less unequal and corrupt it was, which would be news to Enron workers in the USA.   The economists ranked at 16th, 17th and 18th proposals to address climate change - two forms of carbon tax, and implementing the Kyoto Pact. "The panel recognised that global warming must be addressed, but agreed that approaches based on too abrupt a shift towards lower emissions of carbon were needlessly expensive."  Finally, though, they did not recognise that some countries do the lot, without aid and without the advice of foreign economists. Cuba, for instance, controls diseases through its universal health services, prevents conflicts, educates all its people, has stable finances, curbs corruption, feeds its people, controls migration, ensures sanitation and clean water for all, and controls pollution. It supports its industries and controls capital and trade. Cuba disproves the book's assumption that capitalism is the best, indeed the only, choice for us all. 
 This man lives in a world od distorted reality.  Economic equality and poverty is bound to exist reguardless of the mode of production.  Capitalism allows democracy, which is the most important issue to me.  He talks about Cuba in this book...  The have to give up freedom and live in poverty, but their literacy level is the same as our's; which system sounds better?  Tjis was a well written book wth ample information, so I probably should have rated it better.  However, I hate the message that it sends 
 I was waiting eagerly for this CD to be released, but when I finally got it I was majorly dissapointed.  How can this even be called Bad Boy's R&B HITS?  The Puffy, B.I.G. and Mase songs are all hip hop, and don't belong on the R&B hits CD.  The Mary J. Blige and Jodeci songs are both from Uptown, not Bad Boy, therefore should not be considered one of Bad Boy's hits.  That Cheri Dennis song was not a hit, hell was it even a single?  As much as I love New Edition, this song was not released as a single and should not be considered one of Bad Boy's hits, at least not yet.    I was expecting to actually see the Bad Boy R&B hits from the past 10 years when I heard of this title.  Where's Only You from 112?  Or You Used to Love Me by Faith?  Where'd Total go?  The only 4 songs on here that can even be considered Bad Boy R&B hits are the 2 songs by Faith and the 2 by 112, the rest of the album is garbage.  This album is something that seems thrown together in a hurry to rush out and get sales for Xmas, but save your money because it's not worth it.  There were only 12 songs on the CD, and only 4 of them were actually R&B hits from Bad Boy artists.  Puffy's being cheap here, there should have been 16-18 songs including 2 or 3 of Total's hits, 3 or 4 from 112 including their biggest hit in Only You that isn't even included in this collection, another 3 or 4 from Faith including her earlier hits from the first and best album with maybe I Love You and Never Let You Go, maybe 2 songs from Carl Thomas, 2 from Dream, and possibly Hot2Nite from New Edition since it's a recent hit.  I don't know how people could be writing good reviews for this album before it's release date, they must not have seen the horrible track list yet.  I was expecting a lot more from this, hoping to get all the R&B hits from the first 10 years.  You could, and should have, done a lot better with this, Puffy 
 You have to understand: I am not an Adam Sandler fan. I didn't like him on Saturday Night Live. I don't like his stand-up comedy. I didn't like Happy Gilmore. I didn't like Waterboy. I didn't like Mr. Deeds. (Though... I did like the Wedding Singer, but I take that as the exception that proves the rule...) It was to be expected, going in, that I wouldn't like Billy Madison. And, I didn't.  But maybe you *are* an Adam Sandler fan, like the friend of mine who convinced me to take this chance on Sandler. If so, you'll probabaly really like this movie (it's his favorite of the Sandler films). I'd say that, if you're a Sandler fan, you can add two stars to my review for a total of four.  Sandler is really himself in this film, doing his schtick. For instance, early on he sings a pointless, off-key ode to sunscreen. Sandler fans find that kind of thing funny; I don't. I think that's the barometer for this movie--ask yourself: guy singing about sunscreen, just 'cause. Funny? If so, get this movie.  To get into specifics, Billy Madison is about the title character (Sandler), heir to his father's multi-million dollar corporation, who is in danger of losing out on his inheritance because he's uneducated and unmannered and, in general, a big layabout who spends his days sunbathing and drinking (and singing about sunscreen). Billy makes a deal with his dad that the business will go to him if he manages to pass each grade, 1-12, with 2 weeks for each grade. I hope I'm not spoiling too much to say that: Billy wins in the end, gets the girl (a very hot elementary school teacher) and sticks it to the bad guy (an unscrupulous businessman, scheming to "steal" the business away from Billy).  I found the plot unrealistic. What the hell does it mean to "pass" 12th grade in 2 weeks... and more than that, Madison starts out unable to spell the word "rock" (his version: "rok"); do we really believe he could turn that around so quickly? I found Sandler's character inconsistent. One second he's a spastic moron, the next he's a relatively decent, sensitive guy, and there's no real reason to believe they're the same person. I found the humor lame--jokes revolve around ugly homosexuals finding Billy attractive and little kids pissing on themselves.  None of this will matter to the Sandler fan, but those on the fence might take note.  Some positives include two of the supporting cast--Norm McDonald (who needs to work more) and Chris Farley's brief appearance (who is missed). Also, the teacher/love-interest *is* really hot.  Sandler Fans: 4 Stars.  Everyone Else: 2 Stars 
 There has been a book out before this one, by the same publisher, (DIFFERENT AUTHOR!) with the same graphics and cover layout, with the difference that the OTHER book is titled Electronic GADGETS For The Evil Genius.   This one replaces the word GADGETS with CIRCUITS.  The OTHER book is a great book, about exactly what the title says, but THIS book is very DECEPTIVE!!    THERE ARE NO EVIL CIRCUITS OR PLANS IN THIS BOOK AT ALL!!!  All this is, is a high school basic electronics text book, teaching what resistors and transistors are and how they work, written by a high school shop teacher!  If, like me, you bought the first book, and thought this one was going to show more evil "mad scientist" like devices to build, you will be VERY DISSAPOINTED!!  Apparently, this is going to be a series of books (sort of like the "IDIOT'S GUIDE TO" books and each will be written by a different author.  At the begining of the book, it lists SIX MORE books like this that will be released in 2005.  Most people who buy this book, will already know basic electronics and will be buying it to build evil projects.   Yet, this is only a book teaching very basic electronics at a grade school level, and the projects in it are nothing more than connecting LEDs to a switch and battery! (VERY EVIL!)  The first half of the book is nothing but introducing you to parts like resistors, LEDs and transistors and their schematic symbols.  The second half gets into things like NAND GATES and OP AMPS.     Here are some of the "evil" projects in this book:  Running a seven segment LED display. Night Light. Using a speaker as a microphone. Sound Buzzer. and of course, how to connect an LED to a switch and battery.  If you are looking for a book on how to build evil projects, then you want the OTHER book.  If you know absolutely nothing about electronics, and want to learn the real BASIC stuff, then this book might be interesting to you.   But how DECEPTIVE to use the same cover art and make it appear to be another volume with evil projects like the FIRST book was.    If you find this book in a store, be VERY CAREFULL to look for the word GADGETS and not CIRCUITS as they both look almost exactly the same otherwise!  They NEVER should have put the phrase "Evil Genius" on this book at all!    Nothing EVIL about it, and any "Genius" already knows everything that is taught in this book!  
 Having worked on the launch of Armstrong's Apollo 11, I have more than a passing knowledge of the technical and historical facts about Apollo.  That said, I finally gave up listing the errors I found in this book.  While I think I learned new info about Armstrong, it is tainted by the many other errors.  I found it to be written in several styles, often much more complex than it needed to be.   Save your money for the real Armstrong book due out soon 
 As somebody who essentially can 'pick up chicks' I found this book to be a moderately funny read for when you come back from the bar feeling drunk, but it is nowhere near being a serious  guide for actually attracting/picking up/seducing women. If you really are looking to improve with women try books by Ross Jeffries, Neil Strauss or Steve Horsfal 
 Much Ado About Nothing could possibly be the worst Shakespeare story of all time.  The words were so hard to pronounce and the dialogue between characters is so bad.  I have more intresting conversations with myself.  The whole plot was just stupid.  Don Pedro came home from war, and his brother Don Jon was plotting to overthrow him.  There were two couples in the story who sort of fell in love.  Benedick and Beatrice were sort of an older couple who showed their affection for each other in a "retarded" way.  They made fun of each other to hide the fact that they liked each other.  That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.  What was Shakespeare smoking when he wrote this?  It's beyond me.  Anyway, Benedick and Beatrice end up falling in love.  This other couple, Hero and Claudio are sort of young and know that they like each other.  Don Jon has this idea to make Claudio hate Hero.  One night, Don Jon gets his boy to have sex with this other girl, Margret, and call her Hero so that Claudio will think it's her and deny her at the wedding the following day.  It works, but then the Friar convinces everyone that it was all just a plan by Don Jon.  So then Benedick tells Don Jon that his punishment will be determinded the following day and that's how this book ends.    Don't read it unless you want to experience the most boring 80 pages of your life.  I recommend this to no one, unless you're into really bad books 
 After reading this iconic work, I felt as if I had been ripped off with only myself to blame.  I should have known better.  The book is SOOOOOOO 70's!  I'll give it two stars simply because it's really so out-of-date it's almost campy.    Okay, early oil paintings depicted the upper classes with their "stuff" and the "stuff" of the upper classes.  So?  It's pretty elemental to figure out that those painters had to make a living and they painted for those who were able to pay them.    Duh.  Okay, women were depicted in oil paintings as possessions and, in turn, viewed themselves in the light of the value the possessor placed on them.  Deep and enlightening, huh?  It gets worse.  We get a healthy dose of the "capitalism is bad" philosophy and the hammering that advertising is meant to keep the masses enslaved to capitalism.  Nineteen seventies style collectivism is so boring.  Of course, Berger offers no alternative other than some passing reference to his vague definition of democracy.      Maybe it's just so out-dated, it's no longer relevant.  Maybe it played better to the 1970's.  Maybe we've heard this claptrap for so many years, it's no longer novel or meaningful.  And, maybe, it's because we've matured enough to realize criticism without any offering of alternatives is simply disingenuous and superficial 
 all i got to say about this is that dudes need to stop making this kinds of records cuz this is not hip hop, its not what LL, Rakim, KRS-one, Kool G Rap, Ice T, Ice Cube, NWA, and (rip) BIG AND PAC, started.  We as fan have the power to end this buy simply not buying the album.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS, THIS FAKE RAP IS GOT TO STO 
 What a slog it is trying to get through this book. I'm nearly there (I've read 3 or 4 other books since starting this)... the reason for my stubbornness in finishing it is that it came so highly recommended by friends, and the mostly rave reviews it's got here. Ignatius Reilly, the main character is interesting enough (that's why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star) but that has a lot to do with the fact that the rest of the cast and plot is so boring, I find myself flicking on the pages to see how far I have to go before the story gets back to Ignatius again. I keep thinking "OK, the side splitting stuff must be coming up soon"...there are humourous passages here and there but nothing to merit the accolades it has received here nor winning the Pulitzer Prize. I'm at a loss to explain its popularity 
 I have used Lonely Planet travel guides for years.  Yet, I am sorry to say that this one is a real let down.  The lay out is not user friendly.  The print styles are very difficult to read.  The book is not directed to the outdoors person as was the hallmark of the series.  I was throughly dissappointed in this guide.  The Moon guide is a vastly superior guide to this area 
 For Sherlock Holmes' fans following Basil and Jeremy, this flick fails ! Attempts to comic and spoof roles played by Rathbone and Brett doesn't work. This is a film that once seen probably not in line for a second viewing. Not worthy of a Wilder performance  
 I was intrigued by the concept of a detective mystery set in Tang Dynasty China.  Unfortunately the author hasn't mastered the essentials of writing a really good novel.  The characters didn't feel believable, the dialogue is stiff and unnatural, and the plot is slow-moving and contrived 
 This movie must be restored--the quality of picture is unacceptable beginning with Bloody Mary's singing Bali Hi. I tried to purchase a completely restored, digitally remastered DVD of this musical and could not find one in 2007.  I returned this DVD to the seller 
 I was very dissapointed with this book. It isn't even well written. I was expecting a solid history of the Myrtles and I got a history of the author. There is sexual content that adds absolutely nothing to the story. I wasn't at all interested in a description of her husbands backside as he made love to her friend. That tells the story of the Myrtles----how? The book isn't at all scary or creepy. The people who found it so must scare easily.It is mostly laughable.Keep your money in your pocket and pass this one by 
 Based on her own definition in this book, Ms. Coulter is liberal to the core. "If you cannot articulate your opponent's position, you are not an adult; you are a liberal."   Ms. Coulter is an articulate author with an admirable command of language. Her twists of the literary knife  are a pleasure to read, even when you realize that she has severed your necktie. Or your intestine. She has a penchant for making the same point three or five or six times using eight or twelve or twenty examples, which is about as pleasant as watching a pile driver hammer a steel rod into granite.  Her thesis is that the political opinions of mainstream American media are more liberal than those of mainstream America, affecting both the choice and treatment of news topics. She raises some cogent and disturbing points. Her opening  line, "Political debate in this country is insufferable," makes clear that she can and does address fundamental problems that transcend the issues of the moment.  She also identifies the cause of these problems in her first paragraph: "It's all liberal's fault." She judges the value of any action entirely by the political stance of the actor, regardless of the action itself. Liberals who characterize conservatives as "dumb" (i.e. every liberal, everywhere) are attacking their opponents personal traits because they are unable to create or express any meaningful arguments. She does not apply the same logic to her own statement such as "All liberals hate America," or "Liberals love pedophiles." She is certainly skilled in logic, as revealed in a hair-splitting analysis of why it is reprehensible for liberals to describe right wing ideas as "Nazi" in nature, but Rush Limbaugh's term "femin-Nazi" is a discerning and accurate characterization.  
 There has to be something else to write about for the X-Men, right?  Even the characters are commenting about how they're tired of fighting the Phoenix.  Along with this comes a series of storylines (Shiar, Quentine Quire, Jean/Scott/Emma) that seems to never come together until they are mashed at the end.  The art is beautiful to be sure, but the character rendering isn't the best.  I can't seem to recognize the characters faces. 
 I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.  Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing.   In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it 
 We bought the scale for starting Weight watchers but it does not do  weights in fractions i.e. 1/4 lb etc. Also it was not as pictured. The look of the scale(in the photo)was appealing because of the retro look with the red dial, ours came with a black dial which is just plane boring.  Average thought...its just an average scale and nothing more 
 As far as I know, this is the first book on SQLite and for that Chris Newman deserves a compliment. Beyond that, this book is not very useful though: 1) It explains some basic SQL syntax but I didn't buy this book to learn SQL. 2) Very little information about the specifics and pitfalls of SQLite syntax, I rarely find what I'm looking for. 3) Being a PHP developer I don't need the chapters on C++, Perl, TCL and Python (about 25% of the book) 
 Alright, for those of you who say Rand is criticizing works for false ideals, or lacking in substance, I say this: who is Rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are?  Who is Rand to say what substance is?  You've got to look at her bias, first.  Realize that Rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom.  As if outside factors never matter; and maybe they don't, for her.  Maybe her life in an oppressive Russia did nothing to form who she is today.  But I doubt it.  Though I believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live, outside influences do affect a person.  But she doesn't.  Thus she condemns all works that are not driven solely by the individual as crap.  All books that are not driven solely by the individual's sense of reason: don't read, cause it will lessen your IQ.    Any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she doesn't find worthwhile or cannot understand, she condemns.  Rand, at least as portrayed in what I've read of her work, is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants.  And this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes.  They cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of quality, they are either good or worthless.   The pieces of art she says are empty ARE empty, absolutely.  They don't fit into her paradigm thus have nothing to offer.  Nothing to offer her, that is.    How is a completely selfish person supposed to write a critique of history's best books, telling OTHER people (with different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an individual) What they should read?  Truthfully any criticism in this form, like a list I saw detailing the 100 best literary works in the world, is elitist crap trying to close people's minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others.  They have their bias like anyone else.  I say read in variety.  Observe art outside of Rand's choice of art.  Take in all you can, with an open mind, then start pondering whether you agree or not.  If you then agree because YOU agree, then I say great.  Its the basic individualistic response that Rand seems to forget to address.  She says question society, but by my line of inquiry.  She says be an individual, but only I know the basis of who you want to be 
 It's entirely unfortunate that Garrard has come to be considered the be-all-end-all of Gentilleschi scholarship.  While the hefty opus features a wealth of research and a moderately well-illustrated span of pages, Garrard's feminist arguments do not line up. Citing the artist's "rape" by Tassi as a motivating force in the creation of her paintings featuring strong female characters, Garrard corners much of her argument on the Susanna and the Elders Gentilleschi painted a full year before the encounter with Tassi.  Further, Garrard casts a 20th century feminist eye, and an accusatory one at that, upon the artist and her situation. She hardly considers the psychology of the 17th century, nor the legal definitions, where "rape" and its current emotional and psychological ramifications were hardly present. Indeed, court documents and statements show the artist and her father suing for marriage to save the family name; not once is there a mention of emotional hardship, but instead purely economic. Other sources depict a heated, smitten Artemisia, who continued her affair with Tassi for a year before discovered by her father, exposed, and forced to bring legal action against tassi. Conlusion: 400 years ago, forced sexual acts had not the same social identification of today, the psychology was different, and, honestly, Garrard neglects to illustrate the other sides of Artemesia and focuses on one event defining a life of artistic creation that, while reasonable for a 20th century situation, is unfounded for a Baroque 
 This book sucks..........Schwartz is impossible to read!  I tried to read The Living Energy Universe, and the Afterlife Experiments, which I could not finish....when a friend gave me the TRUTH to read I thought it would be lighter and more fun, but I was wrong, I could not finish it either.  Schwartz is definitely not a writer 
 Wow I thought THULE was THE company for this type of stuff.  Boy was I mad after a trip from NJ to SC.  The bag was mounted to my roofrack and was a little noisy (top be expected).  But when I got to SC and opened the bag....the horror!  The inside lining shredded and flaked off on everything!   There were also 2 holes along the to seam!  What a mess...and I couldn't use the bag on the way home....had to ship my stuff home!  I just wrote THULE....we'll see if they come thru for the customer  Sept. 12, 2005 THULE sent me a replacement, an Escape 2.  Great customer service....but does this mean the Escape is better?  Is the Quest inferior?  There was no coorespondence with the repalcement...I'll try it out this summer 
 I'm an atheist, so, you might say I'm predisposed to dislike this work. Perhaps, but I tried as best as possible to evaluate it on its own merits -- it has little to speak of.  I've run into some "Presuppositionalists" and the net.  I decided to try to find something defending it written by someone with some explanatory skills -- just to try to understand it more. So, I was led to this book, as, according to Bahnen's fans, his works explain and defend Van Til's theology the best.   On the back of the book, it says he's got a PhD in philosophy from Southern Cal, specializing in epistemology no less!  (Epistemology is a branch of philosophy dealing with the nature of knowledge, how we know things.) Holy smokes, a PhD specialist in epistemology defending Presuppositionalism! If anybody can do, it would seem that this is the man, no? Well, no.  Man, what a drag. The guy's writing style isn't too bad, its a pretty easy read. But he says the same bloody thing over and over and over and over and over and over again. And then he says it again.  He says a lot of the things I've heard claimed by other presuppers I've run into say, like that all other worldviews must be self-contradictory. But he just asserts it and doesn't defend it.  As far as defending the basic idea of presuppositionalism, he says that everyone must accept certain things as self-evident without further proof. And so he asserts that Jesus self-evidently speaks with the authority of God and therefore needs no further proof! *RRRrrriiiiggght** Here's another gem:  "Christ demonstrated that God and His word must be the self-authenticating, indisputable starting point for all thought when He, unlike Adam, refused to put the Lord to a test, rendering implicit obedience to God's authoritive law." (P. 63)  THIS GUY GOT A Ph.D IN PHILOSOPHY??? Specializing in epistemology???  Unbelievable!  Yet, there is at least one thing that is good about Bahnsen, he says the Bible says that the believer must always be humble and gentile in dealing with the unbeliever, and quotes 2 Tim 2:24-25:  "And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth"  The presuppers I've run into would do well to heed the advise of Bahsen 
 This play, mysteriously awarded prizes, must be the most conventional, boring work of the last decade. As at least one reviewer argues, there's nothing fresh here, nothing that transcends the hip soap-operatic. Margulies is the John Grisham or Robert Ludlum of playwrights. He should be writing TV dramas where the absence of philosophical subtext or depth is taken for granted. Only sentimentalists who swoon over problems in "relationships" could take this pabulem seriously. Apparently these days, this includes the Pulitzer Committee. It's good to remember, though, that this Committee, at least in drama awards, is overly fond of the safe and conventional. It prefers toothless works to anything with real bite. It rewards an empty work like "Three Tall Women" but scorns the unnerving "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" No doubt it will continue to reward the forthcoming effusions of the tame Donald Margulies 
 Book starts of with "Is this a Con?" like it's a hint of what's to come.  Childish stories about how the doctrines of the Worldwide Church were all wrong and suddenly needed to be changed. Maybe the recruitment tactics were not working anymore; or the false prophecies, scandals and financial ruin of its members had taken their toll on the organization. It was time to turn this thing 180' around, but what they did sunk the ship, and maybe that was their intent! Sure sounds like a conspiracy theory, and sure enough it seemed that way as the news of coming changes leaked out, only to confuse the once faithful. Why would ministers preach what they didn't believe? Well the money and benefits were pretty good. Strange how the sabbath changed along with unclean meats, holydays, tithing, healing, etc. Looks like Tkatch found the stairway to heaven, and Armstrong was no longer the infallible pope. Even the holy spirit changed into a person. And what the pagan trinity and the symbol of the cross became Kosher? The book mentions Herbert W Armstrong being the master salesman, and like a bar a soap he had to make his church unique so his followers would use no other. He started positioning his product by identifying all others as inferior or even worthless, as misleading, as spurious and even hurtful. Of course, he will have to use basically the same ingredients for his soap that they do in theirs, but will change the name of those ingredients. We were told that we were the "only true" soap. So when Tkatch and Co. began admitting  we weren't the only real soap out there, it all started to look so bogus. In their disillusionment many members started spinning off to splinter groups. Quite a few abandoned religion altogether and tried to live a normal life again. That was the real transformation as nauseating and heart breaking as you would ever experience. How could we have believed such things? By the means of Fear Induction Psychology and Mind Control by its leaders, this cult and its many divisions have manipulated the lives of its members and destroyed their lives. The book ends up bashing old Armstrong pretty well, but contradictorily says they are not judging him. Makes it worth the $1.09 the printed version is going for, but do a search and save the postage, unless you need the kindling.  For the survivors: "Does anyone remember laughter?" 
 I can't for the life of me understand why Rosetta Stone has garnered such good reviews (although I see a few negative ones here, so I feel validated) and seems to have such an outstanding reputation. I find it practically worthless, and it's expensive to boot. I'm sure that my experience with the German program would apply to Rosetta Stone's other languages as well, as they all taught via the same method.   I've been learning German for about 6 months and besides Rosetta Stone I have used Pimsleur, Rocket Languages, and have taken private instruction. Obviously, private instruction is best. But this review is about software, and Pimsleur is best. But Rosetta Stone has more bells & whistles, which is perhaps why people think it is so good. But it isn't. For example, nowhere in Rosetta Stone do you actually learn how to say useful things. Nowhere do you learn how to say "Hello," "How are you, "What's your name," or even "Where's the bathroom." Instead, you will learn how to recognize such useful phrases as "The woman and the boy have a ball on their heads" or "The man is under the donkey" or "These two fish are from the same species" or "The blue triangle is bigger than the red square." Ridiculous!! And note I said "learn how to recognize a phrase." This is the biggest weakness and disappointment with Rosetta Stone. It really doesn't get you to talk at ALL. You are not required to utter a word. You see four pictures, and the speaker will say (in German) "The boy is drinking milk." Now, if you have already heard the word for "boy" (Junge) and three of the pictures have no boys, you simply click on the picture with the boy and presto, you're correct! This multiple choice way of learning is not effective for learning a language! (There is a "practice speaking" mode, equally useless, which I mention below)   With Pimsleur, which is an audio only program, you hear conversations that will impart essential words and phrases. And they are repeated (and asks you to repeat) in such a fashion that it sticks. For example, it was weeks ago that it introduced "How much do I owe you?" yet I still remember it. (Wie viel shulde ich Ihnen?--No, I didn't cheat and look it up!) Pimsleur is brilliant in the way it gradually builds your knowledge and abilities. Of course, it isn't perfect as it doesn't explain the grammar. But neither does Rosetta Stone, and Rosetta Stone is worse because with Pimsleur there is also an English speaker who explains some things, while with Rosetta Stone you are left to twist in the wind. That's why software language learning programs should be seen as supplements--supplements to classroom or private instruction.   What are the bells & whistles on Rosetta Stone? You get to do a lesson in a variety of ways--seeing pictures with audio (the speaker), or pictures with audio and text, or audio only, for example. There is also a feature where the speaker on the program says a phrase, and you repeat it into a microphone and can compare your voice signature to the speaker's. But I found that this didn't work well at all and wasn't worth the trouble. And again, the phrases weren't useful 
 Very little plot, which is boring. The reader should be paid by the page, if not by the word, to read this book! 
 Having read six books on this exact subject in the past week, I feel information is poorly presented in this one.  Sometimes misleading, and sometimes even contradictory.    I highly suggest that you read other books and/or papers on the subject before braving this one.  Even then, take this read with a grain of agenda-salt 
 To anyone who knows the real history of the European part of WWII, this is an idiotic premise for a book.  In America--and nowhere else in the world--they teach that America, with help from the Soviets, defeated Nazi Germany.  This is propaganda  and makes us a laughingstock for our naivete.  In truth, while we were fighting the Japanese, and crushing their hopes beyond repair in the Battle of Midway, making it only a matter of how long it would take, not who would win, the Russians did the same thing to the Nazis in the Battle of Stalingrad and surrounding areas.  One huge difference is that while the U.S. lost between 292,000 and 400,000 dead in the entire war, the Russians lost beween 20 and 30 MILLION dead.  (Ponder that for awhile.  I find it incomprehensible.)  Unimaginable numbers of men, women and children died in and around Stalingrad, and the old beast Stalin--in perhaps the only completely truthful statement of his life--said, "They are not fighting for me and they are not fighting for Communism.  They are fighting for Mother Russia."  He was right.  When the 12-to-18 month battle was over, the Russians' fatalities far outnumbered those of the Nazis.  But the Russian people's courage--aided enormously by the climate that had doomed Napoleon, and supplies and food from the U.S.--destroyed a majority of Hitler's army.  The Nazis were in full retreat back through Eastern Europe, forcibly conscripting 15-year-old Poles to fight in what remained of their great army.  All of this was well BEFORE D-Day.  If you read American newspapers from November of 1943, you can read about conferences between FDR, Churchill (my pick for the greatest person of the century) and Stalin--discussing what they would do when the war ended.  In other words, they knew victory was a done deal--over half a year before D-Day.  So, this book is another effort to say the U.S. military played a major effort in defeating Nazi Germany.  That is a lie which every country in the rest of the world scorns us for believing.  In World War II, we did the following things:  (1)  Defeated a Japanese government & military not much better than Hitler's.  While we had help (as did the Russians in their immense sacrifice), we were clearly the main force in the Pacific, just as were the Russians in Europe;  (2)  Kept Stalin from metastasizing his way through the rest of Europe;  (3)  Hastened the war's end, a big deal.  Nobody will ever know how much longer Hitler needed to get the doomsday bomb, but we all know what he would have done, as those Russian tanks smashed their way through those final blocks toward his bunker, if he'd had the doomsday button at his command; and   (4)  Lost the lives of 292,000-400,000 courageous souls, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of others who came home with what is now called Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (a major mental disorder) and/or serious physical injuries.  I am not disparaging any of those sacrifices, nor trivializing Items (1) through (3), nor (of course) our defeating Japan.  But this country REALLY has to get past the notion we beat the Nazis or co-beat them.   We didn't, any more than the Soviets co-beat Japan.  A year ago, I heard an idiot on ESPN tout some movie about D-Day, a movie which was to air that night on their parent network, ABC.  He referred to D-Day as, "The most important battle of World War Two."  There are a lot of places in Europe where one would not want to be heard making that statement, and only people "educated" about history in American schools could in good faith state such nonsense.  This book, sadly, will only carry on this tradition of ignorance through propaganda.  The conspiracy to kill Hitler had been in its formative stages well before D-Day, for the reason its major participants had already known Germany was hopelessly beaten.    Here is what all reasonable people can agree upon:  (A)  It is a great tragedy the bomb failed to do its job, for it would have saved many millions of lives; and  (B)  It is too bad Rommel, a man deeply respected by many American military leaders, went down with the ship, because I don't believe he would have failed again.  Moreover, he obviously knew Stalingrad had destroyed the great Nazi machine, and that the combined wraths of the Russians/Soviets over Stalingrad, and the British over The Blitz in 1940-1941, would take a horrible toll on the Germans at the hands of their victors.  And he was sure right.    Americans nowadays argue over the morality of Truman's two atom bombs, with the vast majority of those who were not alive then condemning him for ordering the bombings.    I agree they are a fascinating subject for debate.  But I can tell you this:  I was born in 1953 and have asked well over 1,000 people in my life who were at least 21 on the date of Pearl Harbor how they felt about the dropping of those two bombs.  And I have NEVER found such a person who disagreed with the dropping of those atom bombs AT THE TIME, though many disagree with it now or disagreed with it later.  Not a single one disagreed with it in 1945.    But the firebombing of Dresden?  Not only does everyone I know now who knows about it condemn it as a clearly indefensible thing (which killed more people outright than either of those atom bombs), but most people I have known who were adults during World War II condemned it, too--not only to me, but when it happened way back then, finding no justification for it at whatsoever.  I apologize for using a monolithic subject with which to grade this book.  But it IS another book which perpetuates the lie that our military defeated or co-defeated the Nazis.  And our country's perpetuation of that myth/propaganda has done our country and its civilians a great disservice in the court of Western Culture's opinion.    I care a lot about that court's opinion of me and my country.  I don't care at all what Bin Laden and other fundamentalist Islamics think about me or my culture, any more than I care what Falwell and Robertson think about me.  But I am tired of having the rest of the Western World view Americans as naive idiots.    A book which perpetuates the notion our military defeated the Nazis will only help ensure that we continue to be seen--not only by Russians, but by all Europeans--as at least naive, if not idiots.

 Walter Mosley, like too many mainstream and mystery writers, appears to believe that "science fiction" means "logic and plausibility get tossed out the window." That the official Amazon.com review compares this book to the work of Philip K. Dick is amazing and wrong-headed; Dick knew how to ground his surrealism in the real world and especially in real human beings. Whatever Mr. Mosley does in his mysteries and mainstream fiction, that's not what he's doing here 
 I got this as a gift and if it wasn't alreay opened, I would have returned it. Theres nothing new or novel about the humor in the series. Its the same old tired race jokes throughout 
 This is a poorly written book on the important subject of race in politics.  Carter spends the entire book blaming conservatives' exploitation of race for their recent resurgence.  In many examples, he is  outright wrong(such as his analysis of the Willie Horton debacle), and in  others he dramatically overstates the significance of the particular  action.  The only credible observation is that of the evolution of a new  form of politics, a political system in which "image is  everything".  However, Carter complete ignores liberal manipulation of  race in politics, and this book subsequently comes off as being very  biased.  If you're looking for a good book on race in politics, I suggest  reading The End of Racism by Dinesh D'Souza or Hating Whitey by David  Horowitz 
 I bought this Hummingbird Flosser kit thinking that it could do the same work that my tired and circulation restricted fingers do.  It failed in getting between even my not-so-tightly spaced teeth.  I guess I'll stick with Oral B Ultra Floss since it works.  If your teeth are very tight/close together, I would suggest that you not buy the Hummingbird flosser 
 I bought the happy co electric head tripper for my husband for Christmas. He has wanted ones that we've seen in the mall, so this seem to be a good one.  Well, the plastic pieces that fit into the slot were very flemsy. We had to be careful not to snap it trying to get it in. Once we got it in, the head tripper felt great.  It really did send goosebumps down my spine.  THe only problem is the purple plastic piece broke off, litterally the next day after giving it to him. It first was bent and then finally broke all the way off. I do not recommend this product. I was thinking of getting the ting ting motorized head massager to replace them. You can still use the happy head tripper it is just one tong short 
 I just bought this book "the soft cover edition" after reading all these wonderful comments on the book. I thought, wow 9.95 and stats will be mine! I suppose I did not do enough research, because when the "soft cover" edition arrived it was not the same book that showed up in "Look Inside"... In fact, it's the outline study-guide for the text. I was really upset and feel that I have been misled. I am now returning the "soft cover" edition at my own expense because amazon "is not at fault". Please be aware that the reviews that are associated with this book are for the TEXT which costs alot more. I would have been happy to buy the text but I feel that I was misinformed and I am very upset. Don't make the same mistake I did. Make sure you buy the HARD COVER, unless you really want a useless "companion to the text" soft cover 
 "The Church" is nonsensical rubbish.  I know Dario Argento is weak on plot, but this movie is absurd.  It's interesting how Argento does such a good job with a movie like "Suspiria" creating such an effective atmosphere for a horror movie even though the plot is a bit shaky; but, with "The Church", the creepy atmosphere is clearly not present, and the acting and execution of the screenplay are so bad which only magnifies how terrible the plot is...the result is a disaster!!  Indeed, there is zero character development, horrendous acting, monstrous plot holes and an uneven screenplay, all of which lead to this piece of rubbish called "The Church".  This movie is trash...PERIOD!  STAY AWAY!!!! 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, Zola Levitt, Thomas McCall, John Hagee, Grant Jeffrey, Marlin Maddox, Perry Stone, Texe Marrs, John Walvoord (deceased), etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's site for details on these items, which are also available via Amazon) 
 Let me cite just one example from The Truth Behind Left Behind that makes it a very weak defense of the Left Behind theology. There are many more, but there are space limitations. In Tim LaHaye's Introduction to TBLB, we read: "Jerry [Jenkins] and I have unashamedly taken the position that all prophecy should be interpreted literally whenever possible. We have been guided throughout by the golden rule of interpretation: When the plain sense of Scripture makes common sense, seek no other sense. Take every word at its primary, literal meaning unless the facts of the immediate context clearly indicate otherwise" (7). So shouldn't the reader interpret the weapons of Ezekiel 38-39--bows, arrows, shields, war clubs, spears, horses, and chariots--literally? Not according to our authors. Here's their interpretation from their chapter "The Coming Russian/Islamic Invasion": "Inspired by the Holy Spirit, Ezekiel spoke in language that the people of his day could understand. If he had spoken of MIG-29s, laser-fired missiles, tanks, and assault rifles, this text would have been nonsensical to everyone until the twentieth century" (47). Of course, this is question begging in the extreme. Why would the people in Ezekiel's day need to understand a prophecy if it wasn't meant for them? Why confuse them and us? How do Hitchcock, Ice, and LaHaye KNOW that this is what the Holy Spirit meant? Once the trio makes these ancient weapons of no consequence, they are free to create their own prophetic scenario that can't be tested because it all takes place after Christians are no longer here! Convenient. Consider their words: "The focus clearly is NOT the specific weapons that will be used by these invaders" (47). What happened to "literal interpretation"? The weapons may not be the passage's "focus," but they can't be dismissed as inconsequential to the narrative. The weapons are part of the story from beginning to end, and if taken literally would negate the future scenario outlined by the authors. They claim that Ezek. 38-39 has to be a DISTANT future battle because it takes place in the "latter years" (38:8) and the "last days" (38:16). Most biblical scholars, even some dispensationalists, would say that these two time expressions most often mean nothing more than "in the future" or "in the days to come." The same Hebrew phrase is translated as "the days to come" in Num. 24:14, which probably refers to David's victory over Moab. The prophecy of Deut. 31:29, where the same expression is used, came to pass in the period of the Judges (cf. 2:20-21). Here's how one Bible expositor explains it: "this expression does not refer to 'the latter days' (KJV, RSV) in the eschatological sense. . . , but rather to that portion of the future that falls within the scope of the speaker's perspective (cf. Gen. 49:1)." Then one has to wonder why the authors avoid interacting with Edwin M. Yamauchi's Foes of the Northern Frontier which refutes their historical, geographical, and lexographic arguments line by line, and it was written in 1982! Yamauchi is a noted expert on this subject. The Russian invasion premise is only one of the book's many problems. If readers are interested in this topic, I suggest that they pick up a copy of End Times Fiction: A Biblical Consideration of the Left Behind Theology written by me. Since Hitchcock and Ice refer to it several times, it would be helpful to read what they do not deal with 
 I bought this software primarily so I could create slideshows with music and other special effects. Since I got it, I have had nothing but problems. First of all, it would not install completely on my computer. The techs at Adobe could not figure out the problem. After I reformatted my hard drive, I finally got Photoshop to install properly. Then another problem. When I burned my slideshow photos to a VCD, they came out just awful (unlike Adobe's demo video showing a perfectly created  slideshow.) Boy, was I deceived!   I cannot say that this software is all bad. It does a nice job in correcting exposure errors in digital photos. However, if you want to create neat slideshows, Photoshop Elements 4.0 is not worth the cost 
 The film starts out with a brilliant, and creepy premise -- what if there was a chemical that could be added to ordinary water, colorless, tasteless and odorless, that, when drunk, didn't just kill its drinker but turned that person's body into a deadly explosive?  As the movie initially unfolds, this premise is handled well and is remarkably chilling.  Pierce Brosnan plays the munitions expert who is in charge of determining the cause of several inexplicable explosions that have been taking out prominent senators.  His investigations put him in uncomfortably close proximity with one of the senators who may be the next target -- the man his ex-wife left him for following the death of their daughter.  As his investigation leads him to the bizarre method being used to kill off these lawmakers, he finds that his attempts to protect them are being misinterpreted and miscast, damaging his reputation... until he manages to prevent what would have been a deadly attack during a public rally.  Unfortunately, it's right after this attack that the film unravels into a mess.  Up until this point it was a tight, chilling mystery; the attacks unfolded with spooky "it could happen anywhere" finesse, the chemistry used in the film to explain the explosive compound was handled remarkably well, and the haunted past driving the protagonist (his daughter's accidental drowning and the way his life and marriage fell apart in the aftermath) was a nice subplot that helped but wasn't overbearing.  But at this point the film abruptly changes course and becomes a cliche'd 80s actioner.  His wife, witnessing his act of heroism, has the epiphany that she's with the wrong guy and comes back to him for a heapin' helping of "hot" 80s-style music-video simulated-sex.  Now the senator is the one on the outs, and gee, turns out he's dirty and probably deserves to get blown up, but our hero is still sworn to protect him.  The man out to get him, who up until now has been using remarkable finesse (and who wouldn't be creeped out by the concept that any glass of water could be their last?) suddenly switches over to much cruder tactics.  You could swap in virtually any action movie with a rugged loner hero, unscrupulous ass who has to be protected, glowering villain, and useless woman screaming encouragement on the sidelines, at this point, to the same effect.  Our hero, of course, saves the day, solves the crime, and wins the girl.  Live Wire had the potential to be brilliant, and would have been, but the final act ruins the entire puzzle-box effect of the film.  It's a shame, because it could have been a great thriller.  But it's not.  My recommendation: rent, don't buy.  Watch up until the end of the rally sequence, when the ex-wife gets that speculative, "we're going to have SO much sex!" gleam in her eye, and then hit the stop button, and imagine the ending yourself.  You'll get a much better film out of it that way 
 I was not impressed with the lack of real information. I could have gotten more information by talking to a "working model" for 10 min. The fact that Wilhelmina has been a part of soo many modeling scams, makes me think that this "advice" is off base too. All fluff , and no substance 
 I've seen better books that offer help in this area, but for the price I paid, it was still worth it.  My kids can use it to gain some insight.  It is very easy reading, too 
 The cover is very pretty thanks to Penguin books.  BUT..  this translation is seriously lacking in elegance.  Trust me.  Look into buying Robert Fitzgerald's tranlation or my personal favorite -Samuel Butler's tranlation.  They are far more poetic and descriptive than Robert Fagle.  I recommend picking up two translations and comparing the same few pages from the same chapters.  I honestly don't know why Robert Fagle got such high praise for this.  Take my advice and get Samuel Butler or Robert Fitzgerald's translation.   
 i purchased a 2 1/2 qt WMF pressure cooker. from the beginning the valve that closes by means of the steam pressure lifting a 'ball-bearing' to close a hole in a rubber safety plug sometimes closed, sometimes did not. once when it did not i was out of the room: burned pot; burned contents; fire alarms; smoky smell in house for weeks. when i finally found the office of the company and described what had happened i was told how great their engineers were and how many of their products had been sold world-wide for many years. in effect, i was probably lying, but i could return the pot for their inspection. i did. ultimately WMF replaced it [while i was shopping for a reliable product manufactured by someone else]. the guage on the replacement is now stuck open, making it unuseable. i still haven't been able to find the direct address of the manufacturer to ask for my money back [although i suppose the probability of receiving 3 lemons are in my favor]. my advice: stay away from WMF's poorly manufactured product and insulting response to complaints 
 These cables are usually aftermarket and made somewhere in Asia. With that being said the quality control can be poor and there is no guarantee that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped. The software being aftermarket too, has glitches if it even works with yoyr phone. Despite what the descriptions say, this software and cable are not compatable with Mac at this time 
 This book has one idea -- feed from a data base -- and he beats it to death.  It is not really helpful beyond the data base idea 
 Periodically throughout Eric Clapton's solo career, his music mellows out to such an extent that it barely resembles rock 'n' roll.  His self-titled debut got his solo career off to an unimpressive start, and his most recent offering, "Reptile," makes adult contemporary sound exciting.  A similar weak period occurred in the late 1970s through the early 1980s, with "Backless," "Another Ticket," and "Money & Cigarrettes" all competing for title of Clapton's Most Forgetable Album.  The country is mellow, the blues are mellow, and even the rockers are mellow.  This is easy listening for classic rock fans 
 I don't want to come out and say that this book is entirely useless, as I feel that would be unfair.  If you do wish to read something of the famous "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" series, I recommend you read the original and stop at that.  He has a lot of good advice, but tends to repeat a lot of the information throughout his different books.  His investment strategies are a little misleading, and probably should not be attempted by anyone who has only the experience of reading these books.  I liked his approach of "not cutting up your credit cards," but found his solutions somewhat misleading and uninformative.  His writing reminds me an awful lot of the get rich quick pep rallies made famous by late night television and Amway 
 Wow, another buncha poetry school dropout pouting girls clutching "banjers" and "gitars" wearing old dresses and ripping off Appalachian and southern culture while the ripping off is good. Tune in next year and the BGTs will be putting out a Calypso record. Another one for the "No Depression" poop pile 
 man i wish they would make the round house for dvd , now that was the show right there that tought me everything i needed to know growing up 
 Well, as a Brit, his focusing principally on events in Europe is understandable, yet one cannot help but wonder - why  did his "Age of Revolution" begin in 1789 instead of 1776? Surely the American Revolution, over the long run, has proven to be the most influential in world affairs, yet this prominent historian apparently didn't think it warranted any significant discussion. This seems rather odd. Perhaps his Marxist ideology has blinded him to the possibility that a nation could be founded on entirely different ideals, and be far more successful as a result. After all, Marx only promised his workers a "Dictatorship of the Proletariat" which was, when all was said and done, still a dictatorship (witness the USSR or, for that matter, Castro's Cuba). In contrast, the American Founding Fathers forged a nation based on much higher ideals, namely, the right of each individual to "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness". It would seem that this fact is worthy of a bit more memtion in what is supposed to be a thorough examination of the effects of revolutions in the late 18th through mid 19th centuries 
 These 'cartridges' sell for about $2 a piece, plus shipping. I recently switched from the Mach 3 Turbo to a Merkur Double Edge Safety Razor and I can safely say I will never go back. The Mach 3 provides a decent enough shave (much better than an electric, in my experience) but the single blade is actually much smoother. I pay about 50 cents a blade now with the safety razor - each blade lasts a little over a week - versus the Mach 3 at $1.50-$2.00 lasting 6 or 7 days

 I have been reading a series of autobiographical accounts of modern day warriors and had high hopes for this title.  As others have pointed out, Coughlin's ego can be suffocating at times.  This could be forgiven if it were the books only flaw.  Alas it is not.  The writing is amateurish at best and the author's overuse of adjective and hyperbole is very distracting.  The language is disjointed and unnatural as if it were written with the heavy use of a thesaurus.  Again this could be forgiven as we're reading this book for a soldier's account, not that of an English grad student.  This book offers a stark contrast in comparison with Nathaniel Fick's "One Bullet Away."  Whereas Fick seems to be an intelligent, thoughtful and humble warrior whose primary concern is the welfare of his men, Coughlin conveys himself as a shallow intellect with more concern for personal glory and satisfaction than anything else.  He is a team player when he hand picks the team and considers them worthy of his own company.  You cannot know a person from reading their writing but Coughlin's character development is very superficial.  His attempts to convey a "human side" are unbelievable and seem grossly contrived.  This is a great contrast to the character development in "One Bullet."  There is no connection between author and reader in "Shooter."  Coughlin does not develop the role players either.  In "One Bullet" you really feel the brotherhood developed among the officer, his NCOs and the enlisted men.  Additionally, Coughlin's demeaning descriptions of his support staff (non-trigger pullers) is tedious and only reinforces doubts about his team ethic.  To make matters worse the action isn't as well developed as in other titles.  The author's self-congratulatory tone and emphasis on personal exploits, with plenty of after-action chest thumping, obscures the view of battle.  He spends little time on the finer elements of sniper tradecraft, training and shooting.  This can be found elsewhere.  Overall this book was a great disappointment.  If only a fraction of Coughlin's self-acclaimed exploits are true, then he is a remarkable sniper.  He should let his accomplishments speak for themselves and not try to beat us over the head with them 
 The author spends so much time trying to be "precious" and "clever" that his narrative is confusing. Where am I? In England? America? Who am I reading about? Huh? Going back a few pages didn't help.  A total disappointment 
 I got this as a gift for my 18 month old son. It only produces one lousy bubble with each pull of the handle, very sad. My son got very frustrated and so did I. I would not recommend this product. 
 I had to purchase this book for an economics course. It does have some good examples and applications, but other times the book just bogs down and is impossible to read. Lastly, the price tag is ridiculious... Teachers, don't make your students waste their money on this 
 This book is so bad I almost didn't finish it.  The story is juvenile, as are the heroine and her boy friend (at least they have an excuse -- they are teen agers).  They're on the run, skipping from planet to planet, but the bad guys always seem to know where they are.  Hmmm.  Boyfriend is the son of a supporter of the deposed regime.  Mom sends him off with a backpack and tells him to help our heroine.  Do you think mom might have planted some sort of locator on son and is using him (without his knowledge) to track our girl?  The girl's "uncle" is by far the most interesting character - and he's left behind at the end of this book.  I will read the reviews of book 2 in this series before I spend any money on it 
 Harv keeps saying how great the book is going to be, and I was stupid enough to keep reading all the way to the end....and found out there was nothing.  Just a worthless rant 
 This book was required reading for a class on children's literature.  So, naturally, I was expecting the very best samplings of what was out there.  The beginning was quite exceptional.  I even invited my husband to read it with me since we share good finds to read together in the evening.  We were about 75% of the way through before its magic halted and it turned to various detailed descriptions of the main character's female body parts.  Due to this we feel it falls short as an example of wholesome children's literature.  We set the book down and did not finish it.  If you are looking for good children's literature that COMPLETELY steers clear of naked images instead of turning to them to keep the pace of the book going, then this book will be a let down.  Sad, because up until that point, the writing was quite good.  
 Warning spoilers...  In the worst installment of a bad series, Fitzchivalry wont die.  Perhaps the most interesting plot point of this whole contrived series is wasted entirely.  Fitz, who died, and rose again has his potentially interesting ordeal descrobed in perhaps the most boring way possible.  I supposed his dead body was infused with both wolf personality and human for a while (I guess souls mix when they are contained in a tiny brain), and of course the seizures.  Seizures trouble Fitz for a while, as long as they are convenient to the plot, and then, of course, they totally vanish.  While I found it really interesting that Fitz used to be dead, and the ramifications of that, we find that there are no ramifications whatsoever, except for a brief period of eliminate-the-wolf-behavior rehab.  I mean, he was reanimated after a period of time, but that's no big deal I guess.  Robin Hobb is such a good story teller, but she is horrible at plot.  Except in the Liveship traders series, but she must have written that one entirely differently, because you can't tell that this is the same author.  What she is good at is writing loveable characters, and slowly feeding you tidbits of knowledge about interesting things as the characters "learn" about them.  In other words she can "feed the fire" of the story well to keep interest.    But that doesn't mean she does it consistently, and this book is a great example of how even Hobb can utterly fail.  Robin relys solely on you LOVING the characters (which I feel she herself does) and she allows that to distract you from reasonable pacing.  This book starts out slow, then begins the ending phase of the master plot, and slowly slowly slowly panders through that and then ends in a rush.  Not to mention the fact that she knows nothing about plausibility.  This whole series is based on a character that is as loveable as your little brother, yet supposedly kills without compunction.  You know, an assassin.    This series asks people a simple question.  How would you describe an assassin?  Prior to reading this series you might say ruthless, cold, cruel, at best disaffected and callous.  Crafty certainly.  After reading this book, you would say, kind, affectionate, and loves dogs?  Add to that loyal to himself first, good natured, well liked, and an advisor to royalty?  So is Robin Hobb rethinking the role of an assassin?  No, you can't do that.  An assassin is an assassin.  You can't change that FACT.  No, she's creating a hero who was trained as an assassin, but who only functions as an assassin very very very few times at all, since that is a nasty business.  As kind and good natured as Fitz is, he never once questions the morality of killing someone because he was told in the weighty manner such a question deserves.  He never is actually put to any test.  So, Robin creates a hero, calls him an assassin, and swings the plot around to have him doing everying imaginable EXCEPT functioning as a cold-hearted killer.  He's a spy, a soldier, a telepathy partner, a wolf-buddy, and for some reason everyone just thinks he ought to be the hero.  When everything comes together, everyone just says Fitz, be the hero.  For no good reason at all (because you have telepathy does that make you the guy to go to?).  [...] Perhaps Robin thought the weirdness of the ending scenes would add a sort of tension, and of course, they were being persued, and so I guess that added drama.  But of course, the main threat, the "forged ones" were not really a threat anymore, but of course, you still have to resolve that issue, and was neatly done in the end.  But I felt the whole story, the drama of the "forged ones" really wasn't so dramatic, and I just don't get what caused them to behave just like they did.  On a fantasy scale, it was new, but not very interesting.  Robin does much better with dragons in the Liveship traders, and these dragons are just stupid.  And Verity-as-dragon is perhaps the dumbest of all.  Over all a slow build up for an overall letdown.  If I began Robin Hobb with this series, I would have never read her again.  I am forcing myself to finish the Tawny man series now, because I WANT to like her stuff.  But I don't know if I will EVER find enough time to finish that sleeper series.  Overall, try Ship of Magic, unless you are already invested in this, and have to have closure 
 I was very disappointed with the ending of this new Danielle Steel.  It seemed like a very long read, with a very quick ending.  I have read every one of her books, and have never been so disappointed with a story until now.  I would not recommend this to anyone 
 This book is proof positive that you don't have to have any talent to write a book and get it published. Ms. Tucker is not even aware of how to write a narrative, instead formatting her book like a script or a play. I find it even more amazing that people are actually buying it 
 This movie was boring, confusing and seemed pointless.  After her boyfriend is shot and killed in a convenience store, Courtney Cox goes through a difficult adjustment which includes a blur of reality and fantasy. We see her remembering the incident several different ways. Now, reading this description it would sound like the movie is intriguing and would be interesting but it isn't. With a premise that has potential the writer and director manage to create a dark, confusing and (worst of all) completely uninteresting movie. I was amazed that it was under 80 minutes because it seemed soooo much longer. I felt no connection with any of the characters, and found Courtney Cox's character the least engaging of all. The characters seemed two dimensional and the plot (if you can call it that) was pointless. By the end I just didn't care what really happened. Skip this one 
 If you've ever seen the great movie (Thirteenth Warrior) that was based on this book, "Eaters of the Dead" will just not measure up. Maybe the structure of the book was the problem. Crichton wrote it in the style of an medieval manuscript to try to convey the authenticity of an actual 1000 year old document. Maybe he was too successful with that conceit. It was usually the aim of medieval chroniclers to present the dry facts of an event rather than to strive for dramatic tension, character development or an elevated literary style. Unfortunately, those qualities are necessary in a novel.  This was mostly a bore. Don't bother 
 If you want to understand something about movies, read the classic texts on which some of the great directors formed themselves: Ejzenstein, Pudovkin, Bazin, Arnheim and stick to them. In this book which I couldn't read but for a third, you find essays on many aspects of film viewing and making which, in the best of cases, any film fan already grabs intuitively, without so much wordage being spent on them; others that are just an endless exercise in rehashing liminar theories set forth by other obscure "students" for the twenty people who care to read them; others try to reach conclusions on themes which are just waiting for some other academic theorist to reformulate them and that, being generally based on psychoanalisis, are generally undemonstrable. 
 The Contortionist's Handbook, Craig Clevenger's first novel, is a weird, complicated, seemingly pointless exercise in futility.  The novel follows John Dolan, who is known by many other names throughout the book, because that is what he does, he changes his identity, and others, with great expertise and perfection.  We are introduced to John when he wakes up from a headache that he refers to as a "godsplitter" in a hospital, and he is forced to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to determine if he is suicidal or depressed.  From that point, the novel divides its time between the interview between John and the Evaluator and giving us John's life story, which is remarkably uninteresting for such a weird tale.  The thing that gets me about this book is that it seemingly has no point.  I guess one could say its point to be "anti-psychiatry," but forgive me for asking that the author also include somewhat of a plot to at least make the story interesting.  The only interesting and entertaining part of the novel is the interaction between John and the Evaluator.  But, for some reason, Clevenger decides that John's life story is more important, even though we are only given a brief, fleeting glimpse into a life that seems to be much more complicated than the author wanted to put into the novel.  Don't get me wrong, I am not complaining about the novel's length, because I don't think I would have finished it if it was longer than it already is.    I also read Clevenger's second novel, Dermaphoria, a while ago, and while I didn't really enjoy it, the novel at least had some semblance of a story that made it worth reading.  As this novel grew closer and closer to ending, I slowly realized that there was no way that any meaning was going to be given to the convoluted story within the last 20 pages.  Clevenger tries to inject some suspense into the story near the end, but he ends up just using underdeveloped characters to do things that we have no idea what their motivation is for doing.  I think that Clevenger could be a good writer, but, dear Lord, he needs to try writing a "normal" novel, until I read about one of his novels, and it isn't about a drugged out freak or a mentally unstable counterfeiter, I think that I am pretty much done giving his novels the benefit of the doubt 
 I used this book in my Philosophy 101 class a few semesters back. Having taken a lot of Philosophy in my private high school education, I was expecting to be re-introduced to Plato, Buber, Kierkegaard, and other dead geniuses. Instead, I get this book and I'm given about 30 or so short essays on various topics by mostly modern authors. "The Apology" is there, but few other classic essays are. This book would make for an interesting read for the already initiated, but it will be a terrible introduction to philosophy for those who are new with it 
 I had to read this book for school and i hated it. I thought it was really boring. There was not any action in the book. I would not recomend this book to anyone that I know 
 These big internet companies are so good at screwing their companies. Do you see how this scam works??? They sell "FRESH WHOLE RABBIT" but when I order it, there's no head or skin! Can you believe?!  Uh, excuse me, do you think a headless rabbit missing its entire skin is "WHOLE"???  This is totally misleading. I have contacted Amazon 3 times asking them to please send me the skin, feet, and head so I have the complete set and they have ignored me or sent me autoresponder emails that don't specifically address the missing head and so on.  What they do, I'm guessing, is then resell rabbit heads, rabbit feet, and bloody rabbit scalps on another part of this website, and it's all pure profit. What a CROCK 
 I am a long-time Austen fan-though not one of Stephanie Barron, whose footnotes I find endlessly annoying.  I found myself wanting to throw this novel away halfway through, when Hatty was being falsely accused of all that nonsense. Blah, blah, blah. I decided to persevere, and found it interesting, though as others remark, too, too Dickensian. But that ending!!!  WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?  What a let-down!  Ending up with Godwit? Pullease!  It certainly made Camber look even more an idealistic fool than before.  And that letter with the reference to Hatty dying young--why even include that?  We all would rather just have her drift away as part of that time period without being forced to contemplate mortality.  And why  that letter from the present anyway?  Takes away all the 18th Century, pre-Regency atmosphere.  Unnecessary and stoopid 
 As someone who enjoys popular science books, dabbles in complexity theory, and works in modeling and simulation, I was really looking forward to this book.  Unfortunately, it is not well structured and the author seems to be unable to decide whether he's writing about complexity or M&S.  Yes, they are intertwined, but there are several books that treat the subject of complexity very well.  What I was looking forward to here was a behind the scenes look at the experimental aparatus of complexity theory:  Modeling and Simulation.  Whether its due to lack of understanding of the art of M&S or an excessive love affair with complexity, the book comes off half-heartedly discussing both.  If you want to learn about complexity, read something by John Holland.  If you want to learn about M&S, read anything but this 
 I purchased the standard edition of X3 primarily for 3 reasons: 1) It claims to have the ability to convert pdf files into WP format, 2) It claims to be able to organize your e-mail files through the use of WP Mail well beyond the capabilities of Outlook Express, and 3) It claims enhanced use of WP for word processing.  What I found was a product that met only one out of three of its claims.  In baseball, batting .333 will put you into the Hall of Fame.  In business, fulfilling one of three claims will put you into bankruptcy!  While the pdf converter is a rather good tool, WP3 Mail is unstable (and this is from their tech support department).  It destabilizes your use of e-mail to the point of making it virtually unusable in terms of reliability.  I imported older e-mail from outlook express when I installed the WP X3 software, only to later find out that the system crashed regularly.  I could not get at my older imported e-mail, and could not find a practical way to reverse the importing back into outlook express.  What really irked me was that their tech support was worthless in rectifying the situation.  They merely responded by saying they were aware of the problem and "may" release a patch to help sometime in the future.  Ahhhhh!  As to the alleged improved "word processing power", I have experienced more bugs then appear in an Animal Planet Channel special on insects in the Amazon Jungle.  Unwanted page formating changes occur when I click my mouse on the page I had just finish reformatting. Undesired line spacing would appear on pages.  The list goes on, but who has the time to be more detailed.   Do yourself a favor and avoid the product.  If you need to upgrade, check out the latest version of MS Word, you will be far more satisfied I'm sure 
 I enjoyed Covey's 7-habits work, and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books. This is one of the most heavy handed, preachy books that I have encoutered. Give me a break! After vomiting, I threw it out. Save your money and try these instead:  Leadership Challenge 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership Good to Great First Break all the Rules 
 I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.    This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.  THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.  I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.  If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead 
 SPOKEN HERE: Travels Among Endangered Languages is a poigant story of journeys on the theme of language diversity undertaken by Mark Abley. His survey includes the loss of indigenous languages in Australia and North America and the dwindling minority languages of Europe.  The loss, becoming ever faster, of the world's minority languages is a true tragedy, and Abley is to be commended for his effort. There are many fine points about his work. Unlike the average academic discussion of language diversity, he shows the reader some of the actual people whose lives are being affected by the loss of their ancestral languages. He shows that language death isn't limited merely to small disadvantaged tribes in the third world, but happens with us here in the West where Occitan, Breton, Welsh, etc. are facing challenges. I was especially happy that he dispels the myth--propagated by the artificial language's movement--that Esperanto exists to promote language diversity by quoting a statement by the iniciator himself, L.L. Zamenhof, that language diversity is bad and Esperanto was meant to destroy it.   However, so very much of SPOKEN HERE is objectionable. Abley is not a trained linguist, and he makes mistake after mistake that even the greenest student of linguistics would capture. For example, he dredges up the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, the now quaint notion that one's language shapes one's worldview. He makes blanket statements about how all the languages in the world are tending towards simplicity; it may be historically true for the Indo-European languages, but many other world languages, for example Mandarin Chinese, are developing more complex morphology. He also seems to think that some languages can be more "ancient" than others, for he writes that some languages were spoken in Australia when Sumer and Babylon were ascendent. Well, guess what, our language was spoken then too, but it was called Proto-Germanic and English is a natural continuation of it. Languages don't appear ex nihilo, so none can be more ancient than others.  Finally, while Abley might not present the old urban myth of Eskimo words for snow, but he gets close enough with his enthusiasm about other languages of people in the developing world. Now, no one is expected to know everything, and Abley could be forgiven for lacking formal training, but he discounts real linguists as just eggheads who use too many "big words" and apparently he had no trained person proofread the work before publication. In some places he insolently puts his own opinions above those of respected scholars, as in a passage where he writes "Chomsky may have made an important contribution, but I think...".  As a result of this plethora of urban myths, I cannot really recommend the book. If you are unsettled by the loss of the world's language diversity--and you should be--read LANGUAGE DEATH by David Crystal, a trained linguist who still can related to the average reader with a gentle tone and not too much specialized terminology 
 This book has major shortcomings; Stein's obsession with character over plot, for one (Martin Amis said, "I used to sneer at plot until I wrote a novel that had one, titled NIGHT TRAIN. It was HARD and I used stay awake at night hoping I wasn't leaving any holes."), another being his obsession with "show don't tell" (Gabriel Garcia Marquez's novel LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA is probably the greatest novel of the 1980's and it's almost entirely "tell" and very little "show.") And the passages Stein includes from his own novels as examples of good writing were actually examples of terrible writing! (A taxi "disengorging" its passengers is categorically bad writing.) And Stein admits he rejected Frederick Forythe's THE DAY OF THE JACKAL. I wouldn't read a book by Dick Rowe about how to make it in the music business (Rowe famously rejected the Beatles from Decca Records). Stein excuses himself that he was going by only an outline, but then Rowe was going by just a demo tape. Better writing books are out there 
 While this book contains some good information about the effects of stress on the body and the body's biochemical response to stress, it mixes this up with a lot of pseudoscience: telling you that you can control your cortisol levels by taking vitamin supplements, which will then solve all your health problems and make you slim! As another reviewer has pointed out, Shawn Talbott sells a slimming aid called Corti-Slim, containing mostly vitamins, which seems to have no science behind it's claims.  If you are looking for a book based on science and fact, I would recommend "The Stress of Life" by Hans Selye, or "Mind-Body Health and Stress Tolerance" by David Jameson instead of this one 
 I was hoping for a great collection of vintage and rare Mickey Mouse cartoons. That's not what I got.  Steam Boat Willy was shown with a large black boarder surrounding the cartoon.  I assume it was so the entire frame could be seen.  Cartoons two and three were complete rare sound films.  However the remaining cartoons were not original prints.  The openings were created electronically.  The cartoons were very enjoyable but don't expect a collection of all original prints.  
 I carefully read the instructions but could only get this thing to fly for more than 3-4 seconds. Once the toy is aprx 200 feet away from the controller, it shuts off or control is lost even after a full recharge of plane battery and with brand new set of fresh remote control AA bats. I gave it 8 tries in six different days and it is difficult to get it to fly or do things on the ground after a certain distance. very frustrating, do not bu 
 A rather cheeky attempt to rope a number of 20th century heroes into the postmodern progressive corral.  Each of them is quite beyond the academic tropes deployed here, though the writing does have a clunkily sensitive tone to it.  But academicese is no fit language with which to extol these people.  Stick with the general audience classics 
 This review will be simple: Garden State is fake, manipulative and annoying.  It tries way too hard, and every "idiosyncratic" element seems forced and insincere.  I hate to offened any reader out there, but the entire time I was watching this flick I had one re-occuring thought:  "This is a movie for Tools."  You know those big-budget, well-shot TV commercials for Cars or Cellphones? It's about two hours of that: Vapid and pretty, micro-managed and insincere.   The compulsive, overstated attention to detail is obnoxious and trite. The Director and cinematographer are more concerned with framing shots "well" than making a decent movie.  Skip this one!  Cliched, derivative, phoney, forced.  If you're in the mood for something in this 'genre' just rewatch your Wes Anderson collection or maybe 'I Heart Huckabees' or even 'Eternal Sunshine...". Don't waste your time on this drivel 
 I purchased these sheets as an additional set for a new mattress. The mattress probably measures 16" in depth. The first time the sheets were put on the bed, they slightly pulled from the centers, i.e. the fitted sheet really just does not fit and snug very well. After washing, the fit continued to get worse. However, it has never pulled from the mattress around its corners. The original set of sheets that I had on my bed were 500TC (from a different manufacturer), and I was so happy with those that I couldn't wait to receive these new ones. Unfortunately, these 600 TC sheets are no where near as soft as my 500 TC ones, nor are they as soft as some 400 TC ones I purchased thereafter. Overall they are a set of sheets purchased at a very affordable price, but if I had to do it again, I think I'd of been happier not getting these and paying double the price of these for an addition 500 TC set 
 The story is rather shallow and not intruiging at all. Although I`m very interested in medieval mystery storys I found this one particularly boring.  There is no ambiente in this story, I never felt anything or smelled what  it would be like to be in Wales in the 12th century. Much worse are the  charakters. They are very poorly made and mere onedimensional. Also, like  in an early Western one is to tell good from bad in a second. The good (or  noble) people are blonde, tall, muscular, intelligent, blue-eyed and strong  willed. The bad ones are dark, small, fat or skinny, dumb and dark-eyed.  This, pardon me if it is not so, looks to me (a concerned Austrian)like  Nazi- ideology and some kind of Übermensch- fantasy. It reminds me of the  ideal Aryan: blonde, blue-eyed, tall and muscular. That is a subliminial  message I couldn`t stand. Stay with Paul Harding (P.C.Doherty) or C.L.Grace  instead for fun and charakters 
 I love this band and have all the rest of their cds 
 In all this hype and whining over Williams, we forget that he was executed for a reason!  Why do we remember the life of this brutal killer who founded a gang that is still killing people to this day, yet probably noone reading this can name the innocent people he killed.  The fact that Tookie Williams simultaneous inconsistent claims of innocene and redemption were even considered is a sad commentary on American culture.  My sympathies lie with the people who deserve it; his victims.  Their names were Albert Owens, Yen Il Yang, Tsai Shai, and Ye Chin Lin.  Remember that out of everyone in this mess, Tookie was the only one with a choice.  As for those dumb dummies who think he's innocent, he had 24 years of appeals after he was convicted by a Jury of his peers( there was a black man on that jury and a Latino man so no crying racism).  Hopefully his execution proved that we value human life in this country so much that the only appropriate punishment for the most brutal murderers is that they pay with their lives.  
 I returned the book. Cumbersome. Not what I expected after a promo on TV had gotten me interested. Signed up and doing Jazzercise instead 
 This book is written by Hellen Keller, a blind and deaf woman, telling about her childhood and growing up. The book is filled with anecdotes. Each one is about a page or two long and has no connection with the one before it or the following one. The date can vary from year to year without much warning. I would not recommend this book to young readers. I am 14 and became quite confused at times. I had to read this book for school. There were some very nice points in the book, though. If you are a Hellen Keller fan, I would highly recommend this book. It is full of many things in her life that you would not know if you only read a biography or just watched one of the movies made of her life 
 The book is divided into two parts the first identifies the causes and nature of 'toxic shame' and the other how to heal from it.  I found the first part quite convoluted and lacking clarity he repeats things alot and seems to have invented a new vocabulary which is not always well defined.   The book uses alot of material from other authors such as Alice Miller et al. which represent the best parts of this book. There is an originality from them which Bradshaw lacks, his input felt quite biased and perhaps that is why he rambles so much.  I have begun the second part but have found it lacking, it uses the 12 step program as the ideal model for healing and somehow just throws together disparate research on healing.   If this book represents his others I think it sad that he has made a career out of simply putting forward other people's work with little valuable contribution from himself.  I found his tone somewhat preacher like and I feel he hides behind ambiguity in his language and writing style to disguise the lack of substance.  THe book does have value but only becuase of the references to other people's work.   
 I give this 2 stars only for its historical information of Hitler himself.  Most of which you can get from anyother book. I thought that this book barely started to unfold the history of Geli and Hitler.  It's main focus  was on Hitler with what seemed to be a few side thoughts about a  realationship that was said to be the most meaningful in Hitler's life.  It  raised many questions and did not offer many answers.  There are a few  conflicts with previously written accounts of Hitler's sexual life.  This  relationship was surrounded by mystery and will continue to be surrounded  by mystery when you are done reading 
 I guess success turned around for Sam Raimi in 2002 & 2004 with the two Spider-Man films, but first he created this "V" like character in this garage of a movie, I liked "V for Vendetta" but not this "Darkman" if want to see a badly burned viligante in a mask see "V for Vendetta" don't see "Darkman 
 The book I received appears a very cheap copy of the original book. There is no ISBN and copyright page, even the cover appears a cheap colour photocopy. What's the story?? You pay $20 for a book you expect to get a quality printed book. It mentions that it is published by Harper Collins though I am unable to find any reference to it on their website. I believe Amazon and/or the author owe buyers an explanation 
 This was nothing more than an advertisement for a couple of ex-SEAL's who started a company. Obviously based on entry techniques, clearing, (etc...) it shows nothing interesting and was a complete waste of money. After the second disk I turned it off, and just gave it to someone. TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT! (for lack of a better printable word 
 This may be the first time you hear me say this, but Go Fish was too artistic and dated for my enjoyment.  I think that if I had seen this film when it was first released back in 1994 I would have been impressed.  This was a very avant-garde film that tried very hard to discuss an issue that was very "hush-hush" back in the early 90s.  Lesbians were very closeted back then and were not a major part of the culture norm as they are today (well, as much as we recognize them today).  This makes for a very provocative film, but it also makes for a very dated film.  This was my biggest issue with this film was that it nearly felt like a comedy instead of this symbolic struggle to pursue happiness like any heterosexual relationship.  I realize that director Rose Troche was trying to show us that a lesbian relationship is no different than a male and female relationship and even lesbians talk like men talk about women, but somehow it just felt very dated and clich for me.  It didn't open more doors in my mind to the lifestyle of lesbians, but instead gave me this dated image of this butch lesbian that is rebelling against something instead of embracing the true lifestyle.  The black and white photography, while symbolically trying to show the black and white of the situation and relationship, just felt like an art film.  This was an art film, so what am I griping about?  I guess I just didn't want to see an art film with this topic.  I wanted to see something along the lines of Kids or even a documentary, not something where the uneducated will laugh at and ridicule even harder.  I wanted a film that was going to punch me in the face, not build upon dated/old clichs that instead poked my mind randomly and not very hard.  It was unimpressive.  It wasn't bold filmmaking, but instead just this random, average production about a lesbian love story.  Was it to be educational?  I think there were elements that could have been explored greater and into detail to cross that education/lifestyle acceptance line.  The scene dealing with bisexuality is the first that comes to mind.  This probably sounded great on paper, but when it was actually filmed out, it seemed high schoolish and bland.  The inner voices were not struggling with the character, but instead causing confusion and chaos that will never be resolved.  Another scene that could have played out just a bit better was the dinner scene where a group of lesbians have gathered for a party.  There could have been more discussed between the lesbians like lifestyle, issues, and current problems (that would help with the dated feel) instead of just sex, sex, and more sex.  That was a huge downfall for me was the constant reminder that all these women wanted was to have sex.  There were times when I was watching this film where I felt a bit of sweetness in my mouth because I thought there was some candy-coating happening.  This does not need to happen in a film that is supposed to bring the lesbian lifestyle closer into the spotlight.  I never felt that these women in this film were given the best light to show their stuff anyway.  From the beginning of the first scene until the last (and all those snippets in-between) all they could talk about was sex.  They wanted to have sex more often than I honestly think about in a day.  It really made the rest of the non-existent themes seem blurry and unimportant.  There was just a consistent lack of togetherness for this film that ultimately hurt it in the long run.  This wasn't a film about women's rights, but instead a dire attempt to show the similarities between homosexual and heterosexual relationships.  I agree that this happened, but just not very coherently.  There seemed to be other elements strewn together in a very loose fashion that took away from the overall power of the film.  Don't get me wrong, this could have been a very powerful film about a lifestyle that this world is still not accepting, but instead it went too far to the left (which isn't bad, except in this case) and chose to go the bleeding artist route instead of the informative, here are the facts route.  The black and white photography, the lack of character development (who really was Ely's partner?), and the cheesy moments between scenes where women talked to me about the illusive "honey pot".  It just wasn't coming together well for me and eventually fell apart all together.  Overall, I was not impressed.  There are greater films out there that express the power of the relationship and do not create this unimpressive "raw" sensation by trying to shock the audiences.  One of my favorites is the film Big Eden which accepts homosexuality like it is commonplace in society.  If Go Fish would have been done in a similar style, I think I could have walked away from the film with a better taste in my mouth.  Instead, I am stuck with an unimpressive story that did nothing except joke about why lesbian women like to play the game "Go Fish".  Ha ha ha h....it just isn't working for me.  I do not recommend this film in the least bit.  There was one, singular scene that made me chuckle and for the likes of me I cannot remember why.  It was an unmemorable feast of bad cinema.  Skip it.  Grade: * out of **** 
 Cleary, no one ever taught Mr. Freehling to do research!  This is the most asinine book ever written about the "late unpleasantness."  First, the states of the Upper South were definately NOT Anti-Confederate!  Anyone who claims as much has lacked the historical studies to pass a history class, let alone have a book published which some will take seriously!  Lincoln arrested Secessionists in Maryland, which kept the state from seceding from the Union.  And, both Missouri and Kentucky joined the Confederacy late in 1861.  There are 13 stars on the Confederate flag, there were 13 Secessions, and 13 states of the Confederacy.  Missouri and Kentucky were, though, occupied throughout the war, with Kentucky being liberated briefly during the war.  This book lacks consistency, and perpetuates a biased and untrue history [someone should think of our children when they write this garbage].  If I had the capabilities of giving it no stars in a rating, I would enthusiastically do so.  Don't buy this book, look for another 
 I know that "Herland" receives quite a bit of praise and is highly regarded. In my opinion, the work doesn't bear up under these accolades. The story is down right boring, which is disappointing considering how engaging Gilman's short stories and other works are. The plot is odd and the message that Gilman is trying to convey is lost. I saw another reviewer call this work a satire, but I would strongly disagree. Gilman did not intend "Herland" to be a satire. She was attempting to show that women were more adept at "social housekeeping" than men were.  Unless you have to read it, there are many other and better Gilman pieces to absorb your attention with 
 This book was well written and entertaining until the end.  I gave him one star for knowing how to write.  Mr. Blankley told the story of the threat we face quite skillfully but in the end he dropped the ball and really didn't have any ground breaking suggestions or creative ideas as to how to avert the disasters that are sure to come.      Mr Blankley's ideas: Declare war on the terrorists, do some intense ethnic profiling, lock Muslims up in camps, make life more miserable for our enemy wherever and whenever we can and cross our fingers, pretty well sums it up.     Does he really think that making life tougher for the terrorists, who are used to considerable hardship (more than most of us would be able to tolerate) and willing to die for their cause, is going to stop or even just control them?    George W. Bush likes to pretend that the terrorists struck the first blow on 9/11, that the clock started ticking on that day  and we are now just busy retaliating.  Mr Blankley measures the start of the terrorist problem to an Egyptian cleric in the 1960's.  Folk's I don't want to burst anyones bubble here but America has been dickering around in the middle east ever since the first drop of oil was taken out of the ground there.  As soon as we figured we needed that oil the Arabs were in trouble.  We haven't been able to keep our hands off that region since.  Getting leaders deposed or killed, installing and/or supporting dictatorship governments, suppling weapons to one side and then sometimes to both sides, encouraging and supporting countries to fight surrogate wars for our benefit, bombing the crap out of them and then invading and occupying Muslim Holy Lands, and the list goes on and on from the start of the twentieth century through to the present day.  And anyone who thinks there is an end in site is hallucinating.  Forget about all this "The reason they hate us is because we support Isreal" nonsense, America had done more than enough before Arab land was given to the Jews to make enemies that will last for hundreds of years.    It is not lost on Muslims that we are willing to sacrifice as many of their lives as it takes to get what we want.  And what might that be?  Why of course, influence and control of the middle east and the oil it produces.  Some may think that we (Americans) are somehow entitled to do whatever it takes to people from other countries in order to maintain and improve our standard of living and that's all well and good but they must also realize that there will be consequences and a heavy price to pay.  All indications are that in the eye's of the terrorists 9/11 was just a down payment.     We have made an enemy out of people who are now fighting for their culture and their way of life.  People who see our way of life as a cancer to them.  People who live in a culture where grudges are held onto for thousands of years and some of them  are now willing to give up their lives to kill us.  Whether we think we are right or wrong that is the reality we face.  We are in deep trouble, Mr Blankley and you are going to have to come up with something better than just tightening the screws to impress or defeat this enemy.    
 Stick with Blitzkid because they can sing ten times better than this guy. He is also in Blitzkid actually and he plays drums...where he belongs. The songs on this cd are very well written and played, its just a shame that the singing is so forced and cheesy. I mean I know this is supposed to be 50's style doo-wop rock, but please. Better things in the genre....like Blitzkid 
 Title says it all - it simply does not work, yes it turns and trims a hair here and there, but I would not purchase this again.  I am happy with my other Wahl product 
 I have 3 major complaints about this book:  1. The author has abused his accidental access to Major Winters and often brags about his friendship and access to the Major and thus, particularly in the opening, attempts to make the book about him (the author) rather than about Major Winters. 2. This book is mainly regurgitation of material already in print. There is no or very little original research. Not only is it regurgitation, there are many lines that were blatantly plagarized from other sources, verbatim or nearly verbatim, and the author did not properly quote those other sources. 3. It is completely unforgivable for the author to completely skip over D-Day. It makes the work unacceptable and not credible 
 I checked this book out under the new section of the library, and found it to be just an awful read.  The whole nanny thing is becoming a bore, a re-tread topic, and Barbara Kline is no P.L. Travers.  Still, I don't know what was worse--the "exposure" of these women/couples who give birth and then turn their children over to surrogates to raise--or the reality that the nannies themselves are "maxed out."   The best part of the book was the Caitlin Flanagan quote (she's a fabulous writer) at the beginning.  I'm not surprised that Chris Matthews and wife allowed themselves to have their "nanny" situation included in this book 
 If you are tring to practice you Faux news allegiance I guess you'll enjoy this book.  If you looking for fair honest information don't waste your time 
 I should have known from the title that this book is Oscar Wilde meets the National Enquirer.  Here's the long and short of it: Oscar Wilde had a *LOT* of gay sex.  Does McKenna have delicious, juicy stories about it?  No.  Is there evidence to base this on?  Hey, the National Enquirer doesn't need footnotes, so why should McKenna?    This isn't history, and it isn't juicy dish.  Why bother? 
 i had to read this book for a class and i didn't enjoy a single word, sentence, paragraph or page.  sure, brown is great at setting up mood and tone, but the writing itself is so awful that 90% of the time i was wondering if it was intentionally bad--like so bad it's good.  there's nothing likeable about the characters.  the main character, whomever she is, is one of the most pathetic characters i've ever read. each of the short stories is an exercise in co-dependant lust. brown's narrator continually talks about a lost love, yet everything the narrator reveals proves it was nothing more than physical lust. it's hard to get behind a character who can't think, act, or depend for/on herself. the narrator is practically rendered immobile by this former lover.  and it's simply impossible to read. but perhaps i'm a bit unfair in that i didn't finish the book.  i suppose those individuals who gravitate towards this type of writing (and i realize i'm making gross generalizations here) are postmodern types who believe style is preferable to substance. and i suppose that's all well and good.  if you want literature that exposes the frailties of humankind, exposes our contradictions, and actually has something to say about humanity, avoid rebecca brown at all costs.  if you want literature full of flowery writing, postmodern psychobabble, trite adolescent sentimentality, and co-dependent characters, by all means, buy this book.  for example: in the story 'junk mail,' the narrator believes she finds codes and clues from an ex-lover in the mail. by the end of the story the narrator's on an island as a helicopter lowers her returned body parts. you gotta be kidding me.   after reading a handful of stories i wanted to hurt myself. badly.   i have nothing against rebecca brown as a person. i'm sure she's lovely.  but how this book got published is beyond me 
 My roommate's mouse broke (she had the older L shaped receiver)... and I thought it was because she's bad with technology. But I'm a computer junkie who knows how to take care of her technical equipment... and even mine broke (a few months later, I had a straight receiver). It just gave up on me. Not a battery issue. More like a connection issue.  Now I read all these reviews about it breaking on people. Well, I'll write back when my other roommate's break, and when my cousin's break.  Don't get me wrong... but it was great while it lasted. Less than half a year. Gonna go back to my Logitech. That never broke on me 
  I've spent all day putting together a 300 page book in Corel Draw, the file was saved several times without error, the finished piece is 2.6 GB. I exported it as a PDF that is 4.5 GB. Never any errors in Corel Draw.   Acrobat won't open the PDF. Says it's corrupted.  Now when I open the CDR all I get is a single page, and when I right click on the file and look at the properties it says it's 0 pages.  I'm really upset, and now I've wasted an entire day with COREL's software, if the thing is just for 1 or 2 page church brochures COREL should WARN people on the package.  It looks like I'm SOL and I'm guessing Corel will never bother with a reply.  Hint: I think I'll switch to Adobe.  Sincerely,  Waitman Gobbl 
 To include Jane Fonda in the same catagory or breath as Elenor Roosevelt or "Di" is a travesty and disgrace.  Jane has an over inflated ego, puts her "body" before brain power, and flaunts her anti-american beliefs in the face of all Americans.  Yet, through the mechanizations of the press, television, and powerful and influential people like you, she can get away with it...to some people.  Ever since the 1970's and Tom Hayden and the "peace-nik's" she has degraded this country, our veterans and our Honored Fallen.  She is NOT one of the great women, if I had to give her a catagory she would fall into the classification with: 1. Jane Fonda, 2. Lucricia Borgia, 3. Lizzy Borden, 4. Ma Barker, 5. and star in "Bonnie & Clyde.  Now, that is a class befiting her stature! No, I would not buy this book because of her.  I can read about the other WONDERFUL contributing (and tragic) ladies elsewhere.  Not my $$$. 
 I didn't read the passage that the other reviewer did, who stated:  "Did you know that if you start a business from your home, everything you currently own and use for the corporation (tables, computers, chairs, etc.) can be considered a donation to the corporation, resulting in a write off on your individual tax return? You can even write off your rent if you operate from there!"  But assuming his citation of the book is accurate the book is flat wrong.  A contribution by a shareholder to a corporation in a 26 USC 351 transaction is NOT A CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION and IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE by the contributing shareholder.  Moreover, one cannot contribute assets to a corporation in exchange for stock, and then cause the corporation to make a 26 USC 179 election with respect to the contributed assets.  Merely operating a business inside corporate solution is not a silver bullet for tax savings.  Nor, as some will claim, is forming a NV corporation 
 The CD was great and extra scenes on the Cd were really good, however it could have been advertised that it was the wide screen CD and I would have bought another! So I wasted $21.00 as I have a HD TV but not wide screen. 
 Rick Pitino's book on how to overachieve in the business world is nothing that anybody with any common sense hasn't heard before.  The book was written because Pitino is trying to tell his story of his basketball career.  He will make a germane point with the first paragraph at the beginning of the chapter, and then will belabor the simple point into 20 pages.  This is a good book to read, buy you don't need to read the whole thing, you need to read the first few points of the chapter, where Pitino makes his point, and the summary of the main points at the end of the chapter, and you will learn just as much as somebody who read the whole book.  It is a decent piece of literature, but combined with a biography of Pitino's career makes the entire work way to redundant 
 I am an avid Michael Crichton fan and have read pretty much everything he has written aside from his nonfiction books.  Crichton's writings are often full of action, complexity, character development, as well as a deeper underlying theme or message about society, technology, and human nature.  The Great Train Robbery was either lacking or painfully deficient of every one of these elements.  As I expressed in the title, it is written more as a historical documentation of an event rather than a traditional novel and is frequently interrupted by lengthy explanations of historical perspective.  The Victorian criminal slang used (although brilliantly) to tell the story makes it a slow, and at times, unintelligible read.  I give it two stars because it is obvious that Crichton has written a well thought out, well researched book; I only wish it didn't feel like I was reading his history report 
 This book was written ( I bet)by unpaid graduate assistants. I borrowed it from the library to read before mr Fukuyama's arrival to speak at a university. The book was "written to order" to appeal to American conservatives. If Mr Fukuyama had really wanted to write about the construction/maintenance/increasing/decreasing of TRUST he could not have pointedly ignored the European Union. Nations and peoples with a thousand or more years of organised warfare are now at peace and trying to work together now that's an exercise in TRUST BUILDING. I asked Mr Fukuyama why, as the book doesn't have America in the title, did he only mention distrust in medieval Italy and not the phenominal TRUST required to bring Germans, Brits and the French together. His reply "Oh .. people always want me to talk about their country. Next question." well!.... I feel that this book is a dis service to Americans because as with so many political/cultural and economic books from the USA what is left out of the book adds to the hurly burly spiral of disinformation accepted as the truth about the world by many Americans and esp. uncrital conservatives. I am, of course by my own reckoning, a conservative - a mixed economy democratic christian from the U.K.(OK OK New Labour) So I am not hostile to the US, but this type of book and the supportive reviews sadden me. Good luck America and PLEASE read wider and TRAVEL 
 Tompkins book is a good list of the works of those who have researched the pyramid themselves.  To make use of the varied and stimulating ideas he reiterates, it's necessary to go to his sources.  I'd advise starting with Smyth if you can put up with his religeous overtones.  Overall a light read, but well done 
 For what purpose these lies about the life of this man? Are the liberal film makers racists who don't believe that there is a good black man to depict on film so they have to lie? If someone wanted to write fiction about a badass black fighter on the cusp of super stardom who is framed for a murder then be my guest. Hurricane carter is not and was not that man.  Facts: In the movie denzel washington is shown in military garb with more medals on his cheat than colin powell. They want to drive home the point that here was a man who served his country and is now about to be screwed by it. Fact is carter was kicked out of the army after being court mashalled 4 times!  In a title fight scence with an italian american fighter named giodello carter is depictied as beating this man pillar to post only to be screwed out of the decision he so richly deserved. Fact, giardello deserved to win that fight according to the overwhelming number of experts who have viewed it then and now on tape. The depitction is another lie.  Another lie is this notion put forth in the movie that hurricane was on the verge of getting that title before mean white bigots framed him for this murder. Fact is that carter's boxing career was going down hill and he had only won 8 of his last 15 fights. As carter's boxing career failed he became more militant in his political views and hated white people. While in prison he was diagnosed to be psychotic. Yeah a psychotic racist is the model for black america. Shame.  Norman jewison must not think much of black folks to make a movie of lies like this. Denzel washington should be ashamed he participated in such trash. Those who produced this trash bet that the average public would be gullible enough to believe these lies with no attempt at knowing the truth and hollywood didn't care; they just like the message. Looking at these reviews i have to say they made a good bet. America bashing and race baiting is alive and well, earning oscars and making for big box office. A shame.       
 4 of "their songs" are covers of S Club 8 & S Club 7 songs, suprising that SC7 & SC8 are all from the same company!! 
 I have read and loved the books in Mrs. Gunn's "Glenbrooke" series, and I was hoping to find illustrations of the homes and gardens in fictional Glenbrooke, Oregon.  I was seeking the recipes mentioned, but not provided, in the Glenbrooke books.  I thought that the characters would be mentioned, or that their relationships might be elaborated upon...I was sadly disappointed.  This is a lovely gift book, filled with brief, warm reflections on the author's own special moments revolving around the tea ritual.  The illustrations are colorful and peaceful.  The recipes look well-devised and tempting, though, I must admit, I have not tried any.  This is a delightful book for people interested in "taking tea" with the author.  But, I am sad to say, the relationship this book has to the Glenbrooke series is tangential at best 
 I adore his series with Precious in No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency and purchased The Sunday Philosophy Club in high hopes.  I could not finish it.  I forced my way through half the book hoping it would get better - it didn't.  I finally realized after a month went by and I did not pick it up that I was just not going to finish it.  So I traded it in at a local used book store.  I just never grew to care about the main character and the plot did not progress.  The main character was just a monstrously bored busybody.  I did not see any justification for her actions throughout the book.  And the endless talks of ethical and philosophical dilemmas were grueling - I skimmed through them.    I have been telling everyone not to bother with this book.  It was very disappointing 
 This book does not have the quality that I am use to reading in her books.  If you want to read a really good one, read "The Harvestor" or "Freckles.&quot 
 I was disappointed with this book. He has his picture on every other page, literally. The numbering of chapters is confusing. I truely have gotten much more out of "Strong Women Stay Slim" by Miriam Nelson, which I got from the library, and now have purchased. I would suggest taking a look at Jorge's somewhere before making your purchase~ (do as I say, not as I do LOL) "Strong Women" just seemed so much simpler, and the drawings of the exercises are pleasant and clear. Often times I don't want to do the exercises, then I think "well, I'll just do the first one" and before I know it I've done them all and am feeling better. In fact, I have now ordered Nelson's book on arthritis. Note: There are only 6 basic exercises plus stretching in Nelson's work, so it certainly doesn't take much longer than Jorge's "8 Minutes. 
 This book was not what I'd hoped for - which is a solid introduction to Yixing teapots.  It concentrates on the history of Yixing teapots - and those that have been found in archaeological digs dating back to the Song Dynasty in China.  Many of these ancient pots are illustrated in the book. There is some discussion on the qualities that make Yixing clay different from most other types of clay, but there is also much missing.  The book doesn't illustrate examples of the differing colours available in the clay and never discusses famous clay types like Zhu Ni, which is so highly sought after by Yixing collectors.  There is a fairly large section on ancient masters of the art and those of the 19th and early 20th centuries. It's just a shame that their chops or signatures - which are usually recorded on their pots are not included in the text. Also missing is information on the modern state of the Yixing industry and the mechanical way modern pots are mostly made.  This is a rather basic and superficial look at Yixing pots and wares - but if you are after some biographical information on the most famous past masters or want to see illustrations on some very ancient Yixing pots then this book will be of interest to you. 
 These DVDs are "Laserlight" releases which mean that they have very poor quality picture and sound.Wait for the new Hitchcock Box sets which have clear picture and sound plus documentaries and other extras.The superb Criterion versions are also a good choice.If it's introduced by Tony Curtis,then it's Laserlight,avoid it 
 this is too funny Ohio exit polling must have been much like Illinois?  I voted Bush and afterwards was Swarmed by 3 thug looking "exit pollers" who looked angry when they asked me who I voted for   "Kerry" was my response... they happily jotted it down.  so much for the exit poll conspiracy.  please don't slice my tires !!!!  
 i can't figure out why this album was even released. i know fans have waited about 7 years for a new album from johnny since the 1997 live in new york. in that album johnny was already showing signs of serious health problems that have affected both his singing and his once powerful guitar playing, the span of the last 8 years have seen johnny in such a state that his voice is but a whisper and his guitar playing is very labored. the only reason for 2 stars is a good backup band and a solid choice of material.this album will be a painful downer for any fans of johnnys music and playin 
 Although it's stupid to compare these episodes of the twilight zone to the originals that inspired it, it's hard not to feel a little let down by the pay-off at the end of most of the stories on offer here, season one of this run had some what could be loosely described as 'Classic Episodes' and very much justified there existence plus season one had the ambition that season 2 and 3 are sadly lacking. Shorter and more rushed you could see that the poor writers and directors were working on a shoe string and ideas are never fully realised which is a shame because some of the ideas here could have been played out so much better none more so than in the very first episode on disc one ' The once and future King ' Where an elvis impersonator is transported back to before elvis cut his first demo. The premise is set up brilliantly but is let down at the pay off. other episodes of note 'shelter skelter', 'the Hellgramite method', 'curious case of edgar wetherspoon' show traces of genius and are well worth writing home about however the real 'classic' on offer here is ' the Cold Equations ' where real character and depth go hand in hand with just plain twisted sadness, it is brilliant if just a tad depressing. However the bad out weighs the good. The sign of a great tv series is if it bears repeated viewing and remains as sharp the second time around and with Mr Serlings originals you could more or less say that about 90% of them. These however, with the exception of the said episodes above, do not stand up so well. But still you need to buy it to finish the collection. 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 "Histoire de Marie et Julien" is the most solemn movie I have seen in years. It comes complete with heavy-handed symbolism, characters who are wallowing in existential anomie, and all manner of pretentious ambitions. But worst of all, it is devoid of any shred of humor or wit.   What remains? The "mystery" of the tale? Those viewers who find themselves still conscious at the end should have little trouble figuring it out. Rest assured that I take no pleasure in slagging this film; I'd just hate to see anyone waste their time and money on it. 
 As someone who is very interested in oil and it's effects on the global economy, I looked forward to reading this book with great interest.   The Leebs go through a cursory analysis of the state of the current oil supply.  The question of when we will reach peak oil production is open to great debate with estimates varying widely depending on who is asked.  The Leebs assume that we will arrive at our peak oil consumption in this decade and predict $100/barrel oil by 2010.    They may be right, they may be wrong.  I am not troubled by their prediction of $100 oil; however, their conclusion that $100+ oil will cause hyperinflation is stated as fact with no real evidence to substantiate their belief.  In fact, many economists will argue that rapidly increasing oil prices could be deflationary or only marginally inflationary.  The Leebs assume that the oil embargo of the 1970s and the resulting inflationary spiral that occurred in the U.S. will occurr again as oil prices march steadily higher.  This logic is flawed for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that a steady, measured rise in prices allows time for the global economy to adapt to higher oil prices in ways that a sudden oil shock does not.    Furthermore, some economists argue that higher oil prices could be deflationary.  The Leebs ignore the fact that we are living in a globalized and highly competitive environment that is very different from the world of the late 70s.  If companies are having greater difficulty passing along higher energy costs to consumers; profit margins will contract, investment in R&D and new manufacturing capacity will slow, job groth will stagnate, and deflation will be as great, if not more of a threat, than inflation.  When manufactures are able to pass higher energy prices to consumers, the higher costs will tend to suppress demand thereby limiting economic and wage growth.    Personally, I think they got it wrong.  The Leebs do not support their basic premise that higher oil prices will lead to inflation; they accept it as received wisdom.  For this reason, everything that flows from their assumption of hyperinflation is flawed.  
 of The Fast & The Furious movie and only 20% of the movie time contains racing, Simply the movie is an advertise for a Misfit car called 2005 GTO (a.k.a Holden Monaro desgined and produced in Australia) also released as 2003 Chevrolet Lumina SS Copue in the Middle East (I bought one before & sold it after one week only), This car simply not Pontiac or Chevrolet it's Holden and you can find alot of them in the streets because of it's cheap price as a sports car.  for more info. check: www.holden.com.au / www.chevroletarabia.co 
 I was very disappointed in the condition of the book.  The book worked fine for what I wanted it for but I had to clean it up before I could use it.  There was food stuff all over it.  The pages were not only dirty but roughed up on the edges.  I felt like I paid too much for the condition it was in 
 When I opened this order, I was totally surprised.  I thought someone had made a mistake and sent me some advertising literature.  I have actually received bigger and better "free" info from advertisers.  This is listed as a 16 page book, but is just a 12 page brochure. Don't waste your money making the writers of this book(?) richer 
 nothing new here same sound same dity's no strecth here just a jam session with no quality. borin 
 In the first part of Palmer's book, I agreed whole heartedly with his observations and assessments regarding knowledge and the use we put that knowledge to at times, such as Oppenheimer's creating the nuclear bomb and claiming, "The physicists have known sin." Palmer astutely points out that we all have a tendency to "succumb to the arrogance that comes when we see what our minds can do," and that we desire to use our knowledge to control our environment. It is this desire to control that has put very deadly power into some unsteady hands. I would have to agree with Palmer on every point here.  Where Palmer loses me about chapter four is when he states, "Truth is personal" and truth can be found only in the relationships we have with one another. I suppose his definition of "truth" and mine are somewhat different, as I believe that truth is most definitely NOT personal - it is what it is, whether I like it or not. Now, what I BELIEVE to be truth and what actually is truth is always open for debate.  The rest of the book is structured around how to alter how we educate our students. While there are definitely some good points and benefits to what Palmer is suggesting, to make this the "fix all" for how to educate students seems a bit closed-minded in its own way. When you consider that everyone learns in a different way, and everyone responds differently to different teaching methods, I don't think there's one perfect "formula" for how to educate people 
 I enjoy the Hillerman Navajo mysteries because the characters are well developed. Not so in this book. I found the first half really boring and hard to get through. The characters were not people you could care about, an important issue for me 
 Terrible textbook. The only goodness is that it mentions lots of details not helpful for  understanding. The concepts are very messy and not clear at all. It could not be a bad  reference book. For a textbook, forget about  it 
 I just saw the author talk about this book for nearly an hour on C-Span 2's Book TV.  He says he researched and wrote and tried to get inside the mind and career of Crockett for three years, and he talked about him for 45 minutes without ever mentioning the fact of human slavery.    Crockett was a slaveholder, and may have also been a slave trader.  In 45 minutes the author not only never mentions this, but never used the word "slave: or :slavery" nor even made indirect allusions to the topic, though it was at the center of American and Southern economic and political life during Crockett's career.  It was common back then for folks down on their luck to purchase some slaves in the East, rope them neck to neck and walk them to Mississippi or Arkansas, when that was the frontier, or in Crockett's heyday, to Texas, where they would sell for three times the value they brought at the point of purchase.  Did that have something to do with Crockett's trek to Texas?  Did he bring any with him?  We'll never know from Buddy Levy.  The secession of Texas from Mexico was largely about the fact that white Texians, as they called themselves, demanded the legalization of slavery, and the right to legally hunt down and return escapees from Arkansas and Louisiana.  On Book TV, Levy talked for forty five minutes, at great length about the secession of Texas and the political climate and happenings there at the time of Crockett's death.  He spent a few minuted detailing the career of Mexican president Santa Ana too, recounting how the white settlers regarded him as a dictator, but never mentioned the dictatorial act which displeased them the most -------- his refusal to allow slavery in Texas.    At the time of the Alamo, one in five "Texians" were slaves.  Make no mistake, despite the author's apparently sanitized version of the history --- that's what Crockett and others died at the Alamo for.  Human slavery.  Based upon his Book TV show and the author's evident big blind spot, if I see his work in a library or bookstore I'll pick it up and look in the index to see if slavery gets mentioned, if there is an index at all.  But I would never buy it, and wouldn't recommend it.  Bruce Dixon Marietta G 
 The case fit well, but only lasted me a few days before the top started to crack apart. I'm very gentle with my phone, but the little pieces of plastic that hold the cover on the side started to pop off one by one. It no longer stays on so I threw it away. THe bottom is still on great, but it dosn't do me any good without a top! 
 Katz's "Dogs of Bedlam Farm" is a litany of Katz's inadequacies as a man and as a dog trainer.  Katz doesn't love dogs (he admits that he dislikes going to places where dogs and people interact, like dog shows, agility or herding trials), he loves HIS dogs.  He loves them so much that he buys them a farm in upstate NY and stocks it with 16 sheep.  Sheep which he constantly whines about having to care for during a bitter NY winter.  He just has to have 16 sheep, five wouldn't be enough apparently, even though they'd be much easier to care for than 16.  Dogs which he loves so much that he lives apart from his wife.  A wife that he SAYS he loves - but apparently not as much as HIS dogs.  If you're getting the idea that I believe that Katz loves his dogs as possessions, you'd be correct.  And, of course, as a source of income as he writes books about them.  And although Katz fails to train two out of three of his Border Collies, so much so, in fact, that he has to give one of his beloved failures away because he thinks he treats the dog as his father treated him. After two failures and although the third dog pretty much trains herself, Katz glories in being known as the local "dog man". As someone who has owned, trained and exhibited dogs for over 50 years, I see little to recommend in this book.   
 This would be a nice addition to the collection of a total Heinlein fan who just can't get enough of the works of a true SF master; otherwise it is merely a collection of cryptic sayings that are better understood in the context of the book(s) from which they are taken.  If you want to understand Heinlein's life philosophy, you should read a variety of his novels.  If you want to see his writing at its finest, read his short stories, especially "All You Zombies".  If you want pithy, useful sayings that give you helpful advice, you should consult to more time-tested sources such as The Book Of Proverbs (the lessons of Lazarus Long were, after all, put in the mouth of a fictional character who increasingly depended on friends with a time machine to pull him out of trouble ... not a resource available to most of you.)  But if you are a Trufan of Heinlein, you definitely need this 
 Before, i purchased this book, i saw the rating is 4.5 stars, i thought the book would be a good one. However, after purchasing the book and read through it, i regret of purchasing this book.  And the reason I regret of purchasing this book, because it's not as interest as i thought it would be.  Doctor Phil writes too much of nonesense before he even tell you the step to correct the problems.  But even when he shows the step to correct the problem, it's nothing interesting to learn neither. I almost given up reading this book many time.  The book really is boring.  I don't find it exciting as i would expected it.   In addition, I like to purchase Dr. Phil book, because i liked his show.  I thought the book should be as good as i watched the show. But it turned out opposite.  I would not buy another book from Dr. Phil.  I grade this book a C or lower, average or below average.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.  It's not worth the money. 
 I think better information can be gained by reading wikipedia than can be gained from reading this book. As a metalhead, I have the feeling that Moynihan is an outsider writing about something he doesn't really understand. Maybe he is just catering to people who aren't familiar with metal, but it's to the detriment of the book's accuracy. I think he misses the point of some bands.  He also does a very quick and sloppy job of some sections, which is annoying.  For example, he states "the Misfits mutated into Samhain...by 1988 the band had changed names again, to simply Danzig", which is totally false. The Misfits ended when Glenn Danzig left the band and formed Samhain, which later became Danzig. Furthermore, the Misfits reunited (without Danzig) in 1997, meaning that Danzig and The Misfits existed as separate bands at the time of the book's printing. It's one of many sloppy errors/hasty summaries in the book that make it frustrating to read.    If you are a fan or already know the story, this book will be nothing but agravation.  If you are an outsider to the genre it should be an interesting read 
 Superficial, biased, gossipy.  All in all, an unworthy book.  For a good read on TR, the 2 volume set by Morris is excellent 
 She seems to have been heavily influenced by both azuza street crowd i.e. much of today's pentecostalism/charasmatics i.e. the toronto/brownsville blessing (a history which is fraught with charlatans and very biblically problemic) and hollywood.   In studying many of her sermons what is readily apparent is the lack of any solid biblical understanding or doctrine. It was just get saved and jesus loves you. A cozy accomodation to the masses who can pretty much define that jesus they want to believe in and then follow.  
 Cute idea but does not work. Camera jams every time you load the pictures. You need an adult to do it and even then it jams. My three-year-old was very disappointed that she could not get it to work 
 You will probably need a BA or BS degree in physics for this book to be understandable to you. If you are just curious about string theory then you will be LOST in this book. I have never seen so many physic/math proofs and formulas in my life! It only made me realize how much other people are smarter than myself. Buy Steven Hawking's A Briefer History in Time for a lay person's guide to string theory and other interesting theories if you don't want to spend a gigantic amount of brain power 
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 Pygmalion centers on a woman who cannot speak to save her life. She is the most interesting of the three main characters but also the worst to focus on. She is boring to the point of tears. She is poor, hungry, and happy. It is a typical underdog story where two rich and powerful men who happen to be specialists in her area of need -language-happen upon her in a gloomy British rain. Surprised? I was not. Shaw cut right to the point; after all, it is a short play. I do not blame Shaw for making it short, more of Higgins and I would have put the play down.  Should we try to pinpoint why the two men, more so Higgins, decide to tutor and to change Eliza, we come across purely selfish motives. Eliza sells flowers on the street in order to feed herself, and later goes to Higgins to learn proper English in order to become a shop-owner. Higgins wants to change her into a proper girl in order to prove that he is the greatest linguistics tutor, also, to win a bet...how egocentric. Selfish acts drive this play along. Here, the class struggle also comes into play as Eliza must not only refrain from using the only language she knows, but must change the way in which she holds herself in front of society. Shaw wrote Eliza's character very precisely to have individual dignity and determination to help her achieve her goals. The one thing I liked.  The play is about adaptation and transformation. Eliza's incredible strength moves the play along more quickly despite Higgins' pompous attitude slowing it down. Then again, without the diametrically opposed characters the play would not work.   Interesting class struggle and realistic language effort but overall, just a so-so read. Shaw has a good point: it takes effort to move up to bourgeoisie. He has all the right characters: a poor, pretty girl with a desire to learn, a snotty old Professor who is full of himself and a rich gentleman to provide the budget. Unfortunately, and perhaps due to the year I was born, the generation I grew up in and my penchant for sex and scandal, I found it rather dry. I am glad I read it, but will likely not pick it up again.  
 Fukuyama misunderstands history in a way that is not entirely his own.  One need only leaf through the pages of Hegel to find such unfounded optimism.   As a scholar, I recently took a look at what would be the continuation of Fukuyama's statistical work.  That is, the growth of democracy, and it's funny how that growth has been curbed in the past 10 years or so.  Time will show this book to be Fukuyama's Folly 
 When it works it does extend the range. However, every time you turn off a wirelessly connected PC and turn it on again, the PC is not assigned an IP number. Unplug this extender, and the PC is assigned an IP number by the router without any problem. A brief power blackout will cut IP numbers to your wirelessly-connected PCs. I purchased this particular D-link range extender because I wanted to ensure that it works well with my DI-624 router. I wasted my money buying this device. It's useless, and it's too light to even serve as a door stop.. 
 I wish Mr. Sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels. That flow and voice I understood so well. At First Sight felt like I was reading a deadline novel. Just words, no insight, didn't make this reader think at all. Sorry, just the way I read it. 
 The dialogue in the last three books in the center is not engaging. This was difficult to finish. It seems every scene centered around, "I'm sorry. 
 The timing in this story is achingly slow, compared to many of today's novels...the language is not particularly metaphorical or even colorful, although the sentences are short.  But lacking dialogue it remains dull, dull and I am unable to visualize the characters - more description is needed, and frankly, if it wasn't for previous success he may not have been published.  I feel you have to be an anglophile to appreciate this book 
 I think the biggest problem with this book is that it was published and edited by his parents.  I admit I thought it was pretty bad, in fact it was some of the worst fantasy I have ever read.  When a real editer would have helped this very weak writing come up to snuff, instead his parents went along with him 
 This is a good example of the typical self-delusion of creationism passing as serious thought.  All the book really proves in its pages is that if a person wishes something to be so badly enough, it will become so, but only in his or her own mind.  The stratigraphic "evidence" is selectively presented in a distortive, inaccurate fashion, so as to suit conclusions previously reached.  The serious reader on the subject is far better advised to read Kurten's "Not From the Apes", and not some drivel like this book 
 I couldn't get past the very stylized dialogue which seemed to coming from the same source although different actors were speaking.  The characters are cliches through and through and does anyone really speak the way the people do? Mamet appears to have never left Manhattan and has no clue to writing non urban roles or a script with enough nuance to delineate his characters perspective.  To be honest I didn't finish the entire film, but instead checked the TV Guide for reruns of Northern Exposure for the real thing 
 I found this book to be almost annoying in the level of arrogance the author exuded in her writing.  She has absolutely no training in psychology apart from the fact that her daughters struggled with eating disorders.  This book did not reveal any new insights or cures.  I find it appalling how little training she has in the arena of eating disorders and yet feels qualified to open a clinic and write a book.  She does not back any of her statements up with scientific data, and the book seems to be trying to sell her clinic more than inform others on how to help those struggling with eating disorders.  
 On our beloved Kay Scarpetta and the illustrious Ms. Cornwell?  Having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning, I simply cannot help but ask myself....is she really writing this stuff? Very slow in the beginning, I began to fear a repeat of the struggle that I endured to finish Blowfly.  However, this novel does begin to pick up momentum...but not until the reader is halfway through, and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted.  The storyline finds Scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime...Richmond, Virginia, where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl.  So Scarpetta---with Marino tagging along of course---heads back to Richmond from her new home in Florida to offer assistance; only to find that her old building is being demolished...and that the new one, under the leadership of Dr. Joel Marcus, is sloppy regarding policies and procedures.  The demoralization of her former staff by Dr. Marcus is also unnerving to Scarpetta; and clearly he resents her intrusion. So why has he asked her to come? Meanwhile, Lucy, as head of The Last Precinct, is once again up to her ears in nonsense.  For such a brilliant, successful young woman (as readers have always been lead to believe), why must Cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life?  In this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee. Worse than the weak storyline, and the fact that this novel is just all over the place, is the author's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of African-Americans throughout.  Drug dealers are black, they're dead of gunshot wounds, and most ludicrous of all is in one instance Cornwell references a dead young man's "conspicuously large organ."  Are you kidding me?  The trash collectors are "big dark men" and of course in an upscale neighborhood, the "old black woman" must WORK in one of the houses.  The author's unbelievably narrow-minded, stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best, and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as Lucy.  Read only if you must, but frankly there are better ways to spend your time.   DY 
 This is a terrible book.  Having read many of Dumas' other books, I expected a story about a dashing young hero who would fight with the blood thirsty rabble in Paris to rescue the innocent victims of the revolution.  Instead, I found an aimless and unbelievable plot that proceeded to kill off all the heros and heroines in the book.  I was left totally perplexed about why Dumas bothered to write this awful book 
 I had this one figured out by the second chapter. Too predictable and shallow. Hopefully, the next Stone book will actually be worth reading 
 This book is basically a magazine article that has been expanded to fill out an entire book (this has been noted by others) Anything of interest is said in the first chapter, followed by a lot of fluff - "sometimes the crowd is wise" "sometimes the crowd is not wise".  After the first chapter, I seriously couldn't read for more than 10 minutes without getting bored 
 First off, Starship Troopers is one of my top ten books period.  Well done Mister Heinlein.  This book?  In a word--UGH!   The dialogue is laughable at times, noxious at others, and sometimes entertaining enough to keep you reading to see what comes next.  Sometimes what comes next is plausible and exciting and entertaining.  Sometimes it is none of those.  And at one point, it's jaw-droppingly shocking and nauseating:            Main male character, former military officer, is someone you learn to like a lot as you read through the book.  Until you suddenly find out he's bisexual around page 300.  And had a homosexual experience he didn't find unpleasant with a Boy Scout Leader when he was a kid.  Thanks for springing that on us just before the end.    Bottom line:  Do not recommend.  But Starship Troopers--get 2 copies...one to read, one to lend out 
 It would be so easy to suggest a main title for the review in an obvious word play of the film, such as "this film should've stayed quiet" or "film doesn't follow own advice and shut up" but that's too easy. Because basically watching the film you start to notice you almost like it for the wrong reasons. Director Jamie Babbit, previously known for directing lesbian drama But I'm a Cheerleader, shows a family with much sordid details and secrets but just not the right approach.  The Deer family (don't laugh, that's their last name) adopt Dot, a deaf-mute who becomes a quick target for the daughter, Nina. However, Dot's seemingly useful ability to hear but not hear what people say brings about some family secrets and tension and ultimately the bigger question is what secret does Dot have that she's not sharing?  Sometimes there are lines that are obviously meant to bring about a laughter, where because it's ridiculous and toilet humor, scatching and political or just a knowing laugh like a "I know how that is". But it's a bad sign when a line, meant to be serious, brings laughter. There are several lines like this in the film including one involving a guy talking about his "manhood". The story isn't that well-written either.  The family secret is pretty rough but there's no emotional connection so the only thing bad about the secret is what it actually is and not how it affects anyone in the film.  How's the actors? Well after awhile you mistake hotness for acting. While Camille Belle was surprising in a film called the Ballad of Jack and Rose, here she's pretty good but there's not a lot of depth to the character whereas Elisha Cuthbert, equally hot, has tons of depth but maybe not acting chops at times. While she is given enough time to develop a character, it's unfortunately not enough time before we're whisked somewhere else. Then there's the whole "Dot's secret" which would've worked if she didn't narrate and there was enough scenes to have you already guessing what it was.  If there's nothing else to rent and can't find anything, give it a shot but perhaps it's best to just admire Belle and Cuthbert with the sound off. Ugh, another "quiet" joke 
 I was so disappointed in this book. I have bought many horse books, but this one was certainly the worst. I think it is a pitty that force and strength is substituted for time and patience and really *teaching* a young  horse to be confident and trusting rather than be afraid and just submit  while it cant move, being tied in hobbles...every lesson praticly was  introducing hobbles. I thought it was disgusting. If anyone would STILL  like to buy the book, you can take mine for half price!kmrothmann@aol.co 
 What a disappointment! Poorly written, bitter, jealous and small minded. Less said the better 
 Nothing like EON. EON is the one. This was a hack sequel with no guts. Very dissapointing 
 The authors of this book touch on many subjects, giving very little detail in any of them.  The legal and accounting loopholes are very basic - and they keep referring you to other products and sites they've written/published - making this book one big commercial.  In one area, when talking about the benefits of real estate investment, the fail to even mention costs associated with using equity, cash flow, repairs, etc.  I am a new entrant to real estate investing, and would not recommend this book to anyone.  It is no different than the get rich quick schemes you see on tv/internet 
 Unfortunately, this application includes only a Mac OS 9 (not the Mac OS X as advertised) version.  I cannot review the cds in general, as I cannot run them.  Why did they re-publish the 1998 software in 2006, again in Mac OS 9?  Frustrating 
 Next to Branson's "Screw It, Lets Do It", the most poorly written book (short or long) I have ever read. Like his "Screw It..." book, appears Branson got this one published only because he owns the publishing company. Ditto from my review of his "Screw It..." book -- appears making a few bucks on his earlier "Virginity" book made him think he could rephrase content and sell as two more books with more or less merely different titles.  Apparently Branson runs his business world better than he writes. 
 Jack London's efforts at social novels, such as "Iron Heel" and "Martin Eden" were failures, because they are very cardboard and unconvincing. Jack London, the master story teller of the juvenile boys adventure novels, had a social conscience, but was not very good with expressing the social issues of the day, issues which usually belong in manifestos, not in literature. Jack London was no Dostoievsky, a true literary giant 
 This book is atrocious. No one with any respect for logic or science should even consider buying it. 
 Chuck has nothing to worry about here. While Drake has a great voice and a vivid imagination this book just ran out of steam. It probably would have worked better as a short story. I found Nita's self-imposed hardships to be quite grating after about 100 pages and there were still 200 pages of the same to go. It all got a bit repetitious and obvious after awhile. I also didn't find the book funny. I didn't laugh once. I have to add that I am in no way the sharpest tool in the shed but even I saw the ending coming a mile away. 
 J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.   In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.  This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.  Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.  As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.  My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book 
 This is the 3rd and by far the most disappointing of all.  The sound doesn't work. Yes, I put the batteries in correctly and yes I turned it on. The van/car kept getting stuck.  My son was very disappointed and can only play pretend with it. I didn't pay all that money for an interactive toy and it doesn't work. Very disappointed in all these sets and will not buy another 
 Peter Tremayne's books have interesting plots and the stories are told well.  But beware, if you're looking for a satisfying, historically accurate view of seventh-century Ireland.  Tremayne (a pseudonym of the popular historian Peter Berresford Ellis) certainly knows about Irish law.  But widening circles show more and more ignorance.  The physical environment of a monastery in this period is simply wrong, ranging from construction to scale (the evil monastery of this volume sounds more like a great Benedictine monastery of the twelfth century than anything of the likes of Clonmacnois or Glendalough).  There's extreme oddity in terminology, such as the plural French word "religieux" to describe a single monk, or "noviciate" in place of "novice," both of which suggest he knows little of monastic life.  But most disturbing about this book is the utterly false picture it paints of "Roman" Christianity in the early Middle Ages---stating specifically that ecclesiastical authorities suppported and enforced death penalties, regularly engaged in corporal punishment, etc., through a bizarre law system labeled as "the Penitentials."  This stuff just isn't true 
 After many years, I decided to finally give Kathy Reichs' Temperance Brennan series a go.  So, where better to start than her debut novel 'Deja Dead' which introduces Reichs' heroine.  Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist working in Montreal for what I'm guessing is the French-Canadian equivalent of a Medical Examiner's office.  Of course our heroine is head strong, independent, and unlucky in love (aren't they all?).  Well, some murders start turning up and, amazingly enough, our intrepid anthropologist is the only person that links the crimes together.  Do the police believe her?  No, so she must investigate the crimes on her own.  And by doing so, the murderer then turns his attention to Brennan and her family and friends (don't all killers eventually do that?).  First off, the book is bloated.  The book (at least the paperback version) clocks in at about 530 pages.  Reichs' writes too much about menial tasks that her character, Brennan, does during her usual day.  Does anyone really want to hear repeatedly about what a character had for dinner or what paperwork she does at work?  I know I don't want to read it.  Now I'm a person who enjoys a nice, long book but 'Deja Dead' (where did she get that title anyway?) is about two hundred pages too long.  And it is a very slow read.    Secondly, her main character, Brennan, just isn't likeable.  In fact, I found her quite annoying.  The policemen in the novel are portrayed as incompetent, arrogant jerks who are too worried about being right than they are about doing the right thing.  When in fact I think that they just didn't want to deal with this overly nosy anthropologist who is obviously stepping on toes and irritating people who are just trying to do their jobs.  Reichs' tries to portray Brennan as a lone crusader fighting against all these odds to get to the criminal.  When in fact she is an irritating anthropologist who has no business investigating a murder.  She is, basically, a laboratory-based employee who should not be in the field.  So I don't blame the cops in the book that don't like her.  She's butting her nose in where it doesn't belong and, in a part I actually liked, she ends up bringing irreparable damage to her family and friends.  I thought it a just outcome.  Also, after about the twentieth time of Brennan looking at some cop's rear end and saying "I like the way his butt looks...Oh, stop!  You need to get laid." I wanted to scream.  Dr. Brennan, at least in this debut novel, is extremely irritating.  Thirdly, I have read the basic plot of this book in a hundred other novels.  The suprise "switcheroo" ending is not suprising but more annoying...  It is just a cheap way to trick the reader.  And if I have to read about one more main character who ends up becoming the target of the "killer", I will scream.  Its pathetic.  How many times does it need to be written?  Its ridiculous.  Now, 'Deja Dead' is the first of Reichs' books that I've read.  I've heard that the following books in the Brennan series are better and I certainly hope this is the case.  I really didn't like the book:  not the characters, the plot, the writing...  But I will give Reichs another try and read the next book in the series.  If its as bad as 'Deja Dead', I don't think I ever read another one her books 
 I bought 2 sleepers.  sleeper had holes in the arm pit area and the other sleeper had a whole where the neck trim should of been sewed on. A real waste of my money 
 The few times I looked something up in this book, I could not find it.  I presume it was not there because the verb form was rare or not the most common one for that tense.  Unfortunately, that was what I bought this book for.  However beginners may indeed find it very helpful.  Once you reach an intermediate level, you will have to use something else 
 In Edward Klein's The Kennedy Curse: Why America's First Family Has Been Haunted by Tragedy for 150 Years, there isn't much new here except for pure gossip, rumor and innuendo.    Klein starts off to make this a pseudo-scientific study of facts contributing to the Kennedy curse including lots of psycho-babble, genetic factors, etc.  He claims his book is a detective story.  He tries to show how "the Irish immigrant experience of poverty and humiliation developed into an obsessive lust for power and dominance over others at the expense of all ethical behavior."  Throw in domineering fathers, cold mothers, alcohol, drugs, sex, thrill-seeking behavior, ADHD, restlessness, boredom and impatience, and you get a prescription for tragedy.  Many people believe a black cloud has followed the Kennedy family for many generations.  It actually appears that the Kennedy's followed the black cloud on their own.    In trying to prove his curse theory, Klein spotlights seven family members including immigrant Patrick Kennedy, Joe Kennedy, Sr., Kathleen (Kick) Kennedy, JFK, William Kennedy Smith, JFK, Jr., and JFK's maternal grandfather, John Honey Fitz Fitzgerald.  He barely mentions other Kennedy's that have suffered tragedies including Bobby Kennedy, Ted Kennedy, and Joe Kennedy, Jr.  It was interesting to read about the immigrant experience of the Irish, as well as some of the lesser known family members including Kathleen Kennedy and Honey Fitz.  But overall, there isn't much new here, and what is new seems mostly rumor and innuendo.  For instance, Klein accuses JFK of having "chronic venereal disease" and claims it is possible that this caused the death of his pre-mature son, Patrick.  This is a pretty serious allegation to make without proof.  He also tells how Carolyn Bessette Kennedy's friends destroyed her drug stash after that fateful plane crash.  I don't believe the Kennedy's are saints and I know they've done some atrocious things, but give us hard facts.  Overall, my recommendation is to skip The Kennedy Curse.  If you want to read more about this fated family, there are much better and more comprehensive books to be had.  It is hard to believe this book was written by a Pulitzer Prize-winning author. 
 This is a movie about a big girl who gets 'made over' and becomes thin, finds love and lives happily ever after. It's a spoof on romantic comedies, sort of like "Scary Movie" is a spoof on horror movies but this was not nearly as funny. I didn't like this movie. It tried hard to be funny but it wasn't. It was just a yawner! It relied on cheap, stereotypical and often sexist jokes and tired parodies which will be forgotten in a few years and be even less funny. I wasn't deeply offended by this movie but I disliked the way it objectified women (i.e. showing a fat girl going to a body shop like a car to get made skinny and the super hot ex-girlfriend who looks and acts slutty and the boyfriend who thinks it's appropriate to have his ex hang all over him) I am fine with sex and nudity in movies but I didn't like the message behind this film. It was mindless and painful to watch and made me uncomfortable. I happen to be young and thin and generally have a good sense of humor about sexist jokes but something about this movie just left me with a yucky feeling! I feel like this movie insulted my intelligence. There are plenty of things in this world which make young women feel bad about the way they look and it's generally not a quality I look for in a so-called comedy! This is funny if you are male and under the age of 16 and even then, this movie might be a bit overboard!           
 So, the elite of the entertainment industry are as debased and filled with hubris as the elite of any of America's industries, as well as its politicians.  So what? The only difference between Hollywood's freaks and the freaks of say, The Energy Industry, is that the Hollywood folks have thousands of photographers and reporters following them around 24/7. Why? because they are more interesting, more attractive and more colorful than the grey men and women of America's boardrooms.  Drugs, alcohol, gambling, pornography, prostitution, abuse, infidelity... these things are all epidemic across America.  The practice of and desire for these things result in multi-billion dollar industries. Who is spending all this money? Hollywood elites? No. It is all of America. Its your neighbors. Its you. The difference is, when your fat balding insurance adjuster neighbor orders up an escort, who cares? But when a movie star orders up a hooker, tabloids, and the "normal Americans" who breathlessly await the next juicy "scandal," can't wait to chronicle and publicize it infinitum.  Hollywood is America's Dream Maker and its Holy Distraction.  Not only does it produce the films, TV shows and music that we love to watch/hear for fun and relaxation, it also provides the scandals, gossip and (im)morality plays that the public just can't get enough of.  The only thing that Americans love more than watching their glamorous, larger than life celebrities live their fabulous lives is watching them falter and get torn down in public.  Its voyeurism, pure and simple. We love to watch them climb the ladder and we love even more to watch them fall off of it.   Rather than pointing the fingers at those "others" out in Hollywood, the authors of this screed, along with professional blamers and loudmouths like Bill O'Reilly, should instead take a look in the mirror.  After all, like it or not, the kinds of entertainment and entertainers that we choose is a reflection of who we collectively are as a culture.  If our chosen forms of distractions are "immoral" and created by "immoral people" perhaps its because the consumers (US!) are "immoral."  Or perhaps there's not much about it that's immoral at all. maybe its just human nature that a small percentage of finger-waggers and busybodies like to vilify for fun and profit.  Hollywood is the ultimate example of what the Free Market creates. Like it or not, this is what the American public wants.  When you go to the supermarket, you have about 5-7 brands of toothpaste you can choose. When you want to fill up at the pump you have to choose between 4-5 gasoline providers.  But when you turn on your TV, there are dozens of different shows that you can chose from at any given time. Don't like any of them? Wait a half hour, they'll be dozens more. Want to go to a movie, dozens out at any given time. Want to rent a DVD? Hundreds to choose from. Buy a CD? thousands available.  So, which is more a reflection of the REAL AMERICA? The 4-7 brands that we must chose from when we buy toothpaste and gas?  Or the hundreds to thousands of choices we have at any time when we want to spend some time relaxing with an entertainment product?  America, Hollywood is your funhouse mirror 
 Generally like the program. Hoped it came with a CD to practice in the car but was wrong. It is totally PC based. I'll let you know in about three months if I can actually conduct business in Deutsch. 
 I chose this book for a college writing class assignment. I had to read it, then critically review it. I've always been an avid reader, and no book has ever made me feel stupid, but this one succeeded. It almost felt like Rick Moody was trying hard to use as many confusing words, sentences, and formats he could think of. Some of the stories took me days to get through, and I only finished them because I had to. Some were better than others; I sort of liked "Boys" and "Forecast From the Retail Desk", but everything else left me with a headache. The worst were "Pan's Fair Throng", "The Carnival Tradition" (still have no idea what that was about), "Ineluctable Modality of the Vaginal" (16 pages - 1 sentence - give me a break), and the two "list" stories: "Wilkie Fahnstock: The Boxed Set" and "Surplus Value Books: Catalogue Number 13". None of the stories had any real character development, and some had no recognizable plots. There are maybe people who will understand this stuff better than I, but this is still not a book I would recommend to anyone I know. If you're someone looking for enjoyable short stories, please don't buy this book.  
 If you want to read a great book on personal illness by a fine writer, read Reynolds Price' "A Whole New Life."  The prose is authentic and there is not a touch of pretense in it.   Styron's lack of insight into his illness is topped only by his lack of knowledge of abnormal psychology.  His declaration that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance is disturbing, because it mixes cause and effect.  His assertion is tantamount to attributing global warming to melting glaciers.  Mixing cause and effect is not something one would attribte to a writer of his distinction, as it is the essence of clear thought.  Yes, the intensity and distribution of various neuro-chemicals have been found to be compromised among those suffering depression who have been tested.  But how are they compromised?  Contrary to the author's belief that "the madness results from an aberrant biochemical process," and that "such madness is chemically induced," it is the commonly-held view today that psychology plays the decisive causitive role in mental illness, as that psychology is formulated and developed throughout life, and is influenced by situations, including loss, misuse of drugs and alcochol, and unconscious dilemmas, among others.   That an organic etiology has been surmised in many cases of schizophrenia and other psychosis, as well as in profound obsessions, certainly "rules in" brain damage, whether it is evident at birth, or the result of other physical and emotional trauma later in life; but it does not rule out psychology and the higher order mental functions we attribute to consciousness.       
  I haven't seen a movie so one-sided since the Contender. They didn't even try to make good arguments for the pro-gun side. I hate to use the term Liberal Bias but in this case it fits like a glove. The cards in this movie were so stacked against the defense team that by the end of the movie I felt like the gun companies were the underdogs. Pure garbage.   
 It doesn't break any black box. The author writes with it's usual clarity but the text does not keep up with it's promises at all. It generalizes about trading systems but it does not give any real advise. It is in line with the author who is good in teaching the basis of TA but nothing else. Unfortunately famous persons obtain a large following even with routine and useless productions like this. John Sweeney, in the back cover page of the book, states: "....a good introduction to system developments and helpul in supplying trading ideas....". That is right: introduction, no more. Ideas, right or wrong, are everywhere. Also don't get fooled by the CD ROM which comes with the book. It is just a tutorial (no productive software) and, in order to force you to see his site, where you are offered other (a lot of) things, the CD runs only with MS WIN NT. I was able to use it with Win 2000 but why not produce and offer it for the most widespread WIN operating system? Unfortunately exploiting losers is the rule. Extremely sad! Don't buy this book. There are a lot of them much better on trading systems 
 This title is filled to the brim with propaganda and lies. The Israelis are simply doing what they need to to survive. In 1967, they struck before Egypt had a chance and the Arab powers were obliterated. In 1973 Egypt struck back, in an effort to gain their territory they had previously lost. But at the core of this conflict, and what preceded it, was the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when as soon as Israel gained independence, she was attacked ferociously by a horde of greedy Arabs. Israel repulsed them in less than a year, but the battle rages on and she is repeatedly and unprovokingly attacked (guerilla warfare and full blown battle) by the Palestinians. It doesn't seem you can convince this to the author. All that Israel has done has been in response to terrorism. Israel even gave up land (virtually all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip) and the Palestinians are simply not appeased.  I think the author is brain dead, because this is pure stupidity and Palestinian propaganda. Don't buy it 
  This book is about maintaining relationships with abusive, destructive, untrustworthy, and downright dangerous people, who are euphemistically referred to as "high-maintenance". The victim of such an abuser is encouraged to keep the relationship together at all costs and given suggestions for adapting to and living with the abuse, including becoming more sympathic to his abuser by recognizing the exact same abusive tendency in himself-which may be true for some characteristics but is quite a stretch if you are going to assume EVERYONE has EVERY offensive trait to some degree.   The author makes the victim solely responsible for staying in an abusive relationship without ever confronting the abuser or understanding that the time may come when it is necessary to leave the relationship for one's own sanity or mental, emotional, spiritual, and even physical health. The abusive person is absolved of all responsibility for his own behavior.   The book never addresses the extreme damage long-term exposure to abusers does to a victim, nor does it address the responsiblity of others to stand up to evil and protect weaker people , such as children in the family, from it.  The author quotes Scripture as a rationale and justification for his premise of tolerating ongoing abuse; however, Scripture does not support this thinking. In the Bible, we are held responsible for our behavior. The Bible tells us to forgive AS GOD FORGAVE US (Ephesians 4:32, Colossians 3:13).God forgives us when we come to him, confess our sin, ask for forgiveness (apologize) and REPENT (turn from our sinful ways).(see Ezekiel 33:10-19, Isaiah 55:6, Jeremiah 6:16 & 26:3, Luke 13:3 & 5, Acts 3:19). He does NOT forgive those who are 'stiff-necked', continue doing evil, or refuse to repent. The Lord does not expect more of us than he himself is willing to do! God requires repentance, and so should we.     TAKE HEED TO YOURSELVES: IF THY BROTHER TRESPASS AGAINST THEE, REBUKE HIM; AND IF HE REPENT, FORGIVE HIM.....Luke 17:3    Luke 17:3 is the scripture often misquoted, usually by an abuser or his enabler, when he tells you that the Bible says 'Forgive and Forget', or that you must forgive him because you are a Christian. However, Jesus is very specific when He tells us to REBUKE the sinner, and IF HE REPENTS, to forgive him.   In Matthew 18:15-17, Jesus gives us a model for rebuking one who sins against us, and ends by telling us to "treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector" (shun him) if he refuses to listen. God does not want us to continue to be abused, in fact, we are told a number of times to shun evildoers (Psalm 37:9, Psalm 119:115, Matthew 18:17, Titus 3:10-11, 1 Corinthians 5:11).   Additionally, a distinction must be made between forgiveness and reconciliation, or remaining in a relationship. We CAN forgive and still choose not to remain in relationship with one who has betrayed or abused us. We are not required to expose ourselves or our loved ones to harmful, destructive, or dangerous people. "Warn a divisive person once, then warn him a second time. After that, HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM. You may be sure that such a man is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned"....Titus 3:10-11  Furthermore, we are very clearly instructed in the Scriptures to rebuke wicked people. "Those who sin are to be rebuked publicly, so that the others may take warning".....1 Timothy 5:20NIV    "When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul"....Ezekiel 33: 8-9 KJV. Doing our best to STOP evil is required for us to save our own souls.  A much more helpful book about handling abusive relationships from a Biblical perspective is "Boundaries" by Drs. Henry Cloud and John Townsend, who are well-known Christian psychologists. This book will truly teach victims of abuse how to deal with abusive people, and it also includes Scriptural teachings.   I was very disappointed in High- Maintenance Relationships and do not recommend it to anyone dealing with such people. Victims of Back-stabbers, Control- Freaks, Green-Eyed Monsters, Steamrollers, Critics, Volcanoes, and the other "characters" in this book have enough problems without being made to feel as if the sole responsibility for making a success out of a relationship with a toxic person, who merrily continues on harming others, is on their shoulders, and if the relationship fails, it is their fault because they could have done more to salvage it.   As the director of Luke 17:3 Miinistries for Adult Daughters of Abusive or Controlling Birth-families, I feel that this book may do more harm than good. It victimizes a person who is the target of abuse a second time- by making him feel guilty for not improving and continuing his relationship with someone the book itself refers to as "impossible." If you really need help and are looking for a book with constructive actions you can take, this is not it.  God wants us to be FREE from wicked people, and HE will free us if we obey his word and follow HIS instructions for dealing with them. "They have greatly oppressed me from my youth, but they have not gained the victory over me. Plowmen have plowed my back and made their furrows long. But the Lord is righteous; he has cut me free from the cords of the wicked"....Psalm 129:2-4              
 This book was horrible! There was no logical order to the book because it is just a bunch of stories put together about Duveen. It is so boring, all the book does is talk about how dumb millionares were and how they were stupid enough to buy from Duveen and his crazy ways. This book was so bad, please save yourself the time and money and not buy this book 
 What's worse than a bad cd?  "The Burdens of Being Upright."  I don't even know where to start.  I bought it because I really liked the first song "Mother Mother" (which is the only reason why Tracy Bonham even gets 2 stars from me)... and I was completely disappointed with the rest of the album.  The songs aren't interesting and the whole thing all in all is just simply not worth the money.  Unless its used and only costs like, two bucks.  Actually, when I went to to trade it in at the record store, they only offered me 25 cents for it because they have so many copies of it and nobody wants them.  And I took the quarter! If you like grunge music, there's a chance that you might like this, but you most likely still won't 
 I liked the title because I feel just the same way about my soon to be born granddaughter and first grandchild.  I cannot buy it though because I cannot identify with the elderly grandmother on the cover. Most grandmothers look much younger and are more vibrant than the woman on the cover 
 The title says it all. They could have put a better group of songs togather 
 Joan Jett used to be an artist who I liked until this joke. Her idea of making fun of the president just sets me off. She is an idiot and needs to leave politics out of her music. She is just another worthless liberal. I will never listen to this album again. She deserves 0 stars 
 This product was such a waste. The little granules made a mess when used as a styling agent for blow-drying the hair. I will not repurchase it. 
 Purported knowledge not IN style anymore by the socalled academic elites.  Evolution, in the boxing ring got a KO by Professional scientists who UNderstand that KO means down.  Who LIVES for evolution other than those who live IN illusion.  Some day there will be enough people on EArTh to expose the lies of this ridiculous theory.  Until Then, Lies they will tell, and Exceptional lies they will be 
 AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I bought this for a little over $15 at another store and returned it within a week...Horrible transfer (if it were ALPHA video i wouldn't care, but come on...this is a major DVD company we're talking about, SONY!!!!!). Aspect ratio isnt the theatrical format, but rather PAN AND SCAN cropped sides bulls#it. Plus its missing like 20 minutes! I wouldn't recommend this for anyone. Just the thought of this release makes me angry (to the point of inarticulate). AVOID AVOID AVOID! and write a letter to your congressman (ha!)...or perhaps SONY/MGM. This release is inexcusable 
 There ~are~ reasons to commend this book, like the bountiful illustrations, the charts showing the evolution of Chinese characters, etc.  What I fault is that at many points the author departs from accuracy and injects over-Europeanized interpretations of Chinese mythology and symbols (for instance, characterizing Tibetan Lamas as "devil-worshippers" and calling the Chinese place of the dead and its god, "Hades" - repeatedly).  To be truthful, some of the illustrations are so poorly drawn that you cannot really make out what they are.  The text is easy to read and the topics covered numerous.  I would use this book with caution, however, checking Williams' interpretations against other, more recent sources.  For the record, I am giving this book a two because the only other reviewer to write about it gave it a five and that is far too high for it.  I think this should yield an average of three, which is about right for this book 
 Never again will I buy another Deep Purple Album with Coverdale.  He just goes on and on with his boring vocals.  No interesting interplays like in Fireball.  I give it two stars only because the title track is decent.  Stay away unless you like pop music 
 I had never read a novel by Tom Wolfe, and I certainly won't read another one.  Tom Wolfe is so out of touch with Southern culture, youth culture, and the 21st century that I actually felt embarassed for him.  With impressive diligence, Wolfe painstakingly mapped out the Southern dialogue for the reader with complete disregard for Georgia's actual dialect.  Hey Tom, not every Southerner sounds like a 19th century Savannah plantation owner.  Secondly, at times, I actually became physically uncomfortable with Wolfe's attempt to manufacture rap songs and names of rap artists.  In fact, his book seemed to be a never-ending stream of stereotypes elaborated with self-indulgent purple prose. Third, where was the middle-class?  Virtually every character was either "living on the hill" or "by the railroad tracks".  Wolfe focused on only the most superficial aspects of Atlanta culture--including his tedious and pointless descriptions of downtown Atlanta.  Finally, when I crawled my way across 800 pages, it seemed that Wolfe just gave up on any kind of ending; a former tycoon became a Stoic Evangelist (give me a break!), a convict turned himself over to the police...The End.  
 Listening to the Standards being sung by Rod Stewart is like listening to Classical Music being played on a kazoo! If you're new to this music, try out some Sinatra CD's. He's the guy who sets the standard when it comes to singing the Standards 
 Typical sophomore effort that displays A) some understanding of how little the writer knew in the previous book, and B) that a distinct effort was made to learn how to write.  Not enough effort, however.  The doping storyline is difficult to judge because it's so unbelievable.  Some details ring true and some do not.  A few more good details with a knowing touch (i.e., "the chair is yellow") would have sufficed.  The bigger problem is the villian, who is basically Aaron from "Titus Andronicus."  Motiveless malice taken too baby-eating extremes.    In sum, typical pablum that makes you want your three hours back 
 I've been a designer for 5 years now, so the basic information this book gave about the different design specialties that have color specialists was not news to me.  It is such basic information, I think it might be geared toward high schoolers trying to pick a career or college major, or else it's geared toward people who are in a completely different field who know nothing about design professions.  In short, it did not help me to know what I can do to get from being a space planner/designer to a color specialist/designer

 this is the cut down version of the 3 hour pilot that universel released in theaters after the show went belly up in '78. if you buy the whole series you can skip this pointless rehash that isn't that good or very well thought out 
 Somehow this book ended up being a required text in my full-time MBA program.  We complained so much that this was a 1st year 'college level' book and not appropriate at our level that my school discontinued it the following year.  Now I can't resell my 'unused' version on campus.  What a waste 
 I love Georgette Heyer's books, particularly her later ones.  This book was such a disappointment.  It was tedious, with unlikeable characters and no romance.  The book never seemed to build to a climax just dragged on.  Do not buy this book - look for The Grand Sophy or The Reluctant Widow 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 I have to agree that words used in word smart series are not often seen on GRE tests themselves. I made tons of note cards and i did not see even one from my extended note card collection. 
 I'm not into R&B so i'll skip the tracks i'm not interested in. Bought it only for Junior Vasquez Dub which is i must say really bad. Totally boring. I think Junior should release his latest work (Simone Denny - Cliche, Deepa Soul - As I Am)  on CD's instead of letting us buy only his worse mixes. Very unsatisfied 
 Received the 'first' unit which was missing cables and had a non-functional remote.  Played MP3's, mov, and displayed pictures fine.  Would have been happy enough if all the parts were present and working.  Returned this unit and received a second which didn't work, didn't even have a remote or speakers (561 in a 562 box?).  Time for another replacement - which came without remote, with speakers, but faulty software or micro?  Menu's one deep were blank rectangles which didn't function and MP3's which played on the first unit locked up this unit - same for mov files.  Actually tried a forth time because the first unit seemed to be OK functionally, but last unit was exactly the same as previous with blank menu's and faulty functionality.  E-mailed Digital Spectrum and have not received a reply, which actually led me to write this feedback!  Hard to believe this company will survive if they don't straighten up their act 
 BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER, the textbook currently used in my Introduction to Management class, does not effectively convey the important fundamentals of business management.  The book is structured around eight 'roles' of an effective manager, and each role is further broken down into a number of competencies that are functions of that particular role.  While I appreciate the effort to organize a relatively broad subject, I do not feel that the book is necessarily easy to follow.  The reading is constantly being interrupted by assessments and applications for each competency, and while meant well, they are usually skipped over in an attempted to finish the reading and they seem to me to be a large waste of paper.  Furthermore, BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER stresses models and theories of management that I find useless without the necessary fundamentals of management, which are not adequately presented in the textbook.  Some of the models and theories have merit and should be discussed more in depth, but in a more advanced level of business management.  And while BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER is the official textbook for my management class, I have relied heavily on a different textbook for my information, and only the eve of a test do I bother to look over BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER, I do not recommend this textbook for an introductory class at all 
 I was VERY unhappy with my book purchase. When I recieved it the first thing I noticed was a VERY unpleasant odor coming from the book. I thought it would go away but it did not. It was one of the most disgusting and vulgar smells I have ever smelt. I could not even read the book without getting nausious. I asked for a replacement and they said there was nothing they could do and that is was probaly just the ink. I tried everything to get the smell out but ended up throwing it away and buying another one. Very dissatisfied customer 
 Who is her editor?  The main character self-analyzes to the point of nausea. We got it. We do not need the author to explain to us what she is trying to say.  I felt, as the reader, that the author did not trust me to "get" her own work. It would have been a much better novel had she given her readers more credit. Not to mention, if she grew up in a cold family, with no experiences to open up her sexuality and sensuality, I did not buy that one boyfriend would all of a sudden be a panacea to a lifetime of suppression. 
 I am unhappy with this product. My newborn baby is 22" long and weighs 7 pounds. I purchased this item after speaking to the rep about size. I've found that my son can easily get his legs out of the bottom pouch through the opening. I think that if there was a longer strip of velcro instead of the short square, this would be prevented. He also can get his arms out of the top. If the velcro strip could be larger, going more toward the back and side of the product, this would not happen. Maybe my son is more narrow at the top than some children and this is not a problem for many, but I think this would make the product more useable, one size fits all. Also, he is long, and the small size was too cramped. I'm assuming the next size up would have been too wide for him and therefore making it impossible for his arms to stay inside - which is happening anyway. I like the product idea and the fabric and construction,(which is why I gave it 2 stars) but this product did not work for me. I have recently purchased The First Years swaddle blanket, but have issues with that one as well. I am currently searching for one to fit. 
 I bought this for our 3yo son who loves heavy equipment and digging in the dirt. This is a cool toy as far as being a pretty good replica of a real one but it does not work well in dirt or sand. Fine sediment gets caught in tracks and after a short amount of time, the tracks quit turning. Then the handles on the arm do not move the bucket well. My son has since ripped off the tracks and does not do any digging with it but still enjoys pushing it around. Don't buy this if you want your kid to actually dig dirt, it would be good inside toy or outside but away from dirt or sand. But, I think it was intended for playing in these areas, so the rig is not that well designed. 
 I am a beginner to real estate trying to understand pros and cons of real estate investment. I wanted a book which would explain me step by step on how I can start in a small way and grow big. This books starts big and talks about $2 million dollar investments. I do not want to take such a big step to begin my real estate investments. I would recommend reading 'How to Succeed and Make Money with your first rental house' for beginners in this business.  This book is not worth reading even once 
 I too got the dinosaur pillow! And laughed and laughed! I don't know whether to give it as a gag gift or not...  The trouble is that I really needed it for my neck...  Do NOT buy this particular pillow if you want the small, regular sized one. 
 Although I enjoyed the book for casual reading, it was very short on both pictures and specific plant care info. The authors seem to enjoy commenting on the plants that they have included but 'Passalong Plants' is not for you  if you are looking for technical information.  I wanted it to tell me  specifically how to divide, the best time to harvest passalong plants and  give good drawings/photos of the plants listed.   One of the more  disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon 
 first, I didn't break a sweat, and I would consider myself an intermediate in the aerobic area.  second, the music is not music.  it's someone with a synthesizer hammering out a lame "latin-esqe" beat.  I was looking good some fun and inspiring latin music and well this is NOT it. It is sooooo cheesy.  This dvd *might* be good for the VERY early beginner or someone who's trying to learn english as a second language (the dvd is bilingual).  Other than that, I can't see much use 
 This overwrought tripe is the cinematic equivalent to a dead fish.  It doesn't work as good trash or as high camp.  Edward Dmytryk directs Harold Robbins' source material with a lead foot.  George Peppard made a larger artistic contribution when he was on "The A-Team".  Alan Ladd, who had the misfortune to have this as his last film credit, essentially sleepwalks through this picture.  It's equally unfortunate that talented actors like Carroll Baker, Elizabeth Ashley, and Martin Balsam are associated with this swill.  Heck, I even feel bad for former boxing champ Archie Moore in his having to play the thankless role of houseboy.  The film's lone redeeming quality are the costume designs by Edith Head(the women's lingeree in particular).  If you must waste 150 minutes of your time it's better spent watching paint dry or grass grow 
 The description of this book should have said something about what size rice cooker all the recipes are for.  Once I started reading the book, I discovered all the recipes are made for an 8-10 cup cooker.  I would not have purchased the book if I had known this.  I bought a 3-cup cooker when I bought this book, and I can't figure out how to scale down the recipes to fit in my cooker.  So, the book is basically useless to me.  
 As much fun as sitting in your accountant's office with your lap full of tax receipts. Of course, there are worse things in life, but please, remind me of what they are. Better yet, don't remind me! 
 Could have been better written, better acted, better photographed. Way too many flashbacks.  This whole thing is kind of a mess, really. Lacks cohesiveness.  Premise is interesting enough and a truly gifted director might have made a great film out of it.  The guy who directed this is no Akira Kurosawa, that's for sure 
 I have read many bad books, but this one has the distinction of being the worst ever. It's disconcerting to see with what an impudence the authors pretend to write scientifically and at the same time present the reader with a hurredly-written stuff which looks like those school papers jumbled together late on Sunday. There isn't the least effort to deceive the reader as to the real aim of the book: to fatten the authors' bank account. The comments are such that a twelve-year old would be ashamed to make; the "science" is a downright sham; the "test" developed by the authors, and called MSCEIT, is in truth a DECEIT; and the authors are not so intelligent if they think anyone who read such a thing will ever buy another book by them. I leave the readers this last piece of advice: if you want to write an Emotionally Inflamed Review, then buy this book. Below there are a good many samples of the kind of thing you will soon be writing - and posting here. 
 I purchased this case to store my DVDs along with the inner and outer liner notes.  Unfortunately, the sleeves are only large enough to hold in the inner notes.  Since most of my DVDs only had the outer liner notes, this case was pretty useless.  In general, the design of the product left much to be desired.  If by "XTREME" it means big and bulky, then the description is right on 
 First of all - even though most of my friends hate them - I must admit that I do enjoy watching some good horror flicks. My DVD collection is also primarily concentrating on this genre. Besides classics, such as "Psycho", "The Haunting (original)", "Rosemary's Baby", "The Exorcist", "The Omen (original)", "The Shining", "The Changeling", "Halloween", "Alien" and "The Evil Dead". I also enjoy more recent flicks, such as "The 6th Sense", "The Others", "The Ring (US version)", "The Grudge (US version)" "The Descent", "Dawn Of The Dead (Remake)" and "TCM 2003 Remake". The Problem with "The Beginning" is, that  A. the viewer knows that nobody will survive this massacre the second the movie starts. Which leads to the fact that no hero can be found in this movie! B. Nobody gets to know why Leatherface turned out this way. Damn, they could've atleast shown some flashbacks or a decent intro as e.g.in "House Of Wax". C. There is waaaay too much unnecessary gore and therefore lack of true suspense. These facts, especially the last, make this movie a over the top gorefest in the same league as "Wolf Creek", "High Tension", "Hostel" and "Saw (Sequels)". As one re-viewer stated. Horror movies should entertain by giving the viewer bonechilling suspense and a few good scares. This movie sadly couldn't succeed, due to unnecessary gore, splatter and blood. I don't need that 
 My daughter is watching the DVD right now, she's interested but I don't think it will teach her anything. The potty looks nothing like any of the potty's out there in stores. The DVD quality is lousy, keeps flickering. The cartoon is brief and the little girl does it all in one sitting! ya, right.  I think she only likes the video because of the babies.  Cute song, they should really update this video.  I agree with the other parents about how they should have shown a baby pulling down their pants to use the potty, kids aren't usually running around the house butt naked all day! And the close up of the bum hole is pretty un-necessary too 
 I USUALLY LIKE REICH'S BOOKS BUT HIS ONE WAS A WASHOUT.  IS EVERYONE GETTING ON THE DIVINCI BANDWAGON?? DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO FINISH IT 
 This book is not a serious or scholarly piece of work, and I recommend that you not waste your time reading it.  It begins with a description of the life of Mohammed, the origins and spread of Islam, and the creation of various Islamic sects.  This is probably the best part of the book, but it is still very poor.  For example, Schwartz never really explains even the basic distinction between Shi'a and Sunni Islam.  And Schwartz's overall goals badly tarnish his discussion:  He wants to portray traditional Islam as being perfectly pluralist, tolerant, and peace-loving, so as to contrast it with hate-filled, intolerant, and violent Wahhabism.  As a result, his description of the Ottoman Empire (representing Schwartz's traditional Islam) is completely uncritical and consequently not credible.  For instance, he never even mentions the Ottomans' barbaric and murderous treatment of Armenians and Kurds, to name just two salient examples.  The rest of the book follows a similar pattern:  There are Muslims Schwartz likes (especially Sufis), and there are Muslims he hates (Wahhabis, plus others who are not Wahhabis but whom Schwartz describes as "Wahhabized," though he never explains what  that's supposed to mean).  The "good" Muslims can do no wrong, and the "bad" Muslims are behind just about every act of terrorism committed anywhere on the globe.  I know this sounds like it must be a charicature of the book, but it's not.  Rather, Schwartz's book is itself a charicature of the complexity of contemporary international affairs.  An example will illustrate Schwartz's appalling sloppiness with evidence.  On pages 217-218, he claims that a "manifesto" written by Osama bin Laden proves that Saddam Hussein is connected with bin Laden and Al Qaeda.  I found this surprising, because there is, to my knowledge, no proven link between them whatsoever (and I have followed this issue very closely).  In fact, it is well known that bin Laden has always hated Hussein and secular rulers like him, that bin Laden had called for Hussein's overthrow, that Hussein hated bin Laden and had brutally repressed Islamic fundamentalists like him, etc.  (See, for example, the analysis of this issue in a report by the Carnegie Endownment for International Peace).  So I was very curious to see what evidence Schwartz had found in bin Laden's "manifesto" to support his conclusion that, in spite of all that, Hussein and bin Laden were allies.  Here is Schwartz's evidence:  In his "manifesto," bin Laden (1) called for an end to the UN sanctions on Iraq, (2) lamented the destruction inflicted on Iraq in the first Gulf War, and (3) also lamented the deaths of Iraqi children that were caused by the UN santions.  I'm not kidding--that is the sum total of Schwartz's "proof" that Hussein was an ally of bin Laden and Al Qaeda in their global terror campaign.  It's absurd.  The book does contain one interesting thesis:  Schwartz claims that for most Americans, the face of violent and dangerous Islamic extremism is Ayatolla Khomeini and the Iranian revolution, while Americans have regarded Saudi Islam as "moderate" because the Saudis are US allies.  Schwartz plausibly argues that the reverse is true:  Saudi Islam (Wahhabism) is much more dangerous because of its support for a "holy war" without borders, while the Islamic revolution in Iran was really about liberating the Shi'a of Iran from oppression under the Shah, not about waging a larger war beyond Iran (although Schwartz does acknowledge Iranian support for certain Palestinian militant groups).  The thesis is interesting and possibly true.  But that one interesting point certainly doesn't make this dreadful book worth reading.  If you are looking for an introduction to Islam, or for insightful and well-reasoned discussion of world affairs, please look elsewhere 
 This is an ok book for TIPS here and there, but really lame in every other way. My favorite silly piece of advice is when he says to go ahead and rub perfume on your machine to make it smell pretty. Sewing temperment? Insulting, and a waste of paper. I really tried to like the book. 
 Its ok.  Of course if you take a philosophy class in todays secular universities, you will read 20 things by hume and other atheists and not much pro theism.  His work is ok, but I actually used it as part of a proof that God does exist 
 Please don't read this one for you first Kellerman, Alex Delaware book.  It falls far short of Kellerman's past Delaware stories.  Too many characters and the wrap up of the murders just doesn't cut it for me.  When Kellerman starts in on the African genocide, the book's rhythm takes a 180 and fizzles out from there to the end 
 I picked up this book after seeing some good reviews about it. The whole book is about "Strategic Reflection Point". I was disappointed that Andy Grove didn't try to explain SRP in a more concrete manner. After finishing the book, I still have very vague & abstract knowledge on SRP. Nevertheless, Andy Grove is still one of the best CEOs I admired 
 This book's cover reads "...penetrates the minds and motives of the most terrifying serial killers." In some places it lives up to this theme but for the most part it doesn't. This book is 400+ pages long and over 200 are spent covering the life story of one victim and the aftermath her family faced along with the killer's trail. The story is very uneventful and drawn out. The rest of the book reads at a similar pace. The author has written many books on the subject of the criminal mind and at this point I think he's spread himself thin 
 I was stuck with a bad copy and nothing has been done about it as of yet. 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 The first few reviews are too harsh,I was given this as a gift so I am not as pissed off at the money. I give it two stars could have been three but for the fact that the hero's are way too perfect and they are dull- but it was not a book I expected much from anyway.  The plot also gets way to over the top.  I mean is there any plane or helicopter they cannot learn to fly in a weekend? Hero's invited to the summit by the President! They escape four attempts to kill them before they even get to China! Also hero knew the guy was Chinese just by looking at him for a less than a minute, how many white folks can tell difference among non whites? Why are all the Chinese Americans bad guys as well?   The novel is way to heavy with anit Chinese comments, has lot of what are just rants. See the other points in the publisher weekly review, but after considering them you may want to read the book, if you want to consider what we do if we and china butt heads, but have low expectation and know that in this world the good guys always win. Do not expect much and look for used copy, I paln to look to see if any of his other books get any better reviews before I cut him off. 
 I was really excited about this book before I opened it.  I was very disappointed to see that it really only covers larger houses which already have space available.  All the pictures show rooms with high to very high ceilings, entrance ways, and alot of open space.  Unfortunately, I think, that the average house is much smaller, with less room to work with & lower ceilings, not every place has utility rooms, verandas or entrance ways to utilize.  Even the bathrooms were larger than most I've seen.  Also, many houses do not even have very much extra wall space due to small room dimensions, windows, doorways & possibly a fireplace.  Try to work around that - that's what I was expecting to see, I guess, more variety in the types of homes.  If you do get this book, be prepared to renovate 
 I found this to be yet another boring contemporary novel. It ranks right along with Aloft and The Corrections as yuppie-esque and uninteresting. There was nothing about any of the characters that caused me to care about them at all. Deborah, the rabbi, seemed irresponsible in how she approached her faith. I'm sorry I spent the money to download from audible. (The reader drove me nuts. Her voice is absolutely annoying.).  
 I am stunned that a book like "Lightning" would sell even one copy.  Mine was given to me, but should have been tossed in the trash instead.  I cannot begin to talk about what is wrong with this book because there is nothing right. Worthless!!!!and pathetic and beyond.  For heaven sake if you are really of fan of Steel's (I find that hard to believe) than check it out of the library, do not waste a dime on this trash. "Lightning" discredits all women and is a sham.  It does not deserve even one star 
 I just purchased a glass top stove and bought this because of the protective bottom. However, after using it several times, I would choose a different grill because of the following reasons: #1 The spatter mess - there is virutally no way to prevent splatter when using this pan creating an unneccessary amount of post-cooking clean-up. #2 There is no option of purchasing a lid #3 The pan itself has an odd rectangular shape that does not fit on one burner or two for that matter. Thus, somewhere while cooking you have a cool spot 
 Someone gave me this book and told me how thrilling it was. Halfway through, I find myself still reading it mostly to laugh at the horrible writing and melodromatic style. It's a little depressing to think that millions of readers have made this guy rich and famous on such awful writing. It's good for me to pick up a book like this now and then to be reminded that by avoiding the most popular authors, I'm not missing much. 
 The monologues are intended to be delivered to a live audience. A book simply cannot give the same experience of support and shared understanding. The monologues are a series of snippets intended to raise issues of female anatomy, sexuality, and violence against women. Though ranging from humorous to disconcerting, the monologues are ultimately unsatisfying.  The author, previously a lawyer, seems to think that knowledge of vaginas is a suppressed topic, which has wide consequences. To get past inhibitions, the monologues encourage self-examination and considering what a vagina would wear, say, and smell like. She includes several sexual episodes in which attention to vaginas seems to be emphasized. The monologues on female genital mutilation and ethnic rape are disturbing.   It's really pretty difficult to take this book seriously. One minute one is reading about clothing for a vagina, and the consequences of ethnic rape the next. One topic is silly; the other screams for thorough treatment. It is highly debatable that the topic of vaginal ignorance will lead to understanding social and political systems that permit violence against women.  There is no attempt to address the overall state of sexual knowledge and sexual social conventions in the greater society. If vaginal ignorance is an issue, it can only be the tip of the iceberg.   A person would have to be awfully suppressed or ignorant to be unaware of the factual information in the book. The humor is insufficient to carry the book. The monologues are so brief that the book is filled by an exaggerated forward which discusses the importance of vaginas in history and by a call for participation on college campuses of V-Day, celebrations based on the monologues. This book will appeal to the faithful, and few others.  
 Oprah, dear one, WHY?  Give me Chekhov, Wharton, Plath, Dickens, Poe, but Faulkner?  I appreciate the online assistance at Oprah.com and the Monday night lecture series to aid in understanding the atrocious grammer and quasi-English, but...the revelations to which it all leads isn't worth the pain and suffering of reading Faulkner.    Did this author have an LSD addicition, because let's face it...he "ain't right! 
 I really have to wonder why the MegaTokyo series is so popular.  I think it's popular because a large portion of the non-japanese anime/manga fans have a major obsession with Japan. Like the type of obession where they don't know much about Japan but they love absolutely everything from it and want to move there.. Without actually visiting and/or knowing that Japan has it's problems just like everywhere else. They think it's all just anime goodness and they won't have to deal with the real-life crap like you do in their own country (which is obviously untrue). This is really the only explanation I have for this comic being popular (and published of all things).   This book (and the rest of the comics online or otherwise) isn't very well drawn. The designs, stories and situations are all lifted from other (better) series before it.   Most of the story is about a guy (The author supposedly) who ends up in Japan, blows all his money, moves into his japanese friend's house without really asking and then starts driving his friend into poverty. Throw in some girls, destruction and overall idiocy and you've got Megatokyo.   This is the most cliched, boring and overrated series I've ever read by anyone, japanese and otherwise.  If you want something that's actually funny, well-drawn, with good plots, good pacing and is not boring...look elsewhere, PLEASE. 
 I can't stand this movie, it's one of the worset.   The acting is horrible, it's dark, gloomy, and so boring. It's fun to watch and make fun of it, but thats about all. I do not recommend it, I would give it zero stars if it was possible.   The child actress "mary" and then the older grown up "mary" actress isn't suitable, she doesn't even look like she could have been the same person or type, how awful! Watch another version, this one is a waste of time and money! 
 Great cover, enticing premise. I couldn't wait to read this book...BUT... Every one-star review before mine lays my feelings out perfectly. Let me add a couple more. Frannie grows up, decides to live with a man and writes home to tell her mother what she's going to do. What does her mother say? That's nice, dear. I trust you to make the right decision. Oh please!!! This is the 19th century after all! Then for good measure let's throw this one into the mix. After the indomitable Una shows understanding and makes decisions that earn her the admiration and accolades of every living person, famous or not, that she comes into contact with...she decides to buy into an oil well to help a friend even though everyone agrees that this is throwing money down the rat hole. An oil well! You must be kidding! Of course, she eventually recoups her money plus a bunch.  I could go on and on. I finished every page of this book although I must say I skimmed through the last 100 pages. When I finished and my husband asked how it was, the only way I could think to describe it was SILLY 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 I have read and enjoyed many Cussler books, and though this one was mildly entertaining it was way out there as far the plot goes. If you haven't read Cussler before don't let this be your first, there are many more that are much better 
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 Henri-Georges Clouzot's "Diabolique" is a film that falls short of its potential.  Its rather routine resolution undermines its brilliant premise, suffocating atmosphere, and top-notch acting.     Christina Delasalle (Vera Clouzot) and Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret) conspire to murder Michel Delasalle (Paul Meurisse), the director of a boarding school.  Christina is Michel's wife and Nicole is his mistress.  Both are frequent victims of his abusive nature.  The two women carry out their plan perfectly but Michel's body disappears soon after they dispose of it.  Even more troubling to Christina and Nicole is that subsequent developments suggest that the murdered man might still be alive.     "Diabolique" is graced with three outstanding performances.  Meurisse is effectively slimy as the subject of the murderers' ire while Clouzot and Signoret are superb as the oddly-matched killers.  The film also does a wonderful job of keeping the viewer in suspense once Michel's body disappears.  However, the payoff at the end is not worth all the time the viewer has invested in the film.  The ending is not clever, shocking, or surprising.  It is just plain disappointing.  Too put it simply, "Diabolique" is one of those films that runs out of gas before it crosses the finish line.   
 Read my initial review below which was on July 27.  On August 11, Kensington told me that they do not know when the password registration process will be working, and they strongly urged me to send the product back for a refund.    On July 27 I wrote: This should be a great item at a great price.  And as far as I can tell, it works fine.  Kensington has some serious technical problems, however.   The encryption installs and becomes fully-functional before you can register your USB key and password.  Registration is essential in case you lose the key or forget your password.  This is a BIG problem, because as of July 26, 2006,  Kensington's registration utility was down and not expected to be working until 6-10 days(current estimate).  Worse, the message I got when attempting to register my key the first two days was "Authentication Failed" which told me nothing.  Even worse, their overseas technical support person did not know about the problem. So he also thought I had a defective key, and we wasted a lot of time discussing replacement and timing (I'm about to leave on a trip and really wanted this protection for the trip).  When I finally realized that I would not receive a new key before I left, I asked whether I should uninstall the product or whether I could register the key verbally in case the key was lost on the trip (I figured the answer was no but I was getting desperate).  He went away for a long time, then he reported that he would have to call me back (that took 40 minutes) and finally he reported that probably my key was fine, it's the registration that was offline.  And no, there is no other way to register - that's part of the security.  So the encryption is in place, the laptop boots and runs fine, but I have two days to decide whether to risk taking my laptop and losing the physical key, which means I would have to wipe my hard drive, or risk uninstalling the encryption and having the laptop stolen, in which case I still lose all my data AND sensitive data is exposed.  The laptop will be at risk in hotel rooms, and the key will be at risk on my person as I will be swimming and snorkeling. Kensington claims the thing is waterproof - maybe I'll just buy one of those little waterproof capsules and keep it around my neck.  
 I was forced to read this book because of a teacher of mine, for a topic at the university. She came to the classroom with this book, as if it were the ultimate guide on teaching. First of all, I thought it's not a topic for the kind of subject we were having/discussing in the classroom. Secondly, the things the authors wrote are so obvious, at least for some persons, that all I can say is that I really had a very good time reading it as a comic book, nothing else. I laughed very much with all the explanations a teacher would give to a 7 or 9 year-old pupil, because he touched her on the arm. It was a lecture, not a simple explanation! Clearly we have to be polite, encouraging and nice towards the students. But this book really exagerates some points in such a foolish way, that I could only laugh. I never had problems with students in my classes, I always tried to encourage them to like the subjects; I am sure they learned many things, as well as I learned from them, too. This book was just a waste of time. The worst thing is that the teacher I am talking about, the one who came to the classroom telling how wonderful the book is, doesn't practice what the book preaches! She is hated at the university and never behaves as the book says to. How is it possible? She didn't learn anything from it???  Maybe it's good for people who are starting a teaching career - then I would say read it, but even though I would be very cautious. But being recommended by someone who does exactly the contrary than the book states, I could imagine it wouldn't really be that good. 
 Purchased thinking it was gold-plated as advertised but actually is not.  Quite noisy - settled for a Monster Stereo (Male-to-Male) cable instead 
 If "Havoc" was Anne Hathaway's "all grown-up" vehicle, she needs to check the engine.  Hathaway heads up a cast of almost starlets such as Bijou Phillips and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in this drivel.  Hathaway and her friends, the "PLC" as they call themselves, are products of upper-class Palisades in California.  Bored with their seemingly bland lives, they adopt the "gangsta" mentality of the rappers they listen to and idolize.  In truth, they're nothing but a bunch of unlikeable, snot-nosed posers.  We've all encountered this type before.  You see them at the mall wearing the most expensive "Rocca" wear and and "FUBU" even though they have no clue as to who or what they are actually idolizing.  They think that they have no identity of their own, so they latch on to the nearest cultural group that they can find in hopes to be something that they are not and never will be.  In this tale, Hathaway's group has a run-in with a Latino gang.  Drawn to these outlaws, Hathaway and a few of her female friends join the gang for an all-night party.  Hathaway then returns with one of her friends (Bijou Phillips), and the two take the downward  spiral into supposed gang life.  In the end, however, something happens to them when they decide to actually join the gang.  Their actions cause a number of things to occur.  The results of those actions are status quo for their social status.  Although the film is pulled down by a lot of over-acting (Gordon-Levitt seems to have channeled Jamie Kennedy's "Malibu's Most Wanted" character, B-Rad), the real deal killer is the actions of the supposed street-tough Latino gang headed up by Freddy Rodriguez.  First of all, I'd think that a real gang would have taken out the "PLC" without flinching.  Secondly, had four "innocent" little girls actually made it into the gang's party, I'd think that they would have ended up either raped and dead or strung out on some sort of illegal substance.  Instead, Rodriguez backs off on the posers of the "PLC" and seemingly falls for Hathaway's character enough to let her and her friends live out their fantasies of being in a real gang.  Full of characters that warrant no sympathy and an overly nice street gang who allows little girls to live out a lie, "Havoc" is a dud.  Unbelievable, uneventful and definitely a rental 
 I read this book wanting to comprehend how anti-Semitism first originated, flourished, and then culminated in the Holocaust with Christianity as part and parcel of the whole process. Instead, I got countless examples of this ancient hatred and how it manifested itself in the past and present time. I guess this approach was fine for someone who needed to be convinced of the existence of anti-Semitism. But, this approach didn't really help me to better understand the cause and reason behind the subject matter 
 After the book Ms. Campbell did for Beadwork on beaded beads I expected this to be more and BETTER.  Instead it's mostly just a collection of project classes taught to beginners.  The only artistic offering in the whole book is the Industrial Strength Bead by Ingrid Bloch made from hex nuts from the hardware store.  The remainder of the projects is a big yawn. You'd never be caught dead in a necklace of Pumpkin beads or Crisscross beads.  I taught 8-year old Girl Scouts how to make Sea Anemone beads years ago!!  You've seen them all before.  The gallery pieces are gorgeous and some are even made by the contributors to the book.  If they can do this high quality work, why include the insipid baby sample projects?  Why can't more quality books be written like the one by Valerie Hector?  There is a glut of junk project books on the market and this is just another one. Save your money or else buy the Beadwork book on beaded beads and Valerie Hector's book. PS  Since Diane Fitzgerald has several beads in this book her 5 star rating is hardly objective.  While her designs have not been published before they are just variations of the ones delineated in Valerie Hector's book. Even with her bias for the book she describes the projects as "tiny".  Maybe these project books should be marked "baby" when their projects are so basic and pedestrian.    
 I bought this trike because of the extended handle.  My son is 2 and I knew it would be a while before he learned to pedal, but I haven't been able to use the handle sucessfully yet!  There is an akward slot that you must put the handle in that doesn't give you the support to push (or assist) a toddler.  So  I have ended up doing what I didn't want to do (or pay $80 to do) that is bend down and push him around 
 seriously bad...she sounds more like a motivational speaker for [...] women than she does a comic. I watched this last night high-as-a-kite and did not laugh at a single thing...that's never happened before. Had I been sober I wouldnt of watched it at all. TERRIBLE 
 I recently purchased the Receptor HD. Out of the box it was a fairly complex set-up. The antennas are totally inadequate. I am 10 miles across water from Seattle and neither antenna can pick up more than half the HD stations there. I have an Accurian from Radio Shack and it picks all the stations up with no difficulty using the same antenna(s) in the same place. And it cost 1/2 as much. The Receptor sound is "boomy". If you walk away from it, all you can hear is muffled booming. After 5 days, the radio quit entirely. Boston Acoustics was non-responsive to emails and has only a toll number with long waits to speak to anyone. They say they will repair it...but I must wait for an RA...and shipping is at my expense. Not a lot of confidence in their products! Listen and compare before you buy. The Accurian only lacks an input for external devices..and it sounds more balanced 
 I could sum up this book very quickly:  1) Trust in God for everything  2) Read the Bible  3) Attend church  4) Ask your husband, church, other Christians for help  The book is full of fluffy ideas like: "We need to know ourselves the way God knows us" "Find a Christian counselor" and advice for single mothers to simply attend church if seeking help.  The book primarily revolves around the Bible and its interpretation of parenting. Why not cut out the middle-man and just read this "wonderful book?" It's not like the Bible is a work in progress.   This book is more about proselytizing and keeping Evangelicals reading "inspired" books rather than competing viewpoints. And with America being one of the most pure Christian nations in the world ( US is more Christian than India is Hindu and Israel is Jewish ). Anything published by Zondervan should be looked at skeptically.   I also dislike how males are stilled deemed unworthy parents in the Christian community. They can assist and help , but cannot be considered primary parents. But given this books lack of true substance, I doubt it would have made any difference 
 This is definitely NOT one of my favorite books about stocks.  The title of the book is a little deceiving, the author talks a lot about option instead of stocks and half the book is about stock splits.  Chapters 1-4 are about general info, such as you must buy and sell to make money, don't hold for a long time. You must research the stock before purchase, EPS must increase every year.  I didn't find anything in those chapters that I didn't already know.   Chapters 5-10 is all about stock splits and when to purchase the stock as well as when to sell. Once again, the author talks about the obvious; buy when you hear that stock is splitting and sell after the split before the after split dip.    Chapter 11 gets into more advanced trading techniques, the bull put spread.  This is not something that I use or will use in my trading.   Chapter 12 is the concluding chapter  
 I received this book to review for a zine I write for, and it was so bad i told the publisher it wasn't worth reviewing. pierce was grandiose at best and just plain crazy at the end, and it really shows here in the jumbled structure and absolute inanity of much of what is included. I was pretty grossed out by his attitude toward women, too. His obsession about all things Japanese was also really tedious. And I LIKED the Gun Club. Reading this book made me think of the book & movie "Being There", in which the main character speaks only in slogans he's heard from television, and those who meet him think he's a genius. What were you thinking, Henry 
 I picked up this book because I didn't think the LOST novels were anything more than a rumor, and didn't realize "Endangered Species" was the first one.  At any rate, "Secret Identity" is a big time waster if you're a rabid LOST fan looking for an interesting show based book.  Dexter Cross essentially is nothing short of an annoying character that has no interesting back story, and most of the time on the island is devoted to him obsessively mulling over whether he should take a look in the fuselage for Daisy or not or passing out from dehydration, while his backstory is nothing more than a drawn out story of how he lied to his girlfriend of what he really was.  Big deal.  You have no emotional attachment to the character, and worse yet, the writer forgets to actually describe him!  I kept picturing a 30 something year old character that was more akin to looking like Artz than the young man who "didn't quite look like Boone and was probably a little younger".  Worse yet, the writer was overly descriptive to the point of exhaustion; I don't need to know precisely all the graphical designs on the box for the grills that fell on his cranky aunt.  This woman needs to stop writing, because she obviously can't 
 As a strong proponent of attachment parenting and a rather radical unschooler, this book was a BIG disappointment!!! I bought this book after reading the reviews and wish I hadn't paid more than $1 for it. While the title "The Unprocessed Child" accurately describes Laurie's upbringing, this book shouldn't be grouped with other unschooling literature. The author, while cherishing the close bond she has with her daughter, reminds me of the mother in "Love You Forever" who sneaks across town and climbs into her grown son's room at night to spend time with him--sweet but a bit creepy. The fact that she admits that she even went to college at the same time as her daughter so she could spend more time with Laurie pretty much says it all. The mother clearly has her own issues that I hope she allows herself to work through and heal from now that she's not spending 24/7 with her only child. We have been unschooling each of our four children since birth --challenging temperments and all--and I feel very privileged to spend so much time with them as they discover how exciting it is to decode and discover the world around them. If you want to read a GOOD book about unschooling without unsupported platitudes and preaching in almost every chapter, I would recommend "Homeschooling our Children, Unschooling Ourselves". Those authors offer more balance and eloquence than Ms. Fitzenreiter. 
 Erskine Caldwell while apparently wrote during a different time, apparently did nothing to promote anything other than stereotypes of the rural south.  I myself am from a small rural town in Arkansas and grew up with stories my grandparents told of their experiences during the great depression.  They were poor and lived by subsistence farming but they were proud and spoke with a sense of accomplishment of their home life.  While their education and opportunities may have been limited it seemed to make them appreciate what they did have later.  I was surprised to find out that Caldwell had actually lived in the South following my reading the book because he didn't seem to have anything pleasant to say about it at all.  All regions of the country do have impoverished persons who have no ambition to improve themselves nor realize the situation that they're in but this I felt was an unfair take on what was not an easy time for anyone in America.    If you like southern literature, I would much more highly recommend a Willie Morris book, Cold Sassy Tree by Olive Ann Burns, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, maybe one of Shelby Foote's works of fiction, or Eudora Welty amongst others.  In those stories, poverty and racism which are issues in the south are evident but portrayed in a more fair and consistent light.  I will admit in closing that I was interested in the story and finished the book fairly quickly but I felt the content was not all that impressive and only served to deepen stereotypes and preordained views that wrongly exist about the South 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 Boy do I feel like a sucker, this is likely the most useless, "living the art life" type of book I have ever read. Mr. Dorrell uses this book mainly as a platform for his ego-rich, self serving anecdotes and know it all type of advise and opinions. Have you ever been to a party with one guy who just "knows" everything and can not wait for an opportunity to tell you his opinion on anything ... that is how this book reads. It was irritating to say the least. If you have any art degree or have been to art school or have ever done anything art related at all, you already know whatever practical advice you can squeeze out of this book.   If you want good inspirational books on "living the artist life" pick up Art & Fear by David Bayles and Ted Orland (amazing book), The Shape of Content by Ben Shahn or The Art Spirit by Robert Henri. If you want to run an art business, it sounds cheesy but pick up How to Start a Home Based Crafts Business by Kenn Oberrecht, very practical and no-nonsense - not just for crafts. 
 Run, don't walk, away from this book. I regret purchasing it for my daughter, and it is now on it's way back to Amazon. I was shocked to read that Madeline's neighbor uses the gift of a tool set to build a guillotine in his backyard that he uses for chopping the heads off of chickens. Are we really so desensitized to violence in this culture that this is considered acceptable? I can't believe that this book is considered a classic. What a poor choice for any child 
 Bryson is certainly witty. But any pleasure in the book was ruined by the author's snotty and obnoxious tone. I can not understand why the author thinks he is better than the people everywhere he visits; there is certainly no objective evidence in support of his inflated self-image. What a whining, immature, mean jerk. And by the way, there's a fair sprinkling of gutter language in the book. 
 Thank God for libraries.  If I had paid money for this book I'd be returning it for a refund.  As a hiking guide this book is a dismal failure.  There are no maps of either road directions to the trailheads or of the hikes themselves.  Driving and hiking directions are vague and contain several errors.  Descriptions of the hikes seldom top 30 words and contain little useful or interesting information.  I seriously doubt the authors have been on most of these hikes.    Describing this as a hiking guide is dishonest.  As a previous reviewer stated, it is a political manifesto.  If you go for that sort of thing, you may like the book.  If you're looking for a hiking book get one of the Falcon guides or one o the excellent books by William L. Sullivan (100 hikes in Eastern Oregon, 100 Hikes in the Central Oregon Cascades, 100 Hikes in Southern Oregon, etc.). 
 This product alone does NONE of the things listed in the descrption BY ITSELF. You must still buy other software to use it. When I questioned them about why they listed it as doing all these things, which it doesn't do, they pointed out where it says "may require 3rd party software for various uses". I just didn't know that the definition of 'various' was ALL USES WE HAVE LISTED.   I would rate my experience with this seller as: Dissapointing  At least let my misfortune be a warning to someone out there somewhere.    
 I got both my sons these socks and really liked the performance, thickness, etc. However, it has been only two months and several of my three year olds' socks now have holes in the toes, the heels, and you can see the fabric wearing thin and about to have holes at other places. My 8 month olds' socks are fine, however, he doesn't give them the wear of a three year old. So if you have a baby, these socks are great! If you have a preschooler, very poor choice 
 I've been wanting to see this movie and I finally did on LOGO. I'm just happy I waited untill It came on TV. I though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it. The romance was slim to none. I thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role. Well, I won't say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it. Anyway, I would much rather watch Beautiful Thing, Get Real, All Over the Guy & The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls In love 
 This book should forever remain in print just to illustrate, in black and white, how immoral, calculated, and disgraceful the rightwing element is in America.  Like Mein Kampf before it, this book justifies war as simply another instrument of policy, just another tool among many to implement change.  Of course, all the rationales used in it are false, and the absence of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq lays bare for all to see the arrogance, wrongness, and decadence of this rightwing element.  It is sad that, though we thought we had rid the world of fascism, there are those who, wittingly or otherwise, fall under its spell.  Kristol absolutely has the sticky blood of fallen American troops on his hands, lives lost futiley and vainly for an obscure, unnecessary cause.  There will be no domino chain reaction of democracy in the Middle East, we are not seen as liberators, and Bush, devoid of an exit strategy, continues to bumble his way through the slog of quagmire.  The only thanks we can give to Kristol, et al is the satisfaction of knowing that, in their pursuit to make war just another instrument of policy, they have ensured that America will not be willingly going to war again for a very, very long time 
 I've been a longtime fan of Seagal's movies, but I was greatly disappointed by this film.  First, there were clearly sections where Steven Seagal's voice was done by a different actor who sounds nothing like him. (Clearly done when the film was cut together after the main filming) It was surprising that they could not take the time to get Seagal to do the vocal tracks for those sections.  There were also very few action sequences that demonstrated Seagal's skills with martial arts.  In many ways, this film was more of a slasher flick than an action film. Little action, but lots of bloody corpses lying about.  I enjoyed Black Dawn far more, and feel it was a much better made film 
 Chainfire is, quite literally, the worst book in the history of mankind. Open it up to any random part of the book, and you will most likely find both pages filled with one speech or another by Richard that any decent writer would have put into a page, (and only one such speech!!!) and then continued with the story. however...THIS ENTIRE BOOK is filled with Terry Goodkind's absolutely useless Ayn Rand like drivel delivered in chapter long speeches delivered by the main character Richard. I suppose it is a decent philosophy, but trying to insert this book into the sword of truth series should be a crime. Terry Goodkind deceived every one of his readers, who wanted to read about Richard battling the Imperial Order, into reading something that should only be presented in a philosophy class---and a 7th or 8th grade one at that. It reminds me of having read The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand in my freshman year of high school...and thinking that it was the most horrible waste of paper ever...and Chainfire is an even worse imitation of that book. This book is absolute garbage and currently graces my fireplace in the form of ashes and soot. Don't buy it unless its cheap enough to be worth its weight in firewood.     
 I purchased this item from Target and had to return it to the store.  The wedge comes in 2 pieces of foam, and the foam is inserted into the cover.  The foam isn't the problem, it's the cover.  The zipper goes right down the middle, so it can't be comfortable for the baby to lay with the zipper poking out under their head/neck.  I would recommend the crib wedge that comes in one piece.  If the zipper were on the side, the product would be great 
 This book uses ONE single map on every page to document the movement of various people over time.  However, it does not  designate major landmarks.  It tells of tribes crossing the Danube and the Volga but these rivers are never labeled.  It refers to the Tigris and Euphrates but you need another map to tell you where they are.  When major landmarks are not identified it is hard to understand how this can be called an Atlas.  The history is disjointed and poorly written.  The only reason to buy this book is that you don't have a match with which to burn your money 
 Soy is not necessarily the wonder food that this book purports it to be. Like most things, one should investigate both sides to every story including this one.  For one, the Weston A Price Foundation cautions against using soy. Their research proves that soy should be avoided - contradicting Sears' claims.  As always, use your head 
 Although I found the magazine itself to be interesting and colorful, with a good series of articles on marriage and relationships, I found that customer service was very dissapointing. I missed an issue back in October, and have contacted customer service 3 times to have them resend the issue I missed. It is now March, and I still haven't received my replacement. Just a heads up! 
 Although the book was brand new as stated.  It did not have a cd included  or an acess code for the evolve in the book.  Most sellers include these features when its brand new!  The features are needed to see how an assessment is done on a patient!  The videos and excercises in the cd or evolve put the textbook's ideas into action.  Without the supplement of the cd or evolve it makes understanding the concepts more difficult.  
 This book should have been titled "Resistance is Futile: Reflections of the Borg Queen, Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
    This book follows in line with most conspiracy theories...take some facts, possibly coincidental, string them together and they are hard to disprove.  Ask yourself, why does the author use "may" alot? It seems like that qualifier is in there too too much. Milk may cause cancer? Milk may cure cancer? Ask yourself, why to doctors write books? Maybe they can't practice medicine to earn a living? The one part that really discredited everything was the story of the lab experiment of tooth decay in rats. Rats, similiar to tooth decay susceptibility as humans were given rat chow with pasteurized milk and one group without milk and lo and behold the pasteurized milk fed rats had more cavities, BUT there were no test done on raw milk fed rats......are we not getting the whole story? I gave it two stars only because it can make a person think and has some entertainment value. I am a dairy farmer, drink my own milk.....raw, but have drank pasteurized, both good for the body. I am glad I did not pay new price, but still not worth it 
 I started this novel after reading Erdrich's Love Medicine. While it is clearly not as lyrically written, it is more accessible, and I admired Erdrich's inventiveness as she creates a very unique set of characters. I never finished "Beet Queen", quitting not that far from the end. When Celestine's child turned out to be so impossible, it was the last straw. "Beet Queen" is just too determinedly bleak, to no higher purpose I could discern or discover in reading reviews here. 
 Into The Woods is one of my Sondheim favorites.  Having seen the PBS presentation of this, I am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this DVD is edited.  Rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction, this DVD uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close-ups.  This especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play; the staging.  By forcing the viewer's perspective, this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath.  I am hoping that somebody releases a version that does not presume to edit out the director's vision 
 While Black and Blue does bring to light and make the readers aware of the depths and secrets involved in spousal abuse, it is rather difficult to identify with, like, or even feel anything for the protagonist.    Black and Blue explores the life of an abused woman who has attempted to disappear with her son in order to escape her abuser husband.  First of all, the book seems to me like a Lifetime Movie, almost cheesy if you will.  Half of the things the main character does, you are screaming at her in your head to not do them.  She is almost like the dumb girl in every horror movie, who runs up the stairs instead of out the door.    I found all of the characters in the book seem to have much more depth than the protagonist.  While I was rooting for her, it was because she was the victim, not because I actually liked or understood her.  She seemed weak, in that she really didn't do much of anything to help herself or her situation, either everyone else did everything for her, or things just kind of happened. Yes, it took a lot of guts to make that first phone call that was necessary in order for her to leave her husband, however, that was the only thing she ever really did for herself (pick up the phone).  Everything else was done for her, mostly without her knowledge.  She was doing something that was so hard to do, she should have felt like a strong woman to me, but she didn't not in the least and I attribute my feelings to poor character development and the actions as well as the non-actions of the main character.   One thing that annoyed me was the constant memory descriptions or flashbacks.  While they were integral to the story, they came at the oddest moments.  Sometimes it took you a few seconds to figure out if she was speaking her memory to someone else, if it was actually happening in real time, or it was all in her head.  In the middle of a conversation with someone she would suddenly reel into a 2 or more page memory in her head and then when the memory was over she would go right back into the conversation.  This left me having to go back a few pages to recall what the real-time conversation was even about.    Overall, the basics of the plot were interesting, as were some of the characters in the book.  The book does make one aware of the dangers of often hidden spousal abuse; however, it was not captivating.  I will not buy, recommend or read this book again. 
 What a "piece of work" this was.  Boring, slow, full of highly irrelevant side plots... just a bomb NOT "the bomb" ;).  It took me forever to finish it because I would literally start falling asleep after a few pages and this is something that I very rarely experience.  There are like 5 or 6 parallel stories in this book which none come to any level of satisfactory fruition at the end of the book.  Save your money and more importanly your TIME... skip to something else if you come across this one 
 This movie was ok. I do prefer The Messenger starring Milla Jovovich. Milla is exceptional in that version 
 This CD is the worst "comedy" CD I have ever heard.  Yet the reviews on here mostly claim it was hilarious????  Ok, I've come to the conclusion, the only people writing positive reviews on Amazon MUST be the people trying to sell the junk.  I've seen this guy on some tv shows, and on comedy central, and he's a somewhat funny guy, but it is painful to listen to this CD.  You can feel the awkwardness of the crowd, not knowing if or when to laugh.  And it continues throughout the entire CD.  There don't seem to be any jokes on the CD at all.  It is all disconnected negative rants from a bitter angry human being.  Don't believe me?  Then go ahead and waste your money on this horrible piece of junk, and see for yourself.  Like my review title says, Do NOT read the positive reviews.  Just read the negative ones, and decide how credible they seem.  Then make your decision to buy or not buy 
 I was a little skeptical when a friend insisted on loaning me this novel, even though, as a native Floridian, I find the subject of the state's history quite appealing. Once I started reading, however, the tale of the MacIvey clan did keep my interest and kept me turning the pages. (Yes, I did read them too.) Smith essentially tells the story as a flashback, setting up the reader for the long haul to find out exactly why the action in the opening pages has come about. Clever ploy (if hardly original), and it works well here.  The problems of the book are, alas, significant. Smith uses a lot of dialogue, but his characters sound more like the author's parrots than real flesh-and-blood. People just don't talk this way, not even in the 19th century. (Compare this with, for example, Charles Portis's "True Grit.") The characters are essentially stereotypes, and the main figures are simply flawless salt of the earth.  The original MacIvey family, white southern "crackers" of the late 1800s, apparently has not a prejudiced bone among them when it comes to blacks and Seminoles -- not bloody likely. The book also includes some amateurish editing mistakes.   Smith concentrates his story mainly on the years in which south Florida's cattle industry was developing, from the 1860s through the 1890s. From that point on, the story of the MacIvey clan grows increasingly episodic and hits only a few predictable high points of 20th-century Florida history -- e.g., the 1920s land boom and the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane disaster (the latter described much more memorably in Zora Neale Hurston's "Their Eyes Were Watching God"). Smith seems to want to celebrate the  pioneering spirit of the free-ranging Florida cattlemen of the 1800s while decrying what later generations did in despoiling the state's environment. However romantic the 19th-century cattlemen may appear to some people, I find it hard to think that they were any less responsible for the ultimate ruination of south Florida than the lumbermen, "Big Sugar," or the coastal real estate industry in the 20th century.  For all its flaws, however, anyone wanting an introduction to this era of Florida's history would probably find "A Land Remembered" a fast and relatively painless read. Smith has some good stories to tell. Based on this book, it's too bad he's not more painstaking and imaginative when it comes to the characters that populate those stories.      
 This movies tries to represent a time in the golden age of Hollywood, but they can't represent it. In occassions actors don't know what to do, how to play their characters. Kirsten Dunst play an older when she looks like a teenager, she's a good actress but far to bee the best one, and able to play any character. The story is weak and a bad plot for what it seems something real 
 Hello People wake up How Many times can the same 3 children escape 1 bad guy?!? this Book was horrid! Boring, Boring, Boring, After the 5th book i was snoring and this tops it all its not even the last one!!!!! After 12 books its still not over, my grandchildren will be reading the100th book if he continues like this! (and between me and you, what kind of a person cant recognize a baby in a conciarge outfit)I dont plan to even bother to read the 13th book, i can see lemony saying the series will continue after the book "The end" if there was a 0 star i would give it!! 
 I bought this book because I was looking for some alternatives to PB&J.  Both of my children are now attending peanut-free/tree-nut free schools.  This book has lots of ideas, but too many of them are variations of the peanut butter sandwich.  
 Being a fan of this type of literature, I couldn't wait to watch this.  But I hadn't read the book.  About 15 minutes into it, I couldn't stand the boredom and never finished watching the movie.  However, if you are a fan of the book and a Thomas Hardy fan, it's probably a must for your collection 
 I learned to play chess over 37 years ago but didn't play much after college.  I recently started studying it when friends at work got me back into the game.  I'm sure I'm only in the 800s if was to get a rating. A friend loaned me this book and other than the 10 principles in the first chapter it immediately loses a beginner.  The errors identified in the other reviews are a big clue that this is not a great work.  I had a terrible time trying to follow several of the games on a board and so I gave up.  For a beginner, I have found,  "Discovering Chess Openings" by John Emms to be very good book.  At least I understand what the author is saying and he starts at a level I can grasp and builds from there 
 I don't think most people ask themselves, "I wonder how corn flakes were invented?"  It was hard to get excited about the documentary.  I mean, the Kellogg brothers were not Marilyn Monroe, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., or Pocahontas.  Still, this may be good for history fanatics and fans of camp. This documentary did not avoid Dr. Kellogg's anti-sex campaigns.  They mention his hatred of mastering the domain and advocacy of enemas, though they never mention the term klismatophilia. This documentary is lopsided, focusing on one brother far more than the other.  Like many Biography episodes, this one interviews a biographer and several living relatives of the subject.  I usually think documentaries that have actors dressed in period pieces recreating things are cheesy.  This documentary avoids that tactic, but it did move more slowly because of it.  Seeing one still photo after the next got boring. Many brilliant people make useful statements and stupid statements.  Sigmund Freud and Margaret Mead are other examples.  If you avoid throwing the baby out with the bath water, Dr. Kellogg was quite an interesting person and this documentary becomes worthwhile 
 Atlantis: Milo's Return plays out more like three saturday morning cartoon episodes that they added interconnecting scenes to. It has the poor quality of the average saturday morning toons.   This is not really much of a sequel. They present three seperate, unrelated tales of misadventure that Milo and the gang have to go through. Sure, they are all related to artifacts that were created by the king of Atlantis, but that's about it.   Poorly conceived, blandly presented, and with an ALL NEW VOICE for Milo (they obviously couldn't get Michael J. Fox back for this due to the poor quality), the standard Disney trademark is on this when everything turns out perfectly peaceful in the end.  Kids might enjoy it, but Scooby Doo at its worst is more entertaining 
 Many have seen this movie on TV many times. For a B-movie it is great fun and interesting to watch. No extras on the DVD. I wish they did add something from behind the scenes, etc 
 CRIMSON MOON is about a werewolf who finally meets his match...wait, I mean his 'mate' in a woman with some supernatural abilities of her own.  He's a criminal, but a good one--Werewolf Robin Hood, if you will.  And her father is a target because of her father's indifference to the harmful effects of his business policies on the evironment (wholly unbelivable).  He wants to make her father pay; he also wants his daughter for a wife.  HE is Johnny Marshall also known as Sam Morgan.  SHE is Olivia Woodlock.  Together with this story is a subplot regarding a crazy business competitor of Olivia's father.  Apparently, this very disturbed villain has hatched a scheme to replace Olivia with another woman-whom he has kidnapped, molested and surgically altered against her will (to look like Olivia, of course).  Olivia spurned him, and he wants her all the more.  The story is thin and undeveloped, as are:  the romance, the lead characters, the villain.  The villain and environmental protection burglar/hero business are the weakest part of CRIMSON MOON.  Olivia loses her heart to Sam inside of 30 pages:  "...she couldn't shake the disturbing feeling that he had taken some part of her with him [I think she means her heart]...," though she had met him only moments before and talked with him for a few minutes, showing him some of her father's art collection.  Okaaaaay....  CRIMSON MOON is convoluted and suffers from a lack of depth of intellect or emotion.  If you are into excessive, inessential sex scenes then this flat, tall tale of a story from Rebecca York also known as Ruth Glick will be just the thing.     And if I haven't been clear enough, I have another way of putting it:  I started reading this book two months ago and only got about halfway through.  Last night I tried again (I like to finish books I've paid for...if I can), but I only made it about 10 pages further.  And that took a colossal effort!  If This Book Were Food, I'd Rather Starve Than Clean My Plate. 
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 George Strait can make good music and albums, but the songs he did for his only movie Pure Country sound flat and dull.  Heartland's the only good song. The rest of the album is a wastleland of dull ballads and uptempo country songs that would be better sung at a lost bar in Arizona.  I was a little disturbed that an artist of George's high caliber would record these songs.  Avoid this one at all turns!  
 I agree with Susan Taylor's review.  I have read other books by this author and was excited that he wrote a book for young men about growing up... luckily I read it before giving it to my son because I threw it in the trash when I was finished.  I thought it was an excellent book until I got to the sexual experimentation... Although I still think that Michael's books are great resources, he lost a bit of credibility in my opinion.   
 Dave Barry's Bad Habits has comedy fiction writer Dave Barry trying his hand at the non fiction market.  Although he achieved quality work in this genre with later attempts such Homes and Other Black Holes, this book was clearly just cashing in on the success of his fiction with little effort put in whatsoever.  There's lots of references to Commies which either means Barry was extremely paranoid and brainwashed by his government of the time or he is retelling the same joke over and over again throughout the book, a joke that isn't that funny the first time and is really irritating when repeated and repeated and repeated.   Barry also insists on telling us his personal stories in this book, obviously the publishers had a word in his ear with future non fiction books as these stories are hardly evident in those books but unfortunately they are here and aren't that interesting.  Dave Barry can write some really good stuff, both fiction and non fiction.  Dave Barry's Bad Habits unfortunately is not one of those occasions. 
 I believe this is the second worst book I've ever read, although having not bothered to finish it, it had potential to rank higher on the list.  The concept, the characters, the plot and the writing were so far fetched that it was too difficult to suspend my disbelief long enough tolerate reading it.  I never give up on books; I read them to the end, no matter how much I dislike them.  Leaving a book unread haunts me; throwing out a book is a Cardinal Sin in my mind.  I made an exception in this case and tossed it in my garbage can and felt no guilt.   The writing is poor; there is no eloquence, no wit, no attempt at a remotely believable plot.  The humor is not humorous; it's an attempt at slapstick comedy that falls short of its goal.  It is too obvious, too tiresome, and often just plain bizarre.  The book was recommended by a close friend who enjoys award-winning books; I assumed she'd be on target with this one.  She obviously likes Hiaason's books and find them funny and involving, but simply put,they're not my taste or to my liking.  Find something else to do with your time, something more satisfying and  mentally stimulating than reading this book.  I've never dared to try another of his books since being so annoyed by Lucky You, so I cannot speak for them.  This one might have been an anomaly in his body of work, although I honestly don't know.  But I feel like I wasted my time with this, and to be honest, if I were given a choice between reading this book and snorting dirt, I'd choose the latter.   
 Yeah, so Blanchett's character plants a bomb to kill a drug dealer. Where would an English teacher get a bomb in Italy, in a Boms-R-Us store? And why did not she simply unleash a Godzila on that bad guy? Then she faints and falls in love with a guy who has as much appeal as my supersonic toothbrush. And that's Cate Blanchett for you guys. Rejoice already. Then they shave their heads - a masterful plan to blend with Italian peasantry crowds. Great. Now what do you do when your shaving heads plan thing does not work? Jump on a helicopter and end the movie. I don't know... Sounds kind of stupid. Is it me or the movie 
 I was so excited to get this microphone only to find out that all of the music is POLYPHONIC!!!  The background music sounds like bad elevator music instead of the original background music.  If you just want to tinker with karaoke this is the microphone for you.  if you want to really sing, don't waste your money!! 
 I was going to give this book five stars after I got it out of the library. Then I ordered the book from amazon - to be stunned to see that the last SIX pages, some of the funnier ones, are missing! They are:  "Look at the clock, it's a quarter to two. Goodness gracious, what will we do? Hurry quick it's up to you" and showing the animals cleaning up and running back to their paddocks.  The book makes little sense without these 
 This book is about statistics, regression analysis, and other boring subjects. If you like reading tables of numbers you might like it but since it was written after much numbers research be prepared for the ho-humm. It is one of the few books on this subject I could not finish---I have read over 65 books on the subject 
 Echo & The Bunnymen, are one of those bands (like My Bloody Valentine or Depeche Mode) that everyone tells me I am going to like, but don't. I am a huge fan of a lot of 80's brit-pop (The Smiths, The Cure, Aztec Camera, etc.) but these songs just don't compel me. I will say the guitar playing is excellent and these guys really gel together as a band, but the melodies are not exceptional and the songwriting lackluster. Maybe this is not a good place to start or maybe I am too young (or old) to "get" this band, but I have to be honest: Not impressed.  
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
 I was extremely disappointed by this book.  The title and the write-up on the back cover held the promise of a how-to manual to use your brain to its fullest potential.  The book reads like a superficial mish-mash of philosophy and neurology, with almost no back-up to its major claims and statements about human behavior or the development of societies.  At times it sounds like a new age environmentalist screed, noting that poor use of the brain results in the misuse of natural resources.  I was kept waiting until the final pages of the book for the magical how-to promised at the beginning.  The secret formula for better brain use: be a better person, preferably an environmentalist.  The only information of value is Huther's repeated assertion that your brain physiology will adapt to the way you continually use it, and will reinforce this routine way more and more.  This has been said by other's before (see Edward De Bono, Mechanism of Mind) 
 At 163 pages, "Wildlife" is more of a novella than anything else and about as dry as the scorched Montana landscape.  The biggest problem is not so much the story, but the way the story is told.  In some cases, the impersonal first-person narrator works, as in "The Great Gatsby", but in others like "Wildlife" or "A Prayer for Owen Meaney", the narrator is such a nonentity that they don't add anything to the story and act only as a buffer that prevents the audience from really getting to know the other, more important characters.  The story, if you don't know, is that when narrator Joe's father loses his job as a golf instructor, he goes into the forest to help fight a wildfire.  While he's gone, Joe's mother has a fling with an older local businessman, Warren Miller, but whether this was already going on before Joe finds out is unclear.  When Joe's father returns from the fire, his mother moves out for a while.  And that's it.  In this case Joe (complete with dull name) has no friends, no ambitions, and few (if any) opinions to share.  He's no one I could ever care about, because his only function seems to be as a recording device to report the activities of his parents to us readers.  The parents, as though aware of this, speak in an unnatural way to always indicate to us what they are feeling or thinking.  It's the problem I've had with all of Ford's books, including the Pulitzer-winning "Independence Day".  Some writers are able to write convincing dialogue and others (like Ford) are not.  It's hard to say much about "Wildlife" because there's so little to it.  There's not a lot of action, drama, or passion and the story itself isn't much that we haven't already seen before.  Again, the story told through Joe the buffer keeps us from really learning anything about the characters and that prevents us from feeling sympathetic towards their plight.  It's hard to feel sorry even for poor Joe, because he's so without distinguishing features to his personality.  I've said this before about similar cases of first-person stories using a bland narrator--which always prompts other people to reach for the "Not Helpful" button--and that is that the story would have been more interesting either in first-person focusing on one of the parents or in third-person and focusing on both, so that we weren't so buffered from everything.  What makes Ford's Bascombe novels "The Sportswriter" and "Independence Day" so much better than his other novels is that we learn just about everything about Frank Bascombe and he is the center of all the action of the story, so that even if he is emotionally detached, it's easier to feel sympathetic towards him as a reader.  This can't be said for this dry little book.  If I hadn't bought this book for about as little as you can realistically pay without stealing it and if it were longer, then I would give it 1-star for wasting my time and money.  But I'll give it a bonus star for not wasting either one.  Now go reach for the Not Helpful button, I command you 
 The book felt like hype for Pip Coburn's investments. It contradicts itself in numerous places and its examples are sketchy on details and facts. For instance, cost is rarely even a factor and that's the magic of the "change function", but in chapter 4 it seems to be a significant factor in the failure of Iridium/Globalstar. His hyping of satellite radio was very one sided. He mentioned none of the reasons many investors already consider it a failure- if you want customized music just buy an ipod, the most important 20-30 year old demographic can't afford brand new cars with XM and have a "free music" mentality, and the infrastructure costs with satellites combined with still needing ground antennas makes it uncompetitively expensive. Intel did not give up on MHz increases because customers did not care. They gave up because they are hitting technology limitations as silicon approaches the limits that physics will allow. Salesforce.com is mentioned practically in every chapter as a godsend example of a great company, yet I can easily apply Coburn style methods to counter this enthusiasm. My biggest disappointment was this one sided analysis throughout the whole book 
 As a graduate professor who teaches several course on M&A, I've chosen two other efforts from publisher John Wiley for this year's curriculum over Pat Gaughan's updated version of his old book. Jeffrey Hooke's "Practical Guide to Doing the Deal" covers most of the same material in a more interesting style and "Winning at Mergers & Acquisitions" shows my students how all of this applies to the real world. Mark Clemente & David Greenspan, authors of "Winning at M&A", helped my students to understand the business rationale behind deals and brought to light many of the reasons so many corporate combinations fail. In addition, the juicy chapters on strategy, due diligence and culture and a whole section on integration best practices -- I feel -- will prepare serious readers on the topic and students of business alike for the M&A challenges that actually exist in corporate America today. Case studies and testaments on what works and what doesn't from corporate VPs and CEOs involved in mergers and acquisitions make "Winning at M&A" the core content I've already added to next year's syllabus. As for John Wiley's reprinting of Gaughan's book, they probably should have asked Hooke and Gaughan to collaborate on an updated version rather than publish two versions of the same manuscript 
 Well I guess you get what you pay for, this thing is very hard to put togather, as usual when something is made cheap the screw's never seem to fit, trying to get the wheels to stay on is another disaster. If you don't have the equipment to get this thing together FORGET it! Think I'll just get a shopping cart already assembled 
 The postgraduate seminar that I take part in choose this text because we hoped that it would offer a taste of various aspects of the cultural study of music that we weren't already familiar with, we hoped that it would make a good starting point for interesting discussions on issues in contemporary music and musicology. We were wrong! This book is superficial at best. A large part of every discussion was spent complaining about the poor quality of the scholarship or the hatchet job the editors have obviously done on the articles. Most of the ideas in this book are stale and much better discussions occur in other publications. It's disappointing to see authors of Lawrence Kramer's quality in a collection this bad, his was one of many articles in which simple ideas became confusing because of poor editing. This attempt to make musicology bite size fails miserably. The only useful thing about this collection is the list of further reading at the end of each article 
 I've never given one star to any type of produce before, but the stupidity of this DVD and its fans are shocking.  So revealing!  So true!  If you didn't know fast food was unhealthy, give me a break.  If you think this is realistic, give me a break.  "Supersize Me" is a piece of propaganda meant to turn people away from eating McDonalds food.  The film documents Morgan Spurlock embarking on a perilous quest to eat three meals of McDonalds per day.  This diet has rules too.  Whenever he is asked if he wants a meal to be Super-Sized, he must do it.  He also much try each item on the menu at least once.  He is only allowed to consume items that are in fact on the menu.  The thing is though, if he is really trying to make a valid point, why does he order the Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese meal twice within the first seven days?  This is questionable, because not only is this the most fatty item on the menu, it also made him vomit the first time that he ate it all.  The thing is though, millions of people (some skinner than Spurlock) have this meal and do not throw up.  Why him?  His wife is a vegan chef and he is used to having no meat in his diet.  So why would he choose the biggest item on the menu TWICE in the first week?  There are many, many other items that he couldn't possibly been able to cover.  Not only that, he almost gets no exercise during the month of this experiment, saying that the average American gets little exercise.  His laziness seems to be an exaggeration.  There is some merit to the movie, showing people how unhealthy McDonalds is, but everyone knows that.  They just don't care.  For Spurlock to in any way (even the subtlest of ways) to support the idiots who sue the fast food chains because they became obese, is ludicrous.  It should be mentioned that Wendy's regular hamburger is a quarter pounder, while McDonalds regular burger is 1/10th of a pound.  Also, Wendy's goes up to a triple quarter pounder, something McDonalds has never done.  Burger King introduced the triple cheese burger and QUADROUPLE cheese burger, something McDonalds has never done.  It seems that McDonalds is picked as a scapegoat because it is the most popular.  This movie may have been more credible if it examined the dangers of fast food as a whole, but just to go up against the one corporation is stupid.  If the movie didn't suggest that the corporation doesn't care about it's customers, I wouldn't have a problem, but it does.  Too much of anything, especially food, is bad for someone.  If anyone needed a movie to tell them that fast food is unhealthy, they clearly are seeing the world through a filter.  1/1 
 If I hadn't already read the book I would not have been able to figure out what was happening, because the abridgement hacked up the story so badly. The reader is a different person than the male/female team who did the first five books, and he pronounced everything so differently (names, places, foreign words and phrases) that I couldn't recognize the characters. In addition, his mis-phrasings had a tendency to alter the meaning of conversations he was reading. It was like he did not rehearse it at all. I only got this because there was no unabridged version available, and it was a waste of time and money to get this abridged version 
 Having had to suffer through 1 semester of this book, I was horrified to learn that my school had decided to keep this book for the second semester of signals!  This is book would be much better as a hyperlinked document, because the author continuously references other chapters and formula #'s.  His examples are confusing, and leave you wondering what you are looking for.  A visist to the book's website leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.  Honestly, if you need this book, find another book to use as a reference because you will need it 
 As other reviewers have mentioned, because of the made-up disease which causes her to gain weight, and failure of the character to really learn what she needs to learn from this experience, it is sort of a waste.  Could have been written better - and doesn't get to the heart of the matter 
 My main problem with this hiking book is how it is crafted and its purpose.  I grew up in a town along the coast and have spent my whole life hiking in southern California.  The southern hikes listed in Foghorn Outdoors California Hiking are full of holes and what's really puzzling - - - missing maps.  Forget about taking it along on the hike, it's as heavy as a bottle of water,  and who wants to tear out pages.  
 I was really disappointed with this book. had thought the title would mean it would give more practical advice. sadly it was a book that offered little other than confrontation re sinful thoughts and behaviours. while i am a Christian, i felt people with eating disorders need more compassion than just being smacked around the head with verses and dogma. very let down by this book, as it made me feel WORSE not better...maybe for someone who is nearly recovered, but think it would be very unhelpful for anyone struggling with eating disorder 
 I RECEIVED A CD, THE TANGO CD( THE BEST TANGO ALBUM IN THE WORLD EVER) WAS DEFECTUOUS, SINCE IT PLAYS ALRIGHT  UNTIL THE 12TH SONG, BUT THEN THE SONGS STARTS GIVING WEIRD TONES. AND THE 2ND CD ACTS THE SAME WAY, SINCE MY TANGO ALBUM IS A DOUBLE CD.THE PROBLEM IS NOT FROM THE RADIO, SINCE MY OTHER PURCHASE FROM AMAZON IS IN GOOD SHAPE, AS AL MY OTHER CDS. THE MUSIC ALWAYS STOPS PLAYING RIGHT AT THE SAME TIME OF THE CD, THE 12 TH SONG, SO ITS PRETTY MUCH A CD PROBLEM. I DUNNO WHATS THE REFUND POLICY, OR CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER, ITS SO BAD , COS THIS TANGO CD IS GREAT. I ENJOYED IT MUCH , UNTIL......... TH 
 Okay, I've wanted this film for a very long time, so this year I finally get around to ordering it.  However, I wasn't aware that Ridley Scott ever put together a director's cut nor does the information contained about this particular edition say anything about this DVD being the director's cut.  So, it gets delivered, I open it up excitedly...and see a box on the cover that says INCLUDES RIDLEY SCOTT'S DIRECTOR'S CUT WITH JERRY GOLDSMITH'S SCORE.  Okay, cool.  It INCLUDES the director's cut.  That implies that BOTH the theatrical release AND the director's cut are on the disc.  Not so.  This is ONLY the director's cut...and to be honest, it's not all that great.  And Goldsmith's score is NOT one of his better ones.  I was WANTING the Theatrical Release with that wonderful score by Tangerine Dream, the version I remember seeing so many years ago.  So, now I have to shell out the money for the ULTIMATE EDITION which has both versions on it.  If Amazon is going to sell two versions of this film it really needs to state clearly which is which.  I feel about as shafted as when I bought "The Exorcist" on DVD...only to get THE VERSION YOU'VE NEVER SEEN, which was equally lame 
 even though this book can be read in only one sitting. The Gould vs Dawkins "war" is now Boring. See "The Triumph of Sociobiology" by Alcock, "The Tangled Wing" by Konner. The author has the temerity to attack Dawkins' attitude toward religion, then later to say that Mormonism "is founded on lies." This is not to say I disagree with this statement, only that it shows the contradictions you encounter in this book. Also, the author repeatedly disses Steven Pinker, such as for "being a linguist at MIT" who presumes to apply adaptationist explanations for "everything," and yet expects that we are to accept "a freelance journalist" (the author) as the expert witness to the so-called Darwin wars. Here's one of the author's snide comments which reveal what a know-nothing he is: "If the real purpose and justification of cultures is to spread the genes of their holders, it is hard to see how any sociobiologist could possibly resist conversion to Mormonism." The author would do well to review Cosmides & Tooby's idea that "we are not fitness maximizers, but adaptation executers," and Alcock's distinction between "proximate" and "ultimate" causes 
 Well I loved the book by Joseph Heller even though it can be hard to follow at times. The movie, however, was a huge let down. I did not expect it to be as good as the book, nothing ever is, but this was just bad. The cast sounds great, but the acting too over the top if you ask me. Especially Arkin as Yossarian, he just annoyed me. There were many characters I came to like while reading, but this movie doesn't give you a chance to like any of them. So much of the book is left out, which is to be expected, but it doesn't make any sense if you haven't read it. The anti-war commentary is almost completely lost and it has basically been turned into a comedy. Overall this was a terrible movie, especially considering how good the book was. It gets two starts simply for being associated with the book. Don't waste your money, just read the book 
 Unfortunately I had already ordered these DVD's before I logged onto the bar method website, on the site there are news clips posted from old interviews etc. I read one interview where she was being interviewed at her studio and the reporter was being givin a lesson via a tv segment all about her method. when asked if this was all Burr did to keep in shape, she replied " pretty much" sounded like a vague answer to me, the interviewer asked again later in the segment, so, this is all you need to stay in shape,, once again she answered pretty much, seems to me if you were excited to share your program and sell it, you would say,Im in great shape and this is all I do! I have tired it once and you definately feel it the next day, so we will see. Yvonne 
 Emo noisemaking and Christian themes. The two worst elements of our society combined in a package filled with talentless musicianship. Face it kids this is a fad. A really pathetic fad. Disco was a fad and they has thousands upon thousands of drones listening and participating in the Disco scene. The same happened with Hair Metal and Nu-Metal. Those scenes are completely dead and gone and so will this one be one day. You will look back on this period of your life tied up in this fad in embarrasment of your blatant stupidity. As I always say in my reviews, this is trash and should be treated so accordingly. This band should take their Emo wrist cutting lyrics to heart and kill themselves for the better of humanity. 
 I know that this book has a bright pink cover and, therefore, from the get-go, doesn't raise extraordinarily high expectations, but I was extremely disappointed in this read.  This book has almost no plot.  The characters are bordering on absurd, and they come and go as they please.  The book jumps around chronologically, leaving the reader with little sense of what is happening when.  The fact that Amy, the narrator, is a "private eye" is nowhere near as exciting as it's played out to be on the back cover - the most exciting thing that happens to her is she spends a lot of time on the phone, uncovering "secret identities" and packing her prose with a lot of esoteric lingo. I assume that this is meant to sound smart but really just makes the book difficult to wade through for those of us not in the PI profession.  Additionally, Amy's guy "problems" are incredibly repetitive, I don't think she deserves a boyfriend.  Every time she gets a guy, she finds one little thing wrong with him.  She dumps him, wallows in self-pity over how insane he was, and then meets a new guy, who is of course The One.  At least until he does something crazy.  And so the cycle continues.  This book had potential: otherwise I never would've walked out of the library with it.  But once I had finished blowing through the text in about three hours, I was incredibly greatful that I hadn't spent ten bucks to buy it.  
 I picked up this book with much excitement.  I was looking for excellent historical research, completely unbiased representation of facts, just an overall great, indepth look at the history of christ.  Instead I was extremely disappointed and could not even finish the book.  It is biased beyond belief!  This woman went into writing this book with her particular view and absolute faith in her particular beliefs.  It is not a case of being curious in a subject, doing the research and drawing a conclusion as I had hoped.  It is a case of playing a certain role in this life and retaining no compassion, curiosity, acceptance or understanding of any alternate histories, beliefs, viewpoints, etc. and expelling that specific propaganda on paper.  Very disappointing, very unoriginal, very uninformed.    This book was a complete waste of money and time.  
 Although my nursing school required this book, it is the most confusing and least helpful of all the 9 books I have on care planning and nursing diagnoses. I haven't met anyone who likes this book or finds it user friendly. In all the other books the rationales are written right after the interventions,this book does not use that format making it time consuming and frustrating. The book is unorganized and hard to follow. If this is not a required book,save your money for your tuition. 
 ...if you're in the bathroom with time on your hands! I must admit that I did finish this book and was glad that the ordeal was over.  Puzo (like Leon Uris) definitely lost the touch near the end of his career and this book is no exception.  In just a few hundred pages, President Kennedy II is shown as a tyrant, a socialist, a reactionary, a humanitarian, a political bumbler, a visionary of USA utopia, a man who would kill a few thousand citizens to save himself from impeachment, a liar who can beat the ultimate lie detector, a dear and loving husband/father, etc....how many characters must one man be?  And what's this odd sub-plot of a former-Mormon/Hollywood oddball who on a whim (in less than 10 seconds of consideration when the opportunity presents itself) decides to kill the president of the United States.  Once again another character with fourteen different personalities!.  Puzo even got his basic facts wrong about the Mormons (he should have stuck with the Catholic Church). I would hate to be washed up on a deserted island and find this book washed up on the shore next to me! I would go crazy reading it again 
 I echo the comments of the previous reviewers.  Don't waste your money.  Not only does this book present a tedious repetition of facts and stories already well known to even a casual U2 fan, it can't even get those facts right!  The book states that Bono's father dropped the family off at a Catholic Church before driving himself to another church.  This contradicts the correct statement on the preceding page that Bob Hewson was Catholic, while Bono, his mother and brother were Protestant.  In the same paragraph the Dublin neighborhood of "Glasnevin" is misspelled "Asnevin".  The hearing aid shop from which Bono took his name is misspelled, and perhaps most galling of all, the author can't even get the full name of Larry Mullen, Jr. right!  And this is just chapter one!    I have to agree that this book was simply thrown together to make a quick buck and therefore not worth purchasing.  I would suggest skipping this one and purchasing Bono: In Conversation With Michka Assayas, which includes a pretty good account of Bono's life from the man himself.  
 This is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to read: academic writing style, feeble plot, very forced. There is no humour or humanity in this book. A complete waste of a good tree 
 Its a study guide, not the actual book, waste of money 
 I took Warren S. Warren's freshman chemistry course at Duke with this evil book. It is basically a list of equations. You will not be able to figure out the problems, and since there is no solutions manual or anything comparable, you will not find out how to do them, either, unless you are a brilliant, brilliant person, in which case you should definitely buy this book. Otherwise, stay away.  This book is a summary of his lectures, and let me tell you, he is a terrible lecturer, so if you need this book for class, look forward to not knowing WTF is going on 
 the 6o's Blue note records are some of the greatest recordings, especillay the reissues of Rudy Van Gelder series. Any book has a lot of potential on this topic but the author is clueless-no research, no "where are they now", no inside information. Don't waste your time or money-I've seen liner notes with more insight than this.Buy the music instead 
 Somebody put together curves and equations from other books to make quick money. You will be disapointed. don't buy it  
 I am truly sorry to those who purchased the DVD. I read ALL the reviews and some critical scenes seems to be left out. I would have been totally pissed because I know this movie like that back of my hand. Obviously for those who never saw the movie/VHS, they got to enjoy the movie as is, but for those who had the opportunity to see this GREAT movie uncut, I feel the anger and frustration via your words.  I will not get this DVD, because I believe you all when you say they screwed up this DVD.  Maybe we should tell Oprah about this? Flood her with emails about how they chopped up HER film. With Oprah...you never know 
 I really didn't like this.  The idea for the seer was interesting enough, I suppose, but it wasn't executed well.  And Vesputo... first of all, who the heck names a character Vesputo?  It screams cliche.  Anyways, he was just sort of... semi-evil.  Like he was trying too hard to be manical and ended up looking like a video-game obsessed member of Generation X with the goatee and the shirt that says "I AM THE VILLAN" or some other rot like that.  It just didn't work.  And the whole... 'random assasination of the king' thing wasn't done that well.  I had to read it twice, because I was like "Eh?  What the *heck* just happened here?".  And the romance was something that you'd expect a third grader to write... the handsome prince suddenly shows up after a few hundred pages and it's all "MY LOVE!" and they haven't seen each other for what, a decade or so?  It's kind of ridiculous.  So all in all, it's something like three and a half stars for concept, minus two for execution.  But Amazon doesn't let me do half stars 
 I will give this movie two stars, simply for the two memorable scenes in the movie that make it worth seeing - at least once. The demon coming out of the TV set scene is suprisingly well done, rivaling even what we would see years later in movies like The Ring. The second scene is where the demon kid is chasing a woman around the apartment, then he falls to the ground and an alien demon crawls out of his chest and continues to chase her around the place. There's pastel neon lights flashing in the background, and the whole scene is jam packed with 80's cliches. It's almost like a cross between The Omen, a Billy Idol video, Aliens, and Return of the Living Dead. It's so ridiculously absurd and campy, it makes me crack up every time I see it 
 This book is a self-indulgent wallow in the mire of despair.  Wolfe starts with the supposition that "our earliest ancestors. . . crawled out of the primeval slime," that God is "an unwitting spirit" in "remote eternity," and consequently that prayer is useless and the earth is forgotten, and then whines when he is left with the natural conclusions of a godless world view: that life is accidental, without meaning and without hope.  The characters fumble around, looking for salvation in "a stone, a leaf, an unfound door," (tragically rejecting the Way, the Truth, and the Life) only to find at last that there is no point in looking for salvation at all, since "There is no happy land. There is no end to hunger," "YOU are your world."  This book is unorthodox, unwholesome, and unhealthy.  Avoid it for your own good 
 Well, there's a reason this book is a bargain.  One major and inexusable problem with it is that Philip Caputo failed utterly in his background research for this book.  It is quite obvious that he knows nothing about sailing, let alone sailing traditionally-rigged boats, and he chose to make up for that deficiency by making it up as he went along. With page after page of mangled terminology (you don't haul on SHEETS to raise sails!), poor charachter developement, and dubious plot, I just couldn't take it any more and gave up. It comes off as something that was knocked together in a weekend and sold on the basis of previous sucess.  This may sound a bit harsh, but I read several books a week and this is the only one in the past year or so that stands out as a truly bad book.  It looks like this is being marketed towards the sailing adventure story crowd, and if you're a fan of that genre, I would highly recommend looking elsewere 
 i really try and like this lady tammylee but she is not ideal for a woman like me to try and look like, her booty is too round and seems like she has a big booty complex....she has some great moves and does some fun work, but Leisa Hart, the instuctor on several other "STEEL" videos seems more enjoyable and likable...nothing against Tammilee, but this video set didn't do it for me 
 I love stories of life after death, I see this book as complete fiction though. She claims to have been able to read books when she was 4 years old. When she was 7 is when her dead brother comes to take her and show her around heaven, she didn't actually die like most people that have written books about the after life. Its helps the credibility a bit to have some sort of proof that you died, rather than saying "I went in my sleep and nobody knew about it". After her journey, her brother is explaining to her how to re-enter her body correctly, of all the stories I've read, I've never heard of instructions on how to re-enter. As well, while she is with her brother she is asking questions he whole time, rather than being all knowing like so many others have described in their books. I read the first chapter and decided that this author is just someone who jumped on the afterlife book band wagon and has no credibility 
 This is my 3rd McDermid novel, I previously read 'Mermaids Singing' and 'Wire in the Blood.' McDermid writes good prose but in this 3rd novel I see dangerous repetitions in character types which, if repeated in the next Tony Hill/Carol Jordan book will make that one my last purchase. Generally McDermid paints female police officers as brighter, more diligent and more intuitive than their male counterparts, as well as more often homosexual. The men, with the exception of leading man Tony Hill, are mostly all egotistical, back-stabbing, power-hungry morons of the lowest order, while Hill is rendered impotent -- a redundant bit of emasculation since all the other males are castrated of their moral fiber. The slow mating dance between Hill and Jordan gets a lot of buildup and little payoff. And in this book, the serial killer and the surrounding hunt for him are as limply portrayed as Dr. Hill. The emotional connection between Hill and the killers in the two previous books is missing here, making the entire killer plot read like an afterthought. And the real villain -- not the serial killer but a drug-pushing / illegal-immigrant smuggler loses character focus as the reader is given reason to sympathize with him as well as with the killer. The climactic scenes involving the capture of one villain and the death of another are without any sense of thrill or danger. I was extremely disappointed with this book 
 here's an example of a toy with a great idea but poor product.  My son received this car for his first birthday.  He likes it and by 16 months learned to push the button to make it go.  But after 4 months of light use it stopped rolling.  New batterys don't help.  It sounds like it's working but won't roll.  Dad is taking it apart to try to fix it but we shouldn't have to resort to that in just 4 months.  Aside from that, a major downside is that there is no automatic shutdown.  If your toddler loses interest in the toy after a few minutes (they all do), the car continues to make noise until someone gets up to shut it down (draining the battery).  Seems like a small thing but it gets annoying.  For the price, it may be acceptable to some.  Aside from its problems it's perfect for toddlers.  There is just one button to push to make it go; push it once and it goes in forward; push it again and it turns to the left; push it again it goes forward again.  So it's not something you can truly "steer" or anything but it does give a toddler a sense of control.  If they could add a auto shutdown feature and improve the reliability it could be a great little toy 
 If you like hard science fiction, I would recommend trying Permutation City and Diaspora by Greg Egan instead. Another book more similar to Eon but far more readable is "Rendezvous with Rama" by Arthur C. Clarke (not the sequels). Greg Bear wasn't able to convey the sense of wonder of the situation he describes, in fact, sometimes I have found very hard to understand his descriptions, as others reviewers say (not because of their technicallity, but simply because they are sometimes very convoluted). Also, part of the plot seems outdated, be aware that this book was published in 1985 (USSR, Cold War...). I haven't been able to read past a third of the book, so this review may be a bit biased ; 
 I'm a huge fan of chic DIY projects and was very excited about this book.  For $25 I learned: 1. How to turn containers for stuff into.... containers for other stuff!  2. Stacking things (and maybe if you feel like it gluing them together) = instant furniture!  3. For just $125.00 and hours of labor I can have a shoddily constructed and unattractive shelving unit!  Lacking a chair?  All you need is saran wrap (about $3) and a chair!      Filled with fluff and ironic hipster commentary, there isn't one thing in this book I would be proud to say I had created. well-intentioned but ultimately a huge disappointment and complete waste of money.  
 This book had a lot of extreme views.  Demoss generalizes constantly.  I felt she twisted scripture to explain her point of view.  I did gleam some good out of the book.  I am a fairly new Christian and I felt it was more harmful then good.  I felt it could give a Christain women a feeling there are only absolutes to God's way, that we are not individuals.  I felt it weighed me down more than lifted me up.  I had to go back to God's word and study because at times I felt the study was toxic.  I think Demoss is very biased and narrow minded.  I would especially not recommend it if you are a new Christian.  I also about group study I would only recommend it if you are with seasoned Christians who are willing to be objective about this book.   
 the typical self proclaimed china hand writing books catered to the western audience with typical stories everyone hears if you are in the investing biz.  no added value except to "reveal" to the world what had happened to him or her.  do these writers trully understand china?; same question to be posed to the thousands of current and potential investors into china.  and can they offer insights that are practical, realistic and offers a true fact of what is happening daily on the ground?  i seriously doubt any writer can offer this in respect to china because china is a story of limitless permutations.  there is only one commonality in china, which is its damn hard to get it right, because there is no right or wrong in this environment.  so how does anyone who wants to know how to operate in this environment learn?  i beg to differ, but its not gonna be thru a book written by the gangs of so called "china hands" out there.  these books are like the ones that came out supporting the great hype about the "new ecnomony" when the heat was scorching white.  opportunistic but offers little value.  i'll only buy the soft cover versions of these type of books or reading it as borrowed material. there is absolutely nothing valuable in this type of undertaking other than entertaining one on a slow afternoon. the author doesn't trully understand the reasons why things and events like those that transpired while he was ther in the early 90s, he doesn't understand the deep down psychic of the chinese person that he is dealing with.  chinese as a society is very complicated and extremely difficult to "read", and with the thousands of years of upheavals and sufferings of the masses, a twisted sense of whats right or wrong flows thru to today's society.  understand the meaning of "middle kingdom" and the world will have a starting point on why things are done the way they are today.  understand why "putonghua" has to be implemented  to bring all the different sects of chinese together is also another start.  i have yet to read any of this and a hundred other basic seeds of discontent that creates the china it is of today and why it behaves the way it does.  i doubt that anyone will be able to put it in on paper with  a certain thoroughness as it will create lots of uneasiness and tensions that has been around for 5000 years.  chinese will not accept a book on this and the western reader will have difficulty fathoming the gist and hidden weight behind each nuance.  
 I purchased this cd expecting a solid group of songs from JMM.  However, this album really lacks when it comes to good material. There really isn't one song that stands out, nothing worth playing over and over.  The entire album is pretty much "blowing flowers out of your [rear end]" types of songs. The title cut, "Pictures" is about a guy that likes to take pictures of his family and looks forward to taking more.  It sounds like something an 8 year old wrote.  Rather than wasting 15 bucks on this cd, get a Pat Green or Brad Paisley cd, they are much more worth your money 
 greg iles is one of my favourite author but this book is such a downer.. i tried reading it and fell asleep twice that in the end i gave up even before reaching page 100... if jeffrey archer was to write this story i'm sure he would;ve done a good job... the book was too long, it;s confusing and just plain boring.. i was really dissapointed as i am a HUGE fan of his books especially blood memory and sleep no more wish it could've been better..really d 
 This book is so lame... I regret every minute I spent reading it.  
 This is NOT the best microwave popcorn popper. We tried this at a friend's house after Christmas, I was raving about my own new popcorn popper (the NordicWare Microwave Microwave Popcorn Popper that WAS available on Amazon) and my buddy wanted to show me his popcorn popper, the Presto popper. (Such is the exciting life of younger married men with small children). He has to use a disposable base each time he uses the Presto Popper and the popcorn is not as good. Get the NordicWare instead, much better popcorn and it is just a well-designed piece of plastic with a lid, no gimmicky "Concentrator" baloney 
 I enjoyed the tour through literature and philosophy and felt the author did a good job of outlining the nature of the problem.  Like other reviewers I was disappointed with the emphasis on Christianity in the end- with graphics of the tortures of hell and commentary about death being the greater leveler.  Until I got to that section I sustained the belief that Alain de Botton was writing with some neutrality.  His emphasis on Christianity, while ignoring other world faiths and spiritual beliefs have to offer, admits bias and disappoints greatly as the book comes to a close.  Certainly Buddhism, for example, would have much to say about status anxiety as well?  The first part of the book is much more rewarding to read.  By the end of the book when the author starts biasing his comments within an unexpected Christian framework, shattering my belief I was reading a neutral book with intellectual integrity, I was truly sorry I had recommended it to a friend 
 Didn't like the recipes in this one--just not our taste.    
 shouldn't a "masterpiece" of comedy be ... i don't know ...   funny 
 Personally, I found this workout extremely difficult to follow; the moves are simply not broken down enough to be understood. After pushing myself to go back to every part I didn't understand, I grew frustrated. Other reviews have mentioned that being able to pick up the moves comes from such repetition,  as I have obviously tried, but that technique killed my motivation and the thrill, both of which I believe are integral to any workout. And in my opinion any workout that one pays for should deliver a deserving output; one shouldn't have to teach themselves the moves.   To a less significant degree, I agree with the reviews that comment on the "cheesiness" of the video. At first, such cheesiness made me laugh, and then as I grew frustrated, it merely made me further annoyed. What I feel also adds to the cheesiness is instructor Marie Forleo's unsuccessful motivation attempts, which are not only redundant, but suggestive in a most unnecessary way.   I don't mean to sound so aggressively negative--I just wish I had been able to learn the moves, because they did look like fun 
 It's a bad idea to create a character-driven sci-fi when your characters are this annoying.  The majority of Children of the Mind consists of inane dialogue between characters that are impossible to care about.  The characters are so one-dimensional and predictable that you already know what they'll say before they say it.  Peter says nothing except smart alecky remarks, Val spends the whole book whining loudly about not being a real person, Novinha is as crazy and hard-headed as she's been for the last two books, and Ender spouts off a bunch of trite, up-with-people garbage every chance he gets.  Somehow, Card even managed to make Jane more irritating than my ex-girlfriend during PMS.  The only decent characters in this book are Miro and Wang Mu, and they aren't nearly enough to save the story.  I admit it: I only made it a little over half-way through Children of the Mind.  I couldn't take the dialogue anymore.  That's not to mention the ridiculous plot, which centers on two children warping around the universe, engaging in philosophical discussions with caricatures of Japanese and Polynesian culture, in an attempt to avert a war between species.  If you're that curious to learn how the Ender Quartet concludes, do what I should've done from the beginning: find a plot synopsis somewhere and save yourself the pain of reading this garbage 
 Hey,  ever notice that any clown can just write a provactive piece on Muslim Theology these days (even if they were an art major) and a whole mess of suckers just fall for it and pay them money to buy the book?     Ok,  this also needs to be stated.   Let us look at 99% of the anti-Islam books on Amazon.com and here are the authors:  Robert Spencer Bat Yeor Andrew G Bostom Joel C. Rosenberg  Don Richardson Gilles Kepel Thomas W. Lippman  Jessica Stern Daniel Pipes Steven Emerson  Daniel Benjamin  Theres a pattern there if you look close enough at the names in this abridged list. Basically, they are all connected to a country which America has a "special relationship" with and have written their books as a part of a P.R. campaign to demonize further those who appose any policy of that country in its daily ethnic clansing and biggotry.   Get my drift?   Theres a clearcut agenda there.   Most of the other anti-Islam books are written by missionaries (obviously an agenda) and apostates (obviously an agenda as well).  Is it too much work to understand Islam from sources which are respected by Muslims?   Why do you guys like to take all your information on Islam 3rd party?  That makes little sense and shows total insincerity towards learning exactly what the Muslims belive.   Seem to me more people would rather beleive stretched out interpretations that can be attributed to nobody else by authers with an agenda.   Hey,  do you expect me to purchase a book on Christian doctrines written by a Muslim or Hindu?   Does that make any sense at all?   WAKE UP!! 
 Ima huge DPG fan and I can honestly say that this album is str8 garbage. No disrepsect to Daz but he really slipped up on this album with his flow and lyrics. Kurupt was average. Beats on here were terrible with exception of a few tracks. only good tracks are DPGC Music, Push Bacc. Rest are average or just suck. Wait 4 Cali Iz Active or just listen 2 Dogg Food 4 now. Dont get this albu 
 I was disappointed with this book. Part of the problem may be that I didn't realize that the book only applies to felted wool sweaters; none of the ideas presented in the book can be used for another other type of sweater. Additionally, there are very few patterns or specifics in the book; it consists mainly of photographs of projects that others have done. 
 Reissued in August 2006, the novel is part of the Dirk Pitt series; an ongoing character from Clive Cussler.  The action surrounds a U.S. aircraft, Vixen 03, that crashes in a Colorado lake in 1954. It contained 36 quick-death germ bombs, but two are missing when Pitt and his pals find the sunken plane some 30 years later.  The missing canisters are in the hands of some bad guys whose mission is to sail a battleship up the Potomic River and unleash the bombs on Washington. D.C.  The premise is a bit silly and the writing is highly dated (the novel was initially published in the 1970s). Pitt seemingly has super-hero qualities - without having to dress in a phone-booth - and his pals always seem to arrive just in the nick of time to grab victory out of the clutches of defeat. I was waiting for "zowie," "pow," and "bam" to roll from the pages as the good guys battle those pesky evil-doers!  The novel sets up well to the point of the discovery of the aircraft and Pitt piecing together the mystery surrounding the crash. After that, it becomes a tepid battle against time, with a sophomoric ending worthy of a creative writing class, circa 7th Grade.       
 Sorry - there is no forgiving the editing of this DVD.  It is in a word infuriating.  There is no way to connect with the living, performing musicians on stage "captured" (presumably) by the cameras.  The editing is an object lesson in how to wreck performance footage.  I find it hard to believe that the creative forces behind Iron Maiden talked themselves into this massacre of the footage.  Add to that (or subtract rather) that the sound is thin and I guarantee I will never watch it again.  I didn't even make it thru once.  This product should be taken off the market and redone.  Period 
 Let me start out by saying that I am a great admirer of Richard Dawkins. I find his work, especially 'The Selfish Gene' and 'The Extended Phenotype' to be extremely enlightening and a joy to read.   Sadly, in this book Dawkins largely repeats himself and at the same type manages to down-scale his arguments for less capable readers.   In short, if you've read other works by Dawkins and have a healthy dose of scientific education this book will often be boring.  I highly reccomend 'The Selfish Gene 
 The title is completely misleading.  I purchased this book and software from Broderbund, after reading the reviews posted here at Amazon, believing the book and software would help me covert PDF files that I could not Save or print in its orginal format into ones I could. I can say for sure,in my opinion, the other reviews of this book led me down the "fools primrose path." Perhaps I should have read the reviews more carefully. Of course the fault is entirely mine 
  This is my third Asus mother board. All were great, manual was excellent and email support was swift. Now all of these reasons to buy asus are missing. Manual provides no assistance, zero. FAQ online, nothing. email for assistance, no reply. Asus user Forum, no help. Got all accomplished without assistance. Went to register .... and couldn't get that done, so I gave up on it. I've wasted 38 hours on account of missing basic information & support. My previous motherboards (ASUS) were well documented with excellent definitions of BIOS options, etc. Everything went smoothly. I expected the same excellent support from ASUS today, I didn't get it. No more Asus. Be ware 
 Writing style a bit stodgy, but a lot of good fact based information on the subject of the much hyped Hyrogen economy which I have not seen set out so clearly or comprehensively anywhere else 
 I loved "Wishcraft" when it first came out decades ago.  Then, it was relevant to my life.  Now in my fifties, retired from a physically-active job for medical reasons, and planning my future, I bought this book.  The next day, I returned it.  Barbara seems to think that forty is old.  Odd, considering she's older than I am.  Just please be aware that if you're over forty, this book is not going to be terribly relevant to your life.  It's probably terrific for people under forty, but if you're past early mid-life, forget it.  Another thing that made me question the validity of Barbara's more recent work was her insistence that once you've nabbed a partner, or settled into a career, or otherwise gotten your life together, you should put away your mirror and let yourself go.  Yes, I'm serious.  I'm paraphrasing, but that's the advice.  And it's psychologically unsound.  My advanced drama class used to put on shows for retirement homes and long-term care centers.  One thing I learned was that when a person (of any age) stopped caring for their appearance, it was a sign of depression and, in many cases, giving in and giving up.  I also know, from a personal experience with clinical depression, that the quickest way to lift your spirits -- even a little -- is to dye your hair or buy a great new outfit.  This applies to men as well as to women.  Yet Barbara Sher encourages us to just forget about our physical appearance.  I wonder how much longer she'll be writing (or doing anything else).  Angela Lansbury, on her wonderful videotape of several years ago, said that when she got older and was given more matronly acting jobs, she gained more than a few pounds.  And she decided it was all right.  She was older.  She didn't have to prance around in a swimsuit.  But Ms. Lansbury couldn't stand it, and lost that weight.  She respected herself too much to just let it all hang out.  From what I've learned, that's healthy.  What Barbara Sher advocates is not.  Again, this book is probably helpful to younger people.  But the "any age" she refers to in the title doesn't go much past forty 
  The first few pages grab my attention however the story involved far too much historical information and description. This writer loses his reader by not bringing the hero back into the story almost at the end of the book after a long absence. The hero was the main reason I bought the book in the first place, he didn't reappear for almost three hundred pages later. 
 Imagine my disappointment when, after reading all of the reviews about Alan Rickman's great reading style, I get this audio book in the mail only to find that it's actually read by Peter Jeffrey. Alan Rickman's name isn't even on the jacket 
 He's done,he fell off just like Master P,No Limit,Ruff Ryders all them,murder Inc.His first 2 albums were good,between 1999-2002 was Pastor Troys glory years and when he had the juice.All You sucka Ass N*ggaz get over it 
  Apparently, this is a film that many women, who have read the book, can make enjoyable.   Characters, including Anne & the Captain, display wooden acting. Poker-faces. Others speak at a clipped pace. The properness of the times allowed for personality, as shown well in "Pride & Prejudice" 1996 & 2006, but not here. Shyness, plainness, or slowness, may be portrayed likeably, with some personality.   Both Anne & the Captain maintain wide-eyed, desperate, looks, constantly. Many of us do get nervous within romance; but we are compelled, by conversation, and activity, to interrupt our nervousness with personality. Thus, Anne's & the Captain's constant, wide-eyed, nervousness is un-natural. All of us at the age of Anne and the Captain, would have refined our nervousness to be responses of: shyness, thought, distance, hopefulness, approval, or alarm.   You understand the quiet thoughts, because of the story, in spite of the confusing, paralyzed, looks; rather than because of them. You come to like Anne and the Captain toward the end, in spite of the wooden acting, because of the story's ending.  This film has pretty scenery; such as walks along the ocean. The costumes are often very unique and well done. There is beautiful singing in one scene, and even better, wonderful singing over the closing credits.   Good period, romance films are so few, and so desired, that many women labor to imagine this film better than it is. I applaud their positive imaginations. However, they continued their fanciful, wishful, thoughts into rating this film. A reviewer, who liked the film, says she had read the book, and she cites a huge amount of important background from the book that is not shown in the film. A poor script for those who have not read the book. Awful directing made awful acting.   I would like to see this good story re-made by a better Director.   Well-made romance films are: "Pride & Prejudice", "Wives & Daughters", "North & South". Fairly made is "Under the Greenwood Tree" 
 i went to see this movie when it first came out, and i nearly fell asleep watching it. THIS MOVIE IS NOT WORTH WATCHING. it's so fake, & it's easy to tell whats going to happen next 
   This is bring to your notice that the product that i have orderd has not reached me yet. I request you to do the needful. Thanking you Prince Georg 
 DVD was damaged on reciept and since I did not have the packing materials I had to trash it and buy it again 
 Even as a kid, I remember getting bored with Pippi quickly. Unless I'm not recalling correctly, each chapter stands alone, so there's no real plot as such. The other thing that bothered me was that the author bothered to create a defiant, irreverant, spunky girl hero, yet her two friends are stereotypically male and female, to the extent that they don't even have personalities--they're just cardboard cutouts, foils for the main character. Not only is Annika fearful, hesitant, afraid of risking adult disapproval, and not wanting to get her dress dirty, but she's not in the least influenced by Pippi to be more adventurous. Lindgren sold lots of books but to my mind didn't accomplish much. Unlike Caddie Woodlawn, this protagonist is too far out in left field to truly inspire girls 
 If you are buying this book to help build strength like  I did this is the wrong book for you.  It may be good to build mass but not strength.  The premise of the book is pounds per minute and this will give you your biggest gains.  I've tried in the past with lower weight higher reps and more sets and did not see good strength gains.  This best strength gains I've had were due to the opposite of what this book suggest.  Maybe I'm complaining about something the book was not intended for but it sounded good because the title.  There are not many books out there just on how to build bench power I'm still searching 
 Although an accomplished musician and with thorough knowledge of music theory, this book is too much theoretic for me. I can't get hold of the message.. 
 Similarities: The cover looks exactly the same, the main character goes by "Lang" (Lang Reilly - Robert Langdon!!), it takes place all over Europe, the storyline also has to do with the Knights Templar, people die, etc. (Seems as if the author doesn't have very many original ideas...)  Differences: The main charachter is not likeable, many many spelling mistakes (??), the last page is uneccesary (in my opinion), and it seemed like important parts didn't get the attention to detail that they deserved.  I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 because it held my interest enough for me to finish it, but it's not something I would read again 
 I'm a gamer.  I play for hours a day and currently use a simple MS intellimouse optical.  Well I was looking for something a little more pro, and in my searching I saw the Razer line of gaming mice.  I uncharacteristly ordered one based on the specs without trying one out, only to find that it is far too bulky and uncomfortable to play with.    It's got large rubber triming down each side, so it is cumbersome to get to the left side buttons.  I only say the left side because the right side buttons are so miserably place you will NEVER, EVER, be able to reach them during game play.  It also feels too long and flat, so the scroll wheel is note easily reached, and your hand does not rest comfortably.   Yeah, it looks great, and I'm sure it's doing an amazing job a moving precisely.  However, I can't get it to move correctly in my hand due to its horrible shape, so for gaming, it's rather worthless.  
 Before that it was kind of nice, but it cannot focus in even semi-low light. It is definitely light and easy to take everywhere, but there are so many conditions where the results are disappointing. No way I would call the output HD quality, just the best SD ever with a 16 * 9  format. And then it broke 
 This is one odd hybrid of a movie as it mixes Raymond Chandler-style film noir sensibilities with an oblique black comedy sense to present an overly convoluted story of obsession and betrayal. That still  sounds promising until you actually watch the 2004 film and witness so much false posturing and so many ridiculous story turns that it ends up being an utter misfire. Director David Moreton has a talent for creating a suitably decadent atmosphere for the unraveling mystery elements, but he cannot set nor maintain an emotional tone that makes sense for the viewer. A major part of the problem is the disjointed, overly stylized script by Moreton and David Hensley that seems to aim for a gay variant of "Pulp Fiction".  The plot focuses on LA-based graphic novelist Dean Seagrave, whose idyllic relationship with boyfriend Pablo ends suddenly when he disappears. In his desperate search, Dean flies off to Buenos Aires where he faces barriers in Pablo's domineering spitfire mother and a strange pair of siblings with an unexplained connection to Pablo. The various twists and revelations finally lead Dean to Pablo but at a price neither expects. David Sutcliffe (now of "The Gilmore Girls") has usually been a likeable actor in small movie roles and larger TV ones, but with his first starring role in a feature film, he has been ill-served with an increasingly frustrating character. He responds by being alternately petulant and belligerent, the Ugly American prototype taken down several pegs due to his unfettered obsession. To Sutcliffe's defense, only a larger-than-life screen personality of the caliber of Nicholson or at least Russell Crowe could have any shot of success in the role.  In much briefer roles, Antonio Sabato, Jr., much ballyhooed for a frontal nudity flash, barely registers otherwise, while Sonia Braga hams it up as his mother. Somewhat better are Celina Font and Leonardo Brezizcki as the mysterious sister and brother, even though they have to play their roles so close to the vest as to become dramatically inert. Cast against type, Jennifer Coolidge is criminally wasted as Dean's aggressively indifferent editor. The preposterous ending simply compounds the pointlessness of the entire venture and the muddled motivations of the characters involved. On the debit side, cinematographer Ken Kelsch makes Buenos Aires look enticing, and composer Marco D'Ambrosio provides appropriately atmospheric music. The 2005 DVD contains an alternate ending, a couple of deleted scenes (including a striptease by Sabato), the original theatrical trailer and a making-of featurette, all of which provide limited prurient interest 
 I subscribed to Food & Wine for a while and was continuously disappointed. The articles are on the superficial side and more importantly a lot of the recipes and product reviews are not as well researched as they should have been. I experienced more than one flop trying their stuff. The magazine tries very hard to be trendy and pick up the latest and greatest in the cooking and restaurant scene without being careful enough in deciding what is actually an important or meaningful trend rather than a fad. This magazine can't hold a candle to "Bon Appetit" or "Gourmet" 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 This was the first Hard Case publication book that I have tried.  It won't be the last, but I was hardly impressed with King's story.    I don't so much mind having a story with no ending (I got the point even without the author's afterword that was obviously meant to propitiate his regular readers who he correctly feared would be disappointed by this latest work), but couldn't King have given more of a mystery?  That is, after all, what is expected of a crime-mystery book.  I can't believe that I was asking too much.  Instead, I was treated to 178 pages of "Welcome to Maine!"   
 As a lover and avid collector of books, I had high hopes for this book -- at first glance it seemed entrancing, especially the topic.  Unfortunately, once I started reading it more carefully, my spirits sank.  Some of the  pictures are visually interesting, but most are not.  Even more  disappointing, there is not much substantive information either.  If you  like the idea of this book and are looking for a more satisfying read,  check out At Home With Books : How Booklovers Live With and Care for Their  Libraries by Estelle Ellis(Editor), et al.  That book is worth every penny,  and you'll enjoy it 
 The book started off getting me real excited about sustainable farming.  I was eager to turn the page and learn more, but as i turned the page, nothing materialized.  I learned a lot about soil health and management, but when it got around to details about specific vegetables, growing seasons, and pest prevention, the book was lacking 
 I had never read anything by Roth and when I finally got around to him I made the mistake of picking The Plot Against America. I enjoy "what if" books and found the idea compelling... unfortunately the book is not. It doesn't dare enough in imagining an alternative (and frightening) scenario, it fails at creating suspence and pathos at almost every turn, and it's a slow and disjointed yawn of a book. Characters are mostly very flat and the there are pages and pages of truly useless page fillers... I can't imagine why i would ever want to pick up another book of his.   You need to be a genius to act so poorly on such a good idea for a story. 
 I was going to buy this book because it was so highly recommended by Dr. Phil among others. When I checked the reviews at amazon books I decided it would be safer to check it out at my local library and I have to say THANKS FOR THE WARNING. This book was so bad I wanted to throw up. Who would raise their kids like this. Why would you want to make food a control issue and teach your kids animals are disposable. Whats up with the spanking. Why would you beat your own kids! Honestly, it might work but so would hitting them over the head with a 2X4. We are their parents, surely we can do better than that! 
 I had to read this book in ninth grade honors English.  I thought the book was one more the more profound wastes of time I had ever expended when I was done.  Now that I'm in college however, I do not despise the book as much.  I still feel that it is of very little value.  Had the author been white and not helped along by Ophra, this work would be largely unnoticed.  It's just another story about how someone had a rough life... with nothing to differentiate it from all of the other books like it.  The reason I have rated it so low is because it seemed to be an agenda setting work.  Maya Angelou is black and has used this book to help push her liberal agenda.  Again - if Maya Angelou was white and was not well liked by Ophra, the book would have flopped.  I would not recommend this at all... especially if you are a conservative.  
 When I first purchased this item, I loved it. There were a few times the GPS led me astray, but generally, it really helped me get from place to place in my job. It helped my find places where I did not know where they were, or helped my find short cuts from place to place.  However, soon after I got it, it quit "acquiring satellites". It would try and try to find satellites (even though it showed them on one of the screens). Most often it would never find the satellites, or if it did, it was about the time I arrived at my location. The GPS had trouble no matter what location I was in, whether rural or city.  I sent it in for repair, and from what I can tell of the paper I received when it was returned (which was very vague)to me, they replaced it.  Unfortunatly, it is still doing the same thing. It is a great data management system, however, and I love that it interfaces with "Word".  The GBS is a big disappointment. It's overpriced for what it can truly provide. 
 This book is very very much out of date! Fortunately I read much better and up-to-date books so I know what dog training is about nowadays. And that is NOT what Dog Training for Dummies wants to make you believe 
 An anguished, twentysomething filmmaker, mourning the loss of his wife, leaves L.A. to find himself.  Or something.    So he travels to his hometown of San Francisco, where he reconnects with old friends and enemies.  There he remains true to himself while he wryly observes all the phonies and neurotics, finally meeting a deep and sincere woman with whom he can begin to heal over the loss of his wife.  This is a typical indie film, in the sense that its satirical targets are all so old.  Phony literary parties with their pretentious poetry readings (one scene bears a striking resemblance to the literary party in Parker Posey's THE DAYTRIPPERS); shallow artsy types; crude Hollywood studio suits (shades of SWIMMING WITH SHARKS or THE BIG PICTURE, take your pick).  Indeed, the whole trip north to San Francisco evokes SIDEWAYS (although this film predates SIDEWAYS).  However, this film in no way matches the quality of THE DAYTRIPPERS or SIDEWAYS or even THE BIG PICTURE.  Many quirky scenes, but the characters aren't engaging enough.  That, plus the sense that we've seen all these character types and their situations many times before, makes for a rather boring experience.  There are a few strong scenes.  The opening with the studio executive is funny .  Even so, the executive, and especially the agent, are very broadly drawn caricatures, which is not true of all the characters, giving this film an uneven feel.  What's worse, this film meanders, like SIDEWAYS, but it doesn't meander anyplace especially interesting.  So I was bored.  Vanessa Marcil's scenes as the dead wife were poignant (I wish she did more film work), but her scenes are brief, hardly enough to save this film 
 Plenty of other reviewers have mentioned the mess that passes for the plot and writing; ultimately this is a parody of a hoax and so good for a laugh in places but offers little to sustain interest. By far the best part of the whole experience comes from the audiotape edition: hearing Burt Reynolds pause each time before pronouncing "Booger" with great relish is an absolute treat 
 Pearl Jam are more of a band of the 90s, and really they should of stayed their and done something else different because the last decent album they released was "Yield". Thats not to say "Binuaral" and  "Riot Act" are terrible albums its just the production on both of them is bad, Eddie Vedders singing is a bore and the songs just are'nt their, thats not to say you should not have them in your CD collection - hah!  As for this laughable Pearl Jam at the garden DVD, well that just reinforced why Pearl Jam are a band of the 90s, and back then they were an energetic and proper enthusiastic live band.  Since then it blatantly seems they have become slacker and boring, fatter and unexciting and older (which is no excuse) to be such a bore on the stage. You would never beleive how bad this band has disintergrated over the years.  No passion whatsoever, they just look like they are their for the moeny - which of course is a huge shame 
 I bought this item for $40 online and then found out my Canon Camera didnt need a Cannon brand charger and I could have bought one for $10 instead. In total I spent for this charger which included the shipping and handling. Not worth it. Go to another store and by one for $10 
 For the first couple of weeks the Snack Trap worked perfectly. After that, my daughter (7 months old) figured out how to remove the top (it is just a soft plastic cover like a tupperware, but easily removed), and we have since been struggling to keep her from dumping, throwing, or shaking the snacks all around the house.  On the positive side, the flaps for the top are very soft, and when she does reach in, there is no worry about her harming her hands or fingers. If only the lid had a locking mechanism or was screwed on, then this would work perfectly. As it is, my daughter loves it, but we hate cleaning up the mess 
 This is one of the worst books I have ever read, and I have read many.  The underlying  facts constitute a  legally fascinating horror story, but there is no helpful glue between the facts  and this author's contribution to the story.    Moreover,   aspects of the underlying story are just not credible.  What really happened?  This book gives us no clue 
 This album blows it is a waste of money... the song selection is horrible just like the other time 
 After reading Emlyn Williams' book about the Moor Murders, I was hoping to get a better understanding from Ian Brady, the convicted murderer himself. I discovered that reading this book that I had mixed reaction. First, he would have made a great writer just like Ted Bundy would have been a great lawyer or politician if they hadn't murdered innocent people mostly women and children which is a sad reminder of what might had been for so many people, the families and friends of the victims themselves and the families of Bundy and Brady. It is a shame but Brady does offer insight into the man who views other serial killers like Bundy, Gacy, the Green River Killer (before he was known to everybody), the Kingsbury Run Murderer, Jack the Ripper, etc. Brady gives a pretty good idea of what he sees in the criminals with the same arrogance that Bundy once did trying to find the Green River Killer for the Seattle cops. Anyway, BRady will remain in prison for the rest of his life. His partner Myra Hindley died after this book was published in prison as well. Nothing excuses Brady's crimes, the Moors Murders were some of the most vicious crimes in British history. Anyway, the book is interesting to read and reread again because Brady's writing isn't always clear. He is better than most new writers or inexperienced ones. BRady clearly could have had a writing career rather than be written about for his crimes against humanity. It's a shame and a pity that Brady and HIndley did horrendous things to children and Edward Evans. Even as I was reading this, I was following the JonBenet Ramsey case with John Mark Karr and the coverage he got. 
 I will give this movie two stars, simply for the two memorable scenes in the movie that make it worth seeing - at least once. The demon coming out of the TV set scene is suprisingly well done, rivaling even what we would see years later in movies like The Ring. The second scene is where the demon kid is chasing a woman around the apartment, then he falls to the ground and an alien demon crawls out of his chest and continues to chase her around the place. There's pastel neon lights flashing in the background, and the whole scene is jam packed with 80's cliches. It's almost like a cross between The Omen, a Billy Idol video, Aliens, and Return of the Living Dead. It's so ridiculously absurd and campy, it makes me crack up every time I see it 
 Lucio Fulci...while many may not be familiar with the name or his work, he has developed a dedicated and even hardcore audience, mostly due to the extremely graphic nature of the horror films he made from the late 70's into the 80's.  What some may not know are those films only made up part of his repertoire, as he also was involved in thrillers, musicals, comedies, westerns, and even a sword and sorcery picture, titled Conquest (1983).  This Italian/Spanish/Mexican production (it states this in the beginning during the credits, and, for some reason, it didn't inspire a sense confidence in this viewer), directed by Fulci, stars individuals I've never heard of, including a fairly well muscled Jorge Rivero (Rio Lobo), the very effeminate Andrea Occhipinti (Bolero), and the very naked Sabrina Siani (sounds like a western...The Muscled, the Effeminate, and the Naked).  So what is the film about?  I really wish I could say with a degree of certainty, but the plot, what there was, was pretty convoluted.  There's a young warrior named Ilias (Occhipinti) who, prior to leaving his village (I guess to go off to become more manly), is presented with a magical bow, one that shoots arrows made of pure light, that is once the user figure out how to activate that feature.  Until that happens, it can be used to shoot regular arrows.  Anyway, Ilias goes off, and meets up with a nomadic wanderer named Mace (Rivero), whose main choice of weapon is a very poorly made pair of nunchucks, or, two harden pieces of wood attached by a length of rope.  While they're running around bonding and stuff (ew), a local evil sorceress named Ocron (Siani), I thought it was Okra, as that what it kept sounding like throughout the film, learns of a man with a strange and powerful weapon (the bow...I find it difficult to believe few people in this world had not heard of a bow and arrow, probably one of the earliest forms of ranged weapons) and knows she must possess it for her own.  Also, she's been having dreams regarding her own demise at the hands of a faceless warrior, one who shoots her with an arrow.   In an effort to prevent these premonitions from becoming a reality, she sends her various minions to retrieve Ilias and his weapon, which leads up to a some what climatic final battle between good and evil...a common theme in the genre, a hero, or a group of heroes, suffers adversity to rid the land of a powerful enemy blah, blah, blah...  I've seen a lot of films, and I've seen a number of films within the sword and sorcery genre, and I have to say Conquest falls a bit short in comparison.  It does meet a number of requirements within the genre (heroes, magic, good, evil), but lacks in the execution.  First thing you'll notice is nearly the entire film is shot with a sense that someone smeared Vaseline on the camera lens, giving everything a hazy quality sure to induce headaches early on (the film runs 92 minutes).  Also, Fulci must own stock in a company that sells fog producing machines, as nearly every scene also was inundated with a heaping helping of smoke, further obscuring the viewer's ability to see what's going on...the acting isn't horrible, but the dialog is...an example...Ilias and Mace are trapped in a cave and Ilias spots a snake, to which Mace responds, "He's harmless if he doesn't bite you."  Well duh...if a ten-ton boulder was suspended over my head with a piece of twine, it would harmless unless the string broke...the characters themselves are goofy and lacking any sense of likeability.  An example of this is Mace and Ilias (our two heroes) are traveling together, and Mace is learning how to use the bow.  They come across a lowly, completely non-threatening hunter, carrying a dead animal, and Mace shoots and kills him and they take the dead animal so that they may eat it...how very heroic...oh yeah, Mace seems to have a psychic link with animals, and doesn't kill them, but has no problems killing others who've killed animals and taking their food to eat for himself.  Ocron (the evil sorceress) sports a metal, horned bikini bottom and no top, and spends a lot of time having intimate relations with snakes (ew) and eating the brains of her recently killed victims (you see, the head is the `temple of secrets' and it's also quite tasty, or so I've heard).  She commands odd group of henchmen, including wolfmen, regular men, and various animated zombie-like characters, all enabling her to lord over a relatively small group of savages.  Most all the women in the film are topless, which helps, but is entirely gratuitous, serving no real purpose other than to take your mind off the fact the film is so weak in general.  The directing ranges from passable to poor, including pointless POV shots, stupid slow motion that only serves to drag the run time out much further than needed, and ineptly choreographed fight scenes.  I found the mostly electronic musical score to be highly annoying, monotonous, and inappropriate.  Fans of Fulci's stylistic approach to visceral gore will enjoy the inclusion of a smattering of graphic scenes here (brains, puss leaking sores, gore spurting wounds), but it's nowhere near the levels in his horror films, so they may be ultimately dissatisfied.  People not familiar with his penchant for splattery will probably be put off and find it hard to watch.  Blue Underground presents an exceptional widescreen print transfer on this DVD, despite all the funky cinematography.  Special features include two theatrical trailers (U.S. and international), poster and still galleries with lots of good-looking pictures, and a fairly comprehensive and informative biography on Lucio Fulci.  All in all, unless you're a Fulci completist, you might want to skip Conquest, as its' appeal is extremely limited, in my opinion.  Cookieman108 
 uh......... no this book had litle to be desired and its just not cool with all them big words i mean come on.  Whats a sherry and what is an  amontdillo i dont even know. loserbook. Go Central High Footbal 
 In my opinion this book jumps around way too much and is a little confusing.  It has dialogue for a couple of people, then another couple of people, and then another.  I suggest you take notes to keep up with who everyone is and what is going on 
 There seemed to be no beginning or middle.  No idea if there was an end because I couldn't finish it.  I kept nodding off until one of those "cybernotes" numbers popped up, the ones us gentle readers were superciliously instructed to download early in the book, or have "a friend" download them if we didn't have internet access nor particularly cared.  I got no real sense of time and place despite all the references to clothing, food and what came over Mr. Kane's short-wave.  There was little real content and way too many bloated words. I couldn't like any of the characters at all-- the ones that had any development.  Ruby LaPointe is a self-centered, vain whiner and Jean-Luc is an insufferable know-it-all stuck parenting her.  Anne-Marie barely exists unless she's taking tap-dance lessons or Ruby gets aggravated at her for having the nerve to be sleepy at midnight because Ruby just had to drag the kids to a "dish night" movie on a school night.  Does Anne-Marie even go to school and if so, where?  I probably missed that somewhere in the cloud of bloated words that showed me little.  I glanced at the cybernotes.  I don't recommend reading them unless you want to be textually condescended to and don't mind multiple spelling errors (H.L. Menkin and the Barring Land Bridge?) 
 Since all other reviews are very positive, I'm here to offer a different opinion.  I've had this book for over a year now, and I barely use it. Each time I attempt to find something useful in it, the information is scattered over the entire book making it extremely difficult to understand.  For example, right now I'm looking up the "ref" attribute, and according to the index, it appears on 7 different locations throughout the book, each portion shorter than 1 page. Also, I have seen many tables scattered throughout with exact same information, or one or two differing field values, making it very confusing to understand which table is doing what.  And at over 500 pages long, there is a large amount of filler information in this book.  Is this book "definitive"? It looks like it is. Is this book usable? Absolutely not. This is one of the worst investments I've made in computer books.  And there is a place about strings in the book where it differs from the official W3C specs 
 After chapter after chapter of the gal lamenting over her dead-end romance, she finally buys the house.  Aha, I thought, the story begins.  But alas, not much happens.  Then she finds a picture of her grandmother in the house, and I think, OK here's the story, but not to be.  Then there is the architect that enters - a good love story - no.   Danielle Steel had the makings of three great story lines but failed to develop any of them.  The story of the grandmother's life in the house would have been tremendous.  I think maybe she had a Visa bill to pay and had to get a book out quickly, because she did not put any thought into this one.  Where was the editor on this one?  It was a bummer.  Virgini 
 This book is taken almost word for word in the intro from the movie "Patton" based on Ladislas' book.  It contains typos such as 'D Day' and also does not give any insight into the man.  Connecting Patton to  Deming seems a bit ridiculous to someone with knowledge of the two  men.  Patton did not consider war 'great', per se', and should not be  idolized.  He enjoyed it and was excellent at it, however he agonized over  the men he lost.  Perhaps that is the analogy that businessmen should make  today 
 I have the Bad Cats book and love it, that is why I bought the calendar. I did not realize the pics were in black and white. If I had known that, I would not have bought it. Like another reviewer stated, they should have put that in the description. I would not recommend this calendar. Hopefully next year they will make the pics color or they wont sell many 
 The author seems bent on impressing us with her "literary knowledge" and tosses in quotes for effect. However, the book remains the whining self-important story of one person from a wacked-out family. Grow up and move on. I hope this isn't representative of my proud Italian heritage. I was given this for Christmas and was sorely disappointed 
 I seriously thought I put this toy together all wrong, called the Little Tikes company and expressed my concern about the wobbliness, the toys being either not there or weirdly sharp for a baby. The rep on the phone immediately sent me out a new one, which was awesome. Same deal though!  So the company as a whole is great, seriously amazing! The toy though is not so great. It is wobbly, no matter what position you put it in (and good luck changing the positions!). The toys are sharp even for plastic.  Basically my 21 month old and 7 month old won't look or play with it for more than a minute, rather my older baby uses it to attempt to climb!  I'd stick with Little Tikes anyway, just not recommend this particular toy!  :) 
 That why almost 50% of the book are appendices. You will get the very general big picture, but no more deep knowledge. 
 This book may well have been filled with great writing, however, as a dog owner and lover, I was disgusted and depressed reading these stories.  The reviews on the book cover give little indication as to the repeated  ugliness within.  If you are a parent, imagine reading story after detached  story of babies being killed, lost and neglected.  For me, any great  writing was overshadowed by my sympathies for the dogs.  Not what I  expected and very sad 
 I loved living in 1910 Vienna - the book was wonderfully researched, and was masterful at portraying the characters and times.  And, the mystery grabbed ahold and held on - and seemed like it was really going to have a "whammo" ending.  But no - and don't you feel like you've wasted a bunch of time when that happens.  In this case, the read was interesting enough that I don't feel totally robbed, but disappointed - oh yeah!  Most of all, I was lured by the title and the search for the fig tree, which seemed to gain in significance with each page, only to end in a total fizzle.  We found it - so what?  This book had such potential - what a shame.  Surely someone along the way - agent, editor, publisher - read it and saw its shortcomings.  With all the glowing reviews, one wonders if anybody really read it.  Jody, fire them all and start with a new crew.  You are a great writer and I'll take a shot at your next one 
 I know its silly to judge a book by the tense the author chooses, but I can't stand it when authors write in the present tense. It literally sets my teeth on edge.    So here's my advice - try it you can deal with the tense choice, but if you are like me, avoid this book at all costs.    There is nothing wrong with the plot, the author just needs to get a grip and USE THE PAST TENSE when writing.  
 Kellerman's last few books have been forgettable to say the least and I hoped that this would display the quality of his early writing.  While it was not a total waste of time, it came close.  Far too much print was devoted to the half-hearted team meetings of people in mud colored clothing as they outlined ever more convoluted theories as to who had done what to and with whom.  This  is yet another book that lacks credibility or suspense.  
 I've been running marathons for about 10 years now and never focused my training on diet. I picked up this book in the hopes on finding tips about dieting for runners, but obviously, this book is for walkers, runners. I'm running anywhere between 70 to 100 miles a week and this book is clearly for runners averaging about 15 miles a week. Good book if you're in that camp 
 This book is literally one of the worst I've ever read. Seriously, there is nothing you can get out of it. I don't understand how people can possibly enjoy this book-- I mean, the storyline isn't that bad, but it's just so slow-moving. Plus the main character, Elenor can be so stupid at times it just makes me want to stop reading. (Unfortunately I can't, as it's a school book). If you don't like historical fiction featuring mindless characters, DONT read this book 
 She obviously has little or no interest in the irritating blonde woman who keeps telling her no. Boring movie. Look! Koko knows when someone is taking her picture! So does my pet Chihuahua 
 My husband bought me this for my Birthday.  I suppose it was supposed to be romantic, but it about put me to sleep and definitely out of the mood.  I am not into the swing band era.  Perhaps being born in the seventy's puts me at a disadvantage for appreciating this type of music

 In an attempt to increase the range on my Netgear MR 314 router, I got this WG602 access point but I could not get it to function.  I was told I needed two of them, so I got a second one and I still could not make it work.  I gave up and replace my router with a RangeMax WPN 824 and it is terrific.  Gives me all the range I could want, letting me send and receive at 24 Mbs where the MR 314 would not reach at all. 
 Mona Charen cites nearly every example of demagoguery committed by social liberals from 1960 to 1996.  She didn't miss one.  She bashes liberal views of the Great Society of LBJ, the anti-war protests of the 60's, the welfare state, Clarence Thomas' and Robert Bork's nominations, and the crime wave that quieted in the 90's.  Unfortunately, Charen forgets the similar pandering and hypocrisy that has occurred by social conservatives during that same period, an omission that greatly detracts from her thesis.  Another failing is that she attaches exclusive causeology  of NYC's decrease in crime in the 1990's to Guiliani's get-tough policies, and conveniently forgets the complexities of improved economics, changing demographics and the "abortion factor" (as expounded by Leavitt in Freakonomics) as potential contributors.    She glibly assigns culpability to liberals for any number of social ills including unwed mothers, homelessness, violent crime, racial tension and conceiveably ring-around-the-collar.  Her references are numerous, but her arguments are not careful enough for a scholarly work, so the book serves only as red meat for the angry masses screaming about the same old problems of government waste associated with liberal government bureaucracy.  Charen conveniently avoids the huge government waste associated with the current so-called "conservative" government of GWB and the Republican House and Republican Senate.  Charen forgets to cite the Medicare Part D program as the largest social spending  program (inflation adjusted) in history.  She forgets to mention that GWB signed into law a bill written by fellow "conservative" Republicans that represented the largest farm subsidies (inflation adjusted) in history.  Charen neglects to mention that the current "conservative" government has rushed us into a war that will cost half a trillion dollars and has already lasted longer than WWI, WWII and the US Civil War; and Bush did this despite protests by previous Republican cabinet advisors and diplomats.     At the end of the day, this conservative prefers a government that wastes billions of my tax money on unnecessary and counter-productive social programs over one that spends trillions on unnecessary war and mayhem 
 I love Dr. Seuss, and enjoy reading most of his stories to my 1.5 year old son.  But this book is surprisingly bland.  The illustrations are pitiful, and done mostly in browns.  The story doesn't hold my son's (or my) interest past the first 6 or so pages.  If I'd known this, I would've skipped this book and opted for a more classic Dr. Seuss, such as Green Eggs & Ham 
 it is the worst thing i have ever purchased in my life time of livin 
 This "book" by Cram101 comprises 55 pages that list terms with their definitions. There are no "outlines" as described. Half of the pages are blank, presumably for students' notes. It is not clear how Cram101 chose the terms to define because most of them are not relevant to Research Methods. In addition, many of the definitions provided are not applicable to Research Methods. For example, the term "regression" is defined as a return to an earlier stage of development, when in the context of Research Methods "regression" refers to a statistical concept. There are countless similar examples of terms that are not defined according to the correct Research Methods definition. Anyone who uses this Cram101 book as their main resource will likely flunk their Research Methods course. In addition, the Cram101 (misleading) advertising suggests that Zechmeister, Zechmeister, and Shaughnessy are the authors of the Cram101 book.  These authors wrote the Research Methods in Psychology text (published by McGraw-Hill) which the Cram101 book is said to "accompany," but these authors and publisher have nothing to do with the Cram101 book and do not endorse it 
 The title 'Wake of Death,' new film of Jean-Claude Van Damme, is rightly given to the very violent contents.  Van Damme plays a bouncer Ben Archer who is quitting his job after seeing what he doesn't want to see for 20 years.  But he has a beautiful wife Cynthia (Lisa King, 'Home Alone 4') and a kid at home, and all he wants is just a quiet life.  Anyone who knows some rules about action flicks will detect what will happen to his family when kind-hearted Cynthia (who is an INS officer by the way) takes home a little Chinese girl found among the refugees from China.  And the little girl is connected with a Chinese triad, in fact, a daughter of a ruthless boss Sun Quan (Simon Yam, 'Tomb Raider 2').  And these events occur at the night when Cynthia and Ben are sleeping together in bed, showing part of their bodies in the ill-lit room.  [TYPICAL REVENGE STORY] Yes, Van Damme is getting more and more serious these days, as you have seen 'In Hell' recently.  'Wake of Death' goes similar course, but this time it's a revenge story with more violent actions with shoot-outs and car-chases.  Though the script is a standard one, one inventiveness is found in the relations between Van Damme's hero and his former associates French mafiosos.  These French gangsters give a timely help or two to Van Damme's character in a more bloody fashion than the Italian guys who were seen helping Arnie in 'Eraser.'  So how good is this film?  It depends on your expectaions.  'Wake of Death' shows fairly good car stunts and shoot-outs, but the lack of imagination on the director's side is too obvious.  My opinion is, it is much better than 'Derailed' (his worst), far below 'Timecop' (arguably his best), on par with 'The Order.'  But it's just my idea.  The point is, Van Damme shows pretty good acting here, but the actions, or the logics behind them, look awfully disjointed.  The bad guy's motive to bring back his daughter at any cost is never explained, and the relations between the characters are very confusing.  (Case in point.  You get a glimpse of two veteran actors Burt Kwouk, 'Cato' of 'Rerurn of Pink Panther' and Jacqui Chan, 'The World of Susie Wong,' but the moment they appear on the screen, they get killed, without leaving no impression on us.)  But  most damaging thing is the film's shoddy editing that virtually killed some of the good stunts such as two motorcycles running in a shoppoing mall.  I still do not know what happened at certain point of the story.  Philip Martinez, formerly producer of B action films such as 'Dot Kill' or 'House of 9,' gives his second film as director.  (Incidentally, his first feature was, the imdb   says, 'Citizen Verdict'(03) starring Armand Assante and Jerry Springer!)  As to 'Wake of Death' he decided to shoot this film in South Africa though the story is set in America.  Fans of Van Damme might hail the film as his come-back.  I don't know, for I still fondly remember joyful thrills when I watched his 'Timecop' or 'Universal Soldiers.'  'Wake of Death' is good as Grade-B, straight-to-video actioner, but it's not good enough for me.          
 DO NOT rely on this book to pass the exam. It lightly touches most of the important subjects, but goes nowhere near deep enough to be useful. I agree is it better written that the BCSI book, but it needs to be much more thourough in its handling of the subject matter. Very poor considering its Cisco 
 "Looking Backward" is considered a classic of its type: Utopian literature, which was popular from the sixteenth century into the beginning of the twentieth.  But of course, the vast majority of lives were lived in desperation then, and any escape into a better world was well received.  Bellamy was 31 when this book was published.  As the narrator, he relates his experience of being put into a hypnotic trance as a sleeping aid in 1887 only to be awakened 113 years later, sound of body and mind just as he was when he went to sleep.  But the world has changed to a completely socialistic system.  Bellamy goes into interminable explanations of how the new world operates.  His characters go into long winded, somewhat repetitive, explanations of all phases of this new order.  These tirades become brain numbing in their length and use of archaic words.  I believe it would have been much easier to take if he had made his explanations through dialogues instead of monologues.  And then his character goes out into the world of 2000 Boston.  But, what does he see that's new, different, and exciting?  We never find out, because he doesn't tell us.  In fact, the only new inventions he describes in the entire book are water fountains whose spray works as airconditioners in buildings, awnings hanging over the entire street to keep out rain, pasteboard credit cards, and music and sermons piped into the home through telephone wires.  Too bad he didn't talk with some creative visionaries about what the world might be like in the year 2000, and incorporate some of those concepts in his tale.  He says nothing about changes in fashions, transportation, or any other aspect of his new surroundings.  And there is a glaring error in his utopian world:  He does not take into account human nature.  He glosses this over by claiming that the new socialist order was so successful, that all humans immediately fell into step and laziness, jealousy and greed are no more.  As if that would happen. There is one thought in the entire book I found illuminating.  Paraphrasing here:  Credit can be compared with nothing else but the plight of a man building a house with dynamite for mortar.  With that, I agree.   
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 A highly informative book about viruses, how and why they are spread, in some cases their epidemiology and much about their evolution. Thankfully, very little is given over to speculation here, at least as compared to other books I've read on the subject.  The information in this book is offered in a completely straightforward (and sometimes very boring) way.  You will learn some fascinating new facts, but not have to suffer through scare tactics, just a yawn or two. The book put me to sleep a few times, but was still worth the read. The book contains some interesting viral history and global implications to ponder as well. No entertainment here though, it's just the facts 
 Weber based most of his later works on his first theory of rise of capitalism in Protestant societies. Thus, writing about Indian and Chinese societies he was looking for the reasons for the absence of capitalism in those societies. He concluded that Asian religions are so irrational and other-worldly that they are simply incapable of producing industrial capitalism which is based on rational, secular and this-worldly social ethics.   This conclusion itself has problems vis-?-vis Weber's "objectivity of the social scientist." Successful capitalism in "traditional" Shinto and Buddhist Japan and many other ASEAN countries seem to have already disproved Weber's conclusions that capitalism can arise only in Protestant societies.   My point is not to highlight the capitalist successes of Asia, but just that the purely objective research has its own problems. If we apply Weber's advocacy of "objectivity" in his own writings, we clearly see that his own subjective Western background has influenced his observations and conclusions.   In his zeal to prove Asian religions as other-worldly and mystic, he ignores the great materialistic pursuits of Asia in ancient and medieval times.   On the one hand, Weber argues that intellectual life should relate to some human interest, but on the other hand it should be "objective" rather than mere ideology.  So the objectivity is always relative to some particular interest or project that scholars might have. Weber prescribes his grand vision to researchers but does not seem to practice himself accurately. He is unable to be truly objective because of the subtle political presuppositions he makes about Asian religions 
 there are many reasons to rip apart this movie, there are enough holes that even NEW YORK rats could go through.  however, what this movie lacks, it makes up for with a nice presentation, bonus features and really good special effects.  the story is slim-unstable serum.  there is govermental paranoia, rediculous chases, cheese nudity, a slight look of HALLOWEEN(from the persons POV)--sort of DARKMAN look and feel to the actors in their roles, several nice killings and the typical no brainer ending(SEQUEL) hmmn?, the movie company was lucky it was filming on a dark dreary rainy days!!-lol.  movie is not bad. its better than most if you want to be entertained.   just try not to get too involved.  RENT IT.  
 I was attracted to the author's premise for this book, as I have recently been struggling with the conflicting moral perspectives from which colleagues can view the same issue.  But I found the book too confusing, and couldn't find compelling support for the author's hypotheses.    The book is framed as a Socratic dialogue among characters.  Although this style seemed plausible, the characters' personalities were not developed enough for me to distinguish them and identify them with their arguments.  Overall, the author's plausible premise was not supported clearly by illustration or research and I remain un-persuaded. 
 This 1/4" thick, 4x6 index card of a book touts itself as a "take-no-prisoners" exposé when it is, in fact, merely a collection of random "shocking" trivia. Sadly, the few real bombshells that the book DOES contain are overwhelmed by the hyperbolic tone of the rest.  Here are the bombshells, facts that might make us seriously re-evaluate our relationship with those in power:  - The US is Planning to Provoke Terrorist Attacks - Kent State Wasn't the Only---or Even the First---Massacre of College Students During the Vietnam Era - Juries are Allowed to Judge the Law, Not Just the Facts - The Government Can Take Your House and Land, Then Sell Them to Private Corporations - Prescription Drugs Kill Over 100,000 Annually - Work Kills More People Than War  The quality of the other 44 topics ranges from moderately interesting yet trivial ("Adolf Hitler's Blood Relatives are Alive and Well in New York State" and "The Virginia Colonists Practiced Cannibalism") to no-brainers such as "Advertisers' Influence on the News Media is Widespread." There is no consistent theme linking the 50 disparate "things you're not supposed to know," other than the fact that they are "supposed" to be secrets, but that assertion is pure hyperbole. After all, all it takes to find out that  the Korean War never ended, that nuclear war almost broke out in 1995,  or that LSD was a used as a powerful adjunct to psychotherapy, is a glance at Wikipedia, hardly a repository of repressed esotericism.  This is a pretty good place to start learning "secret" information if you're still embedded in the indoctrination factory we call junior high or high school, and it admittedly makes for decent bathroom reading, but those interested in real bombshells would do well to look elsewhere 
 I too am missing the usb adapter as well as the hand strap & cradle.  I cannot down load my images to my computer and burn through batteries in less than one day.  I can't find replacement parts anywhere on the web or in stores to make my camera functional.  I am so disappointed with this purchase.  My local drug store can't down load the XD card and I will have to go to a store in another town just to empty the card and burn it to a CD.  Don't even think of buying a fuji product as they won't help me either 
 There are certain elements to Star Wars storytelling.  Two of the many being action, and an intriguing antagonist.  That is why Episode IV opens with an Imperial Starship chasing a rebel blockade-runner.  That is why we find ourselves gasping "ooooh, aaaah" when we see Darth Vader march through the white corridoors of that pivotal first scene.  Triple Zero lacks both of these elements.  Key characters such as Skirata, Darman, and Etain are well developed.  I found myself genuinely caring for them.  But the suspenseful EVENTS that should surround key characters are absent in Triple Zero.  The Commandos are placed in Coruscant, supposedly battling face-less terrorists.  However, most of the storytelling revolves around arsenal buildup, Mando culture, and simply waiting.  I read from page 1-244 and skipped 100 pages to 346.  I finished the book without missing  a thing.  I rate the first Republic Commando 5 stars.  Excellent read.  But Triple Zero lacks the suspense to keep me coming back.  Republic Commando: Triple Zero should've been named Republic Commando: Zero Antagonists 
 I regret buying this book.  It covers a lot of material but has very little about each item.  If you really need the detail look elsewher 
 But why glorify such subject matter? The Academy holds this movie up as a high-point of artistic achievement. Getting to know the workings of a psychotic mind can enrich you life, apparently 
 This book has some great ideas, but some of the cakes shown and described are actually character scenes, the base of which are the actual cakes, and the decorations are almost all sculptures made of fondant or marzipan. (I  didn't even know what those were until lately.) Although I did admire  Debbie Brown's talent and expertise, the techniques used and suggested were  VERY intimidating. What ever happened to old fashioned butter cream  frosting and decorator bags? I guess if you're into modeling clay, though,  you could get some good ideas from this book 
 This book is more of a magazine (with advertisements!).  While it has many cute pages that parents have made with a photo or two, the descriptions of how each page was done are only useful for people who have enough scrapbooking experience to recognize the brief and sometimes obscure references to paper and lettering sources.  There are almost no explanations of how the pages were created (no step by step instructions or tips or anything) except to identify the sources of the products used.  A big disappointment 
 Bennett makes few if any good points in this book about the problems our culture faces.  Most of the book is spent showing how many people were "critics" and how he showed them who was boss.  Bennett criticizes anyone who wishes to include diversity in the American life: through "controversial" art which he deems a "bad joke" simply because it may shock viewers, through a desire for schooling that does not impose Christian ideals upon its students by force, through courses that don't only include dead white men of the western world, etc.  Bennett's argument is that his racist, homophobic, beauraucratic, Christian-supremicist version of morality is the only feasible one and must be imposed upon all children in any institution of education.  He spends most of the book laughing off his critics and indignantly ignoring any of their points, casting them off as just being jealous that their plans aren't as good as his.  Yet he thinks vouchers will help poor students, that an abolishment of affirmative action will help minorities, and that "beheading" drug dealers is morally plausible.  The section on drugs has a little bit of insight, but the books few good points are obscured by his blatant arrogance and conservative ideals 
 Unless you look like Popeye and/or have the ability to rip phone books in half with your bare hands, you will struggle to wring this mop out. Even if you can move the wringer, the handle sections slide apart. I spent more time putting it back together and cursing than actually cleaning the floor 
 A very boring and stupid film about college freshmen with a kindergarten maturity level. The movie is horribly slow to get to the point and is riddled with nonsense dialogue: I've heard better lines in 'Fast Times At Richmond High' thank you.    Altogether a very forgettable film that has a lot of talk about nothing. Don't believe the great reviews about this film: the film might appeal to the 14-17 year-old crowds fantasizing about how 'cool' college life might be with all the 'cool' people and 'parties.' If you're not in that category, skip this boring film and save both your time and your money.    
 Years after its release I find myself writting what I consider a completely biast review for this film (being somewhat of a Star Wars fan had made it difficult to look at it with any negative light before). Let me first start by saying that my two daughters love the film. For me, I grew up watching the original Star Wars (now titled Episode IV, A New Hope). When the original Star Wars came out, it changed the way people looked at Sci-Fi. I saw it several times just to be able to focus on the different aspects of the sets, props, costumes, etc. It was the best eye-candy of its time by far. Substance became less of an important factor and if the movie had a couple of "holes" in the story we forgave it and watched-on mesmerized by its visual splendor and the likability of its characters. Almost thirty years later the panorama is completely different. Star Wars movies still hold the bar for special effects but in a computer-generated world, amazing visuals ocurr within any television comercial, even the lowest budget Sci-Fi television show has special effects that are somewhat convincing or at least cool to look at. Effects do not make a movie and "Attack of the Clones" is more about effects than story or even acting for that matter. Awfully silly dialogue doesn't help it neither. In retrospect, I wish that George Lucas would have come up with two completely different droids than C3PO and R2D2 (the latter even flies! Imagine that, more capabilities than in the future). This premise is even absurd for the world of Star Wars. According to the story, Luke Skywalker and his uncle Owen in episode four bought two droids that are about thirty to forty years old. As I'm typing this review I can imagine myself typing it with a Royal ribbon typewriter, that just wouldn't happen. It is scary to find things that are even too far-fetched for the world that Lucas created but the movie is full of them. He doesn't really give any explanation in the whole trilogy (I,II,III) as to why in the future the ships are not as cool or look and act clunkier, or why everything looks dated thirty years from now. In his world technology goes backwards and not the other way around. I, however have a solution for all these. George Lucas should keep meddling with the original trilogy until all that is left from the original films is the faces of the protagonists. Everything else should be computer re-generated in order to keep pace with a future more in sync with its past. Then, you could buy all versions of the original trilogy (IV,V,VI). As originally shot, the revised version that we all saw in re-release on the theaters, and the "Ultimate Enhanced Version" to better match the second trilogy (I,II,III). Maybe he could even re-edited where the actors look as if they had no personalities and change the dialog to sound more confusing. Then, you would have a whole set of six films that look fantastic but lack in every other aspect of story telling (ie., compelling characters, continuity, interesting plotlines, etc). The only reason I give the movie two stars is because the wonderful effects created by ILM still makes the film worth watching at least once. Otherwise, I rather watch "Serenity" which has a more Star Wars feel to it than this Star Wars film. The nickname of "Mannequin" to "Annakin" is well-deserved as it is any negatives regarding the characters of this poorly told story 
 Robin Hobb knows how to write well and proved it with Assassin's Apprentice. Unfortunately, she seems to be in love with her descriptive prose and forgets mundane items such as plot, action, and likable (or at least interesting) characters. Ship of Magic suffers from an excess of flowery prose adorning a dull, meandering story containing uninteresting and mostly unlikable characters. I read a quarter of the book and stopped. Some of the (mostly glowing) reviews claim that the book gets better, but my patience dwindled to naught.  Specific things I disliked:  1. Another Hobb book in which magic but inanimate objects (the wood of the liveship) come to life only after multiple people (three generations of ship owners, in this book) die while touching the object. Can't her magic creatures have lives and personalities of their own?  2. Teens and young adults rarely learn from mistakes and repeatedly act stupid. (Maybe they are all budding politicians.)  3. The interwoven story of sea serpents from some other plane of existence is distracting because of lack of context. It probably will make sense later, but it adds nothing but confusion in the early chapters. Hobb should have started the book at the middle or near-end of the story (so we would know the importance of the serpents and the liveships) and then gone back in time.  4. The members of the main family are mostly unlikable. The only likable one has unrealistic lines: the 13-year-old acolyte talks like a 50-year-old philosopher 
 Wow, this is what passes as humour?  I love Arrested Development, David Sedaris, Augusten Burroughs so I thought I would find this book funny.  The author is annoying and tries to make everything funny when it is not.  I feel bad for the people that have to deal with her.  Her idea of a punchline/resolution is pathetic.  I can't believe she is as popular as she is.  Waste of money 
 It doesn't look as pictured and has a hollow sound, even if it is a beginner childrens guiter 
     I read a good short story by Franzen in The New Yorker a couple years ago, but this book is lame, lame, lame.  The essays contain little to no humor or insight- they are just lengthy, boring opinions on various subjects.  Imagine if you can a duller, less-relavant Andy Rooney.  If I wanted to read some loser's uninspired musings, I would get on the internet and start reading weblogs.  I hereby declare this book Unreadable 
 The theme is interesting enough - an American inmate of a British lunatic asylum contributes much to the creation of OED.  Unfortunately the book doesn't have much beyond the outline of the theme.  As some other reviewers have noted, it would have made a decent magazine article, but instead it is filled out to book length with repetition, semi relevant trivia, and melodramatic hyperbole of the "superior" Victorian English kind 
 I absolutely loved the Left Behind series...some installments more than others, of course, but it will always remain one of my favorite series. At first I was excited to hear that they were going to write prequels...a chance to get to see how the characters in Left Behind became who they were, and all that...but after getting a few chapters into the book, I was struck by how boring it all was. Also, it felt like the authors went a little too into detail about some of the Satanic stuff...but maybe that was just me.  Despite my disappointment with The Rising, I will probably continue to read the prequels; one can only hope that it gets better from here 
 I had always wanted to read something by Eudora Welty, and this book cured me of that.  What a confusing bunch of characters--one didn't know if they were white or black--young or old.  The one bright spot in the book was her very descriptive language 
 From start to finish, New X-men: Imperial is overly ambitious and overly melodramatic.  The themes, for the most part, are the same tried ideas of tolerance and prejudice.  All X-men comics revolve around these same ideas, but the hard part is putting a new spin on them, and unfortunately their use in Imperial felt stale, generic, and overblown.  Imperial (New X-men #118-#126) continues the saga of the struggle against Cassandra Nova, an immensely powerful being who has hijacked Xavier's body, trapped his mind, and then left to sabotage the Shi-ar empire.  Meanwhile, the X-men must deal with an organization that is harvesting mutants for their organs and face increasing public scrutiny since Xavier revealed his mutant identity.  The outcome and revelation of Cassandra, her identity, her past, and eventually her defeat, came off as very B-movie-ish.  There was a barrage of newer characters, and although I had read volume 1 (E is for extinction), they didn't seem adequatly explained, making me wonder if I was supposed to read another series in conjunction.  The weak plot would be acceptable, were it not for the bizarre art that accompanies it.  I respect the editors for trying to lend diversity to X-men's looks by bringing in different artists, but the end-result is just not very pleasing in Imperial.  X-mens' faces are so dowsed in character lines that they are downright ugly and deformed at times, and their faces completely change appearance from frame to frame.    The final blow is that the layout of the action in the frames is so cluttered that I had no idea what was going on most of the time.  I had to repeatedly examine some frames to try to figure out what was trying to be conveyed.  Is that Wolverine or Beast?  Is that supposed to be a head?  What just happened here?    I have been trying to get into the newer incarnations of our favourite gene-freaks.  I must confess that I really don't care for the general direction in the New X-men series.  I don't like their costumes, I don't like their "second-mutations," and I'm not even a big fan of the roster in New X-men.  But it's not that I'm just a stubborn old fart who refuses to accept change.  I had vastly enjoyed the Uncanny X-men novels (circa issue #400), but I can't say the same about New X-men Imperial 
 This book is an innaccurate version of events in the the discovery of teh structure of DNA. What most people don't know is that Rosalind Franklin was crucial to the discovery of the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick actually stole most of her data via Wilson, her supervisor, adn passed it off as their own discoverery.  She was a brilliant scientist and should have been an independent researcher at Kings College, but because she was a woman she was made an assistant to Wilson. She was extremely dedicated and plowed through all the obstacles at Kings College. However, her supervisor, Wilson, showed most of her data to his old friend Crick, who shared it with his partner Watson. They too were studying DNA, although they were on completely wrong track. The data that was pilfered included the famous photo 51, which Franklin obtained over a course of years' work and revealed the spiral shape of DNA. They also positioned the competent of DNA, such as the bases, exactly as she hypothesized. Watson, Crick, and Wilson received the Nobel Prize, while Franklin could not, because she died at the age of 38 due to radiation exposure from the X-rays she used to capture photo 51. The men only mentioned her in passing when accepting their prize, and definitely not as the source of the actual discovery. Then Watson had the gall to write a book that casts her in a horrible light, as an inferior person who was bad tempered and selfishly hoarded her information. He also calls her `Rosy' throughout the entire book, although she despised that name. He once even went up to Rosalind and demanded that she hand over her data. He was a complete bigot, and thought her inferior and was furious when she refused to share her own findings to him. He harps about her appearance in the book, and it is obvious that is the only way he perceives her, and not as a thinking person. And for the record, she was actually quite striking, and wore the latest in French fashions. She was extremely dedicated, and her level of determination would have been completely accepted in a man. That's why I give this book a one, and if I could I'd give it a zero. Watson is just begging for comeuppance for what he wrote in this book. I would reccomend reading other books about Rosalind's struggle, such as 'Rosalind Franklin: The dark lady of DNA' 
 I was expecting a thoughtful assessment of the challenges that lie ahead.  What I got was the musings of a bitter old man who seems to hate everything about contemporary American society and is cheering for its imminent demise.  I knew the book wasn't going to be cheery or optimistic, but this was way too depressing.  I don't need this kind of nay-saying pessimisim in my life 
 To my surprise this is a live recording rather than the orginal songs.   For instance the "London___Blues" is not GP Nunn but JJ himself.   Not all bad but certainly not what I expected 
 I picked this book up last week at a homeschool convention.  My oldest son is very interested in history and learning about the explorers.  We have enjoyed books by this author before, so I felt like it was a good buy.  I can't believe how blatantly anti-Christian the author is in this book.  She makes Christians sound like the wart of the world!  She makes it sound like the world progressed in knowledge and achievements in spite of Christianity.  Although I am no history expert, some of her statements just didn't sit well with me, and I would really question whether what she wrote is fact or just her ignorant, prejudiced opinion.  I will never purchase another book by her again 
 Another reviewer, Mick Black from Cleveland had it right. The video skipped and stopped cold on a few episodes. I carefully cleaned the disks, and the same thing happened. It's a shame one of the great shows off all time is not given it's proper respect by Universal. I didn't expect a lot of "extras," just the original episodes with no frills or technical problems. No such luck 
 Why is it ever time you want something bad enough it usually turns out bad? After the wonderful Quinn trilogy fans (including me) begged and begged for Nora Roberts to write Seth's story. After all we journeyed with Seth through we wanted to see him fall in love. Nora Roberts repeatedly said she would not write one. But us fans kept on begging for it and were excited when she finally gave in and wrote it. And we got Chesapeake Blue. Reading it you know you should be grateful because you wanted Seth's story but....this wasn't what I (and my fellow NR fans friends) wanted. First of all I wanted the heroine to be Aubrey. After their beautiful friendship in the Quinn trilogy I expected her to be Seth's love interest. But I tried to keep an open mind after all I loved Anna, Grace, and Sybill, but Dru Whitcomb Banks was a completely let down. All she did was whine and complain about her life which were minor compared to what Cam, Ethan, Philip, and Seth experienced as children. Seth becoming an artist was a surprise too I expected him to join the family business and design boats. The Gloria blackmailing him was a very thin and bad plotline. There's no reason Gloria would want to contact him considering all the warrents for her and that Seth wouldn't tell his family considering the Quinn Brothers (and wives)worked their so hard to keep him away from her. I closed this book vowing never to request, beg or petition an author to write a book when they say they don't want to. Because this is what you get 
 After using the scale for the first time, the body fat percentage showed at 26.6%. I have had my body fat tested professionally and I am around 20%. I know that body fat testing is not an exact science however; I feel that a 6.6% discrepancy is extreme 
 I've read all four of the new Necromunda books that have come out and this has to be the worst of the four. While I appreciate the point of having multiple plot lines running all at once to play off of one another, it's clumsily done in this book. The larger purpose of why the curator goes into the Underhive doesn't appear until the very end -- and is absolutely at odds with why HE thinks he's going...which smacks of the author not being able to wrap things up neatly. I can appreciate plots that come to a halt abruptly - this is best done in the Mad Donna book 'survival instinct' - but spending all those pages on subplots that are little more than atmospherics detracts from the main storyline. The book is not served by lengthy descriptions of life as an Escher or Goliath ganger...these just muddy the waters. Read this book only if you can buy it used and are hellbent on reading them all. 
 While "Riot Act" (2002) is probably the bands most strongest album yet, the tour that followed definitley was not.  Onstage Pearl Jam don't even look like themselves anymore, well at least on the 2003 tour. The deliverence and shoegazing performance leave so much to be desired, its only a worse follow on from the 2000 american tour where the band looked exhuasted and bored, after what looked like a pretty impressive previous European tour of the same year.  Probably the reason is that the band are't 21 anymore, and have become slack.  Hopefully with rehearsals, eating properly, and new inspiration they will make their next tour back to their best, and end this drudge which has made them look silly in recent times.  Don't buy this, their last decent tour was 1998 or Europe 2000, so one day hopefully we will see a DVD from those times or prior to that.  New album soon......... 
 Provides a summary treatment of this subject, but a book I like better is "Unlocking the Value of Your Business", which seems to be more complete, but easy to use and understand 
 THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT STATE WHAT THEY USE FOR THE RED COLORING IN  THEIR NECTAR.  IT IS A WELL KNOWN FACT THAT RED DYE #40 HAS PROVED HARMFUL TO HUMMINGBIRDS CAUSING CANCER AND IS NOT NECESSARY.  NATURAL NECTAR IN THE WILD IS CLEAR WITHOUT COLOR.  USING A COLORFUL FEEDER WILL ATTRACT THE HUMMERS AND NOT HARM THEM.  
 While I have no doubt of Sting's genuine admiration and love for Dowland's music, the performances here simply will not do. He has obviously learned the notes very carefully, and he does make it through each of these challenging songs...but just barely.  Never do any of these performances really take off and soar and become true interpretations.  The entire enterprise remains firmly earthbound and doggedly "note-for-note" in its approach.  To be fair, subtlety and nuance never have a chance with the all-too-close "pop" miking of Sting's voice, which makes it sound like he and the excellent lutenist Edin Karamazov weren't even in the same room when performing. Moreover, Sting's proclivity for nasal vocal production and oddly colored vowels tend to render the highly poetic texts almost unintelligible.  Add to this Sting's hokey "Masterpiece Theatre"-style readings from a letter of John Dowland to Sir Robert Cecil, chief adviser to Elizabeth I, and some ill-advised multitracking effects, and the whole experience quickly becomes unlistenable.  In which case, I won't carp about the disc's rather meager running time of 48 minutes, since even at that short measure, it seems much longer.  I'm just glad I didn't shell out for the disc; I borrowed it from my local lending library, and it goes back at the end of the week 
 ok i hate disney and than they come out with this craptastic piece of crap?! 
 I previously attempted to use this device with my Mac Pro.  I run the machine with Windows XP and Mac OS X Tiger.  With Tiger, the machine refuses to sleep when the hub is plugged into my Aluminum Cinema Display.  Simply unplug the D-Link hub, and the machine happily goes to sleep.  With Windows XP, the machine does not recognize my Microsoft Ergo Keyboard 4000 until I disconnect the keyboard from the hub, then reconnect it.  Ironically, the keyboard works fine under OS X when connected to the D-Link Hub.  I guess I got what I paid for.  A piece of junk 7 port hub for under $30.  I have reverted back to using my 2x4 Port "hockey puck" style Belkin USB 2.0 Hubs.  No problems with those 
 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Julia Roberts and Richard Gere should have given every cent they received on this movie for charity! Horrible acting and plot. Julia and Richard, I hope you get to read this one day. 
 The audio is delivered in a monotone that almost puts you to sleep. Not a good thing while drivin 
 An especially disturbing book because it provides management who wish to do so with a pseudo-scientific pretext for using fear as a tool against their fellow members of the organization. Additionally, these ideas applied promote factionalization among organizational members, which increases complexity by causing people to work for a subset, rather than the whole of an organization. This is encouragement to compete rather than cooperate. If this work were written by a foreign writer, I would guess that it's intent was to help perpetuate international business superiority by giving North American management poor, neo-Tayloristic ideals wrapped (warped) in an attractive package and presented as new thinking. Fear as a motivation is a tool of the insipient, including self-serving management. Management by Fear should find the same way as Taylorism, Management by Objective and other idiotic management principles, onto the old heap of intellectual rubbish we should be embarassed of. For constructive management theory, read about Japanese conglomerates we buy most of our better products from, or explore W.E. Deming's Profound Changes 
 This movie was a huge disappointment and waste of money. The movie dragged on forever to set-up the story line and then quickly went down hill with a series of poorly written pesduo-love mishaps. Boring and painfully is the best this movie has to offer. Do yourself a favor and save your money 
 The first chapter was great, ... but then the rest of the book felt like a fictional story. This book does not portray the events of Royal Rife very effectively, and the author's attempt to put himself into the classics of the Rife story has failed to impress me. I think there are better ways to tell the story than leading the reader on a fantasy tale 
 This book is about the rise of the House of Rothschild but it is not written for the casual reader of history.  This is written for the scholar whose subject matter is economic history.  As that is not my field of study, I found the book boring in the extreme (it took me two months to wade through it).  However, for the student of Jewish history, it does have some interesting ideas as to the origins of some of the Nazi propaganda 
 A dashing swashbuckler, Captain Alatriste, champions the cause of a young woman who has been forced into sexual slavery in a priest's home in the days of the Spanish Inquisition. At the heart of her trial is the issue of her heritage; she is of Hebrew descent. In the course of his struggle with the prejuidices holding not only an innocent girl captive, but a nation, the captain relives his own memories of the time he was a subject of the horrors and how afraid he was.   ** Though historically illuminating and shocking, the seesawing back and forth between memory and present narrative hampers the flow of the novel. However, if you have an interest in that period of history, this may not prove annoying to you. **   Amanda Killgor 
 Okay, I'm a sucker for a good sob story that pulls at the heartstrings. Unfortunately, this didn't do it. I own many of the Chicken Soup books and this one in particular had the potential for hitting the zenith of Chicken-Soup-ish-ness. But the stories seemed fake, not particularly heartwarming, and contrived. 
 We've had this for about five years.  The battery went dead but THERE IS NO WAY TO CHANGE THE BATTERY.  The battery is soldered to the circuit board!  They expect you to ship it back to the factory which will probably cost $20 each way!  I opened it up, cut out the old battery, and duct-taped a new battery in there but it just comes loose every few months.  Cooks rice great, though 
 (Hey, this review is supposed to be 5 stars! What's up with the editing?)   O. K.   Get ready.   Take a ...deeeeeeep ....breath.....   This book, written in 1991, is about to become relevant again!  Yergin's "hydrocarbon man" is alive and well and living in the 21st century.  No book has ever captured the excitement, risk, and reward of the oil business like this volume does. Daniel Yergin documents oil patch history, from the simple beginnings as a native american medicine to todays complex international traffiking.  Truely, hydrocarbon extraction from the subsurface is the stuff of modern life.  Try to live without the carbon-hydrogen bond and you'll find out what life is like with an odd-even social-security-number lottery for the gas chamber. (Maybe I exaggerate a bit, but trust me... you don't want to look down this road.)  My advice:  Buy this book!   Buy it today!   Read it as soon as you receive it!   The next day may be too late!    (As I write this, gasoline prices rose today by about 8 cents because of the Alaskan pipeline.)     Also, thank your local geologist. And buy him a beer 
 What's remarkable is how much gall and bravado it takes to defend a failed economic perspective AFTER it's been tested and proven wrong. Bartley, of course, was one of the chief proponents of "supply-side" economics, an extreme right-wing attitude toward economic policy that had little to do with solid economics, or indeed economic theory at all, so much as an attitude toward government and capitalism.  Even Milton Freidman, who had many valid initial points about the constraints on growth resulting from excessive taxes and over-regulation, or the delayed effects of federal monetary policy, never went this far... and non-economists like Bartley and Laffer were pretty much alone in their claims about the "magic of the marketplace" generating increased revenues by lowering taxes.  The sad thing is that, even though serious economists never bought into or supported the "supply side" concept, it didn't really matter to cranks like Bartley: their purpose was superficial populism and public-opinion essays to drum up right-wing support. And, of course, that resulted in the great Reagan-era "experiment"--which was (let's not forget) an unqualified failure by any measure.  Bartley would like to pretend otherwise--understandably, since he was largely responsible for this era of economic catastrophe. But to claim with a straight face that the supply-side policies of the 80s resulted in faster growth is simply ludicrous. Supply-side tax cuts generated a hideous and unprecedented peacetime deficit, a loss of federal revenues, a widened gap between rich and poor, and _slower_ growth. These are indisputable facts. If anyone had suggested this experiment with a full awarenss of the inevitable consequences for our society, they would be condemned as inhumane sociopaths.  But like any crackpot, Bartley isn't impressed with mere facts. You can always tell a far-right crackpot by their willingness to ignore not only the knowledge of those who've actually made their careers studying the field (i.e., "that darn ol' academia"), but also the real-world results of their tested and failed policies.  Supply-side was a disastrously bad idea with no intellectual foundation (not even among monetarists of the Friedman/Chicago school). It proved to be a complete failure. That alone should be enough to ensure that no one ever listens to Bartley again, let alone takes seriously the idea that these policies should be tried again.  But like the Evil Dead, the old supply-side notions of "tax cuts for growth" have never died in the minds of the frenetic faithful at the Wall Street Journal. So we're still dealing with this idiocy today, long after a trial run should have discredited this foolishness once and for all 
 Jane Austen's last novel, published posthumously, receives this year's Clunky Boring Classic Award.  Anne Elliot, on the verge of spinsterhood at 27, is reunited with the man she let her friends talk her out of when was 19.  Lauded by the literary types as exemplifying Austen's wit and irony, it's really just a simplistic romance in which all characters spend far too much ink flapping their gums 
 This is okay but it is not the sterling brilliant work Charlap does on his three previous efforts at all. Get any of those instead of this one. Get Stardust. Get Somewhere. Get Written in the Stars. Any and all of those three instead of this one. Another warning...this Gershwin one has the annoying Copy Control demon on it so when you load it onto your mp3 it skips and jumps. most annoying. whatever happen to fair use by people who buy the music??? 
 I like most of Jodi Picoult's books, but this was the worse one I have ever read. The story line was ridiculous and unbelievable. The main character in the book, Trixie, is a teenager with problems but her parents never seem to realize this. They go to incredible lengths to protect her and never hold her responsible for any of her actions. The drawings in the book were distracting and annoying. I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 Would that the producers would have spent their time and energy on season SIX, SEVEN, and EIGHT of this truly great Britcom series than to waste their time producing this overview of past glories.  AS TIME GOES BY is by my way of thinking the BEST of all the Britcoms that have come across the pond.  GIVE US THE REMAINING SEASONS rather that this "Best of . . ." abbreviation.  It may be a good introduction for those who have not seen the series on TV but your money is better spent on buying one of the seasons already available on DVD or catching whatever you local PBS station may be using as a filler in its broadcasting schedule.  Go for the full blown series, you won't be disappointed 
 So irritating to hear these guys paint radio rock with a thin layer of metal, using the deteriorating skeleton of the "Soilwork sound" as a brush. So pitiable to hear Bjorn awkwardly [attempt to] hit notes outside his vocal range. So ironic the album cover is proportional to the music in terms of boringness.  Oh, but then there's "Blind Eye Halo," the obligatory pseudo-thrash snoozer. The inclusion of this song means Soilwork are as great as ever, evidently. Too bad the drug industry could sell bits of this song to cure insomnia.  Basically, this album is fail. Try Chainheart Machine and A Predator's Portrait, those albums were Soilwork's peak 
 Jesus, talk about the little girl crying "wolf." When I picked up this book, I expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with. What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption.   The book starts out promisingly, even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose. We're given the account of Charles Monet, one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus. From there on, Preston gives a description of the virus, what it does, how it does it - the works. Then, he moves on to the Human Component, the cast of characters, so to speak, for the big story.  The big story is, alas, not so impressive. It's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about, but nothing of the sort happens. Basically, people run around in bio-hazard gear, fret a lot, and monkeys die. In between, Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus, cases of people being infected, "crashing and bleeding out," cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys, unless you're a PETA type.  The worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is. He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book, which is a noble idea, but not when they don't die at the end. Basically, he's trying to make you care about these people, and all for naught. And by the time that you're supposed to be truly concerned, you actually WANT them to die, because you're tired of hearing about him describe, in active detail, what they eat in the morning, what they do in the afternoon, and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night. When you're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus, why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaax's hands and karate prowess? Moreover, when you've finally gotten to the monkeys, why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild? Does anyone really care?  I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis, but I can't. Preston's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions, but he instead chose to "get into the minds" of his subjects. And what a bore that became. There were only two redeeming aspects of this book: one was the description of the African, human Ebola victims, and the other was the description of the virus itself, although, again, both were sabotaged by Preston's inability to write.   If you want to know something about Ebola, go get An Idiot's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics. If you're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element, read The Hot Zone. Personally, I like to avoid rereading the Uncle Tom's Cabins of scientific accounting 
 The cover of this collection of classic TV themes makes it look like it's a winner, but when you see the track listing and listen to the compilation overall, it's very disappointing.    The collection has gathered popular TV theme songs but there are so many that you do want that are not here:  Facts of Life, Different Strokes, Maude...a lot of the kitschy songs are omitted, preventing this from becoming a true guilty pleasure.   Stick with the Television Themes series.  Much better!   
 I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers.  But this story is just way too slow.  Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again.  I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner.  About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel.  
 If you are interested in a critical review of the Biotech issues, this is NOT the book for you. If you are searching for arguments against GMO', big business, and pro big government; you have found a source. Daniel Charles has hidden neither his bias nor his ignorance of the subject. He draws on old studies (Monarch Butterfly larvae) and does not discuss the latest findings, because the latest findings do not support his position. He hangs adjutives on employees of the business world to ensure the reader knows they are "evil". The ineptness of big government is never addressed. Having served as a military officer, I can tell you that if the military had been as one-sided in dealings with Mr Charles' employer (NPR), the military would have been brought to task... It is a shame we have not discovered the gene to improve critical thinking, Mr. Charles soarly needs the modification 
 *WARNING!!! This critique contains major spoilers!*  Sometimes I wonder if I read a different book than everyone else, that just happens to have the same title.  Everybody seems to love this book, but I really hated it. The basic story idea was good enough, but the ending came off to me as a cop out because Dekker just couldn't thing of anything else to write. Also, am I the only one who noticed the big plot hole that the ending created?  The girl that turned out to be a figment of the main guy's imagination, was in earlier parts of the story, without him, conversing with other characters.  How can a figment of one man's imagination be so involved with other people?  That just really bugged me. Now on to the cheesy, cheesy, freaking cheesy dialog. My pet peeve in any book or movie is cheesy dialog. I can't stand it. First of all, let me say, I think it's wonderful that this guy doesn't use profanity. But what was with the ridiculous insults he used in place of the curse words. If you don't want to call someone a $^!/head, God bless you, but come on "toilet water," "squat."  Jerk would have worked just fine.  Or, who says that you have to use any insults at all. Bottom line, I thought this book was really stupid, and because of it, I am very hesitant to ever read anything else written by Ted Dekker.  I'll just read John Grisham, and mark over the swear words with a sharpie 
 I have never reviewed a product before but this time I have to. Joss Stone is a great singer and artist but this DVD is absolutely unviewable. The camera never stays on anything for more than 3 seconds and it is almost never on the artist the camera shakes and it is truly impossible to view. Do yourself a favor and buy the CD because the music is great but the DVD is useless 
 An 18th century author writing about the dark ages. It reads more like incidents within a narrative rather than a single story.  I found the ending abrupt and not credible. I expected more of the creator of Sherlock Holmes 
 Those of you who don't think that there is anything particularly wrong with just how much McCoy errs in this book dishonour the very people that you only claim to honour.  You ought to be ashamed of yourselves...but not half so much as McCoy for tossing out this rubbish just to make a quick quid by riding the newest wave of 'Celtomania' 
 The World Trade Organization's 1999 meeting in Seattle has already gone down in history as the Battle of Seattle. Instead of discussing international trade issues, the participants looked on in horror as gangs of protesters wrecked the center of Seattle. Instead of sipping coffee in Starbuck's, they watched as the rioters gutted every Starbuck's outlet they could find.  For some reason that this weighty book does not fully explain, people who protest against the WTO seem to hate Starbuck's.   The Institute for International Economics, which published this book, is probably above such venalities. Its Board of Directors includes some of the world's most influential figures including Conrad Black, Miguel de la Madrid, Nigel Lawson, Lee Kwan Yew, Paul O'Neill, David Rockefeller, Paul Krugman, George Schulz and even Alan Greenspan himself. Taken as a group, they certainly know their way around the corridors of power.  That being so, it is a pity that they do not seem to be able to write well. The book is a rather turgid discussion of the issues that should have been aired at Seattle. Spokespeople for the United States, the European Union and the world's other major economic powers are each given a separate chapter to themselves. So too are such less than inspiring topics as intellectual property, anti-dumping legislation and electronic commerce. If nothing else, the book will suit economics professors looking for additional dull readings to inflict upon their unsuspecting students.  Only two chapters enliven this otherwise comatose book. Surprisingly enough perhaps, the first of these is by Hisamitsu Arai from Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). He begins by telling us that the Japanese delegation, like most others, had gone to Seattle with the best of intentions. The Japanese delegation, he tells us, went to Seattle, ready to debate the whole matrix of issues that are intertwined around international trade. The Japanese wanted to discuss not only the specific issues that concerned their American hosts but also the whole institutional and legal framework that continues to hold back international trade. MITI were intent on showing the United States some of the contradictions evident in their stance on a variety of issues. Whereas, for example, the United States objects to Japan and other countries dumping their products at below cost into the American market, Arai and his colleagues had evidence of 64 cases where the United States had dumped its own products into other market, Japan's included. MITI, whatever their faults may be, certainly do their homework.  As well as bringing up America's ambivalent attitude to its own shortcomings, Arai's chapter also raises another issue. That issue is Canada. He speaks of the Quadrilateral Group of Japan, the United States, the European Union and Canada. What is Canada, a very minor economic power doing in that august group and several others such as G7? Why Canada? Why not India for example?  Jayashree Watal, another contributor to this volume, would like to know. His contribution rails against the injustices mighty countries like his own India suffer from the great powers of Japan, the European Union and the United States as well as minnow powers like Canada. He sees the solution in putting development issues more to the center of future WTO debates.  But therein lies the rub. It would be nice if India could have as many outlets of Starbuck's, the Body Shop, McDonald's and Kingburger as mighty countries like Japan and the United States have. However, before such a thing can come to pass, India's per capital income would have to approach the levels pertaining in the United States, Japan and Europe. Because that is not likely to happen in the foreseeable future, trade referees like the WTO, turgid commentators like the Institute for International Economics and unfortunate targets like Starbuck's will continue to flourish. There are some important lessons failures in economics can teach us. Indonesia's ethnic and sectarian strife is a case in point. The WTO, along with the World Bank and the IMF, have a case to answer there. It would be nice if those bodies and the rent-a-mob Starbuck's haters who follow their meetings around addressed themselves to finding fair and equitable solutions to the seemingly intractable problems that eventuate when economic and other forces cause countries like Indonesia to implode. Books like this one that concentrate too much on hitting the right diplomatic keys and on not alienating any of their key sponsors only prolong the problems of global inequity they purport to address.  
 Trying to mix the positive thinking of Robert Schuller, and the faith movement theology of Paul Yonggi Cho and Kenneth Copeland, Osteen has taken the stadium seminar circuit to a new level. Augmented now by his book, "Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential" he pushes the find the god/champion within yourself.  Here, we see he has a study guide to help point out what is not difficult to understand with his book. To his credit, there are a few more Scriptures laced into this guide. However, the main book is not making any points that a study guide will enhance, and only the lowliest of sheep will need the extra help.  People who are down on their luck, or discouraged with life will find Osteen a good read. It is a feel-good book, reducing the image of Christianity to be about us and not about God. Bigger than life is Osteen's picture on the cover, knowing that if you saw him on TV, you might want his book.  "Getting your mind off of yourself," with the goal of self-fulfillment should appeal also to readers of Wayne W. Dyer and other authors looking to reach those who feel disenfranchised.   Osteen's rambling, choppy speaking style comes through, written like he's campaigning for office. Reading like a seminar set to print, it sums as quickly as reading through its self-determinist table of contents:   1. Enlarge your vision  2. Develop a healthy self-image  3. Discover the power of your thoughts and words  4. Let go of the past  5. Find strength through adversity  6. Live to give  7. Choose to be happy   The steps sound innocuous, and, outside of their religious context, are. Within their religious context, evangelicals and charismatics will likely find offense at Osteen's assertions about controlling your own destiny as opposed to letting God control it.   Aim a little higher, and check out Charles Colson's "The Good Life." The title sounds similar, but Colson defines what makes for a good life far differently than Osteen. Save your money, and if you have Osteen's book, read it without the guide.  Anthony Trendl  editor, HungarianBookstore.co 
 Dashiel Hammett, author of such classics as THE MALTESE FALCON and THE THIN MAN, certainly deserves credit as one of the originators of the noir genre. Unfortunately RED HARVEST doesn't live up to this reputation.  	RED HARVEST starts with the Continental Op arriving in the mining town of Personville (sometimes called Poisonville). He has been hired by the editor of the local paper, who turns up dead. This editor is also the son of mining magnate Elihu Willsson, who had called in a collection of hooligans to break a strike. What he had not foreseen was the inevitability the criminals would take over the town.   	Originally I had the idea the "red" in the title had something to do with the socialist workers movement or the Wobblies, a logical assumption since Hammett was a communist, but Hammett settles for the obvious, the red meaning murder after murder as  the Continental Op turns the criminals against each other.  	A blurb on the back of the book lauds Hammett for "sharply and economically defined" characters. They're sharply defined all right, so sharply defined that they all run together. Pete the Finn, Lew Yard, Max Thaler and Noonan, the chief of police, could be the same character. At the beginning of the novel, the Continental Op learns the history of conflict from Bill Quint, an I.W.W. organizer from Chicago, but that's pretty much the last we hear from him.   	About the only interesting character in the whole book is the femme fatale, Dinah Brand, but her sole motivation seems to be money.  	Hammett also has problems with resolution of conflict. When painted into a corner, he simply kills off another character.  	Even the Continental Op is pretty much a cipher. He doesn't seem to have much of a background, other than that he's somewhat afraid of the Old Man, who runs the Continental Detective Agency. We know he smokes and drinks too much and even takes cocaine, but other than that he doesn't live up to his cool name. Unfortunately all of this reads like a bad comic book. Even Hammett would have a good laugh at what the New York Times said about RED HARVEST, I would assume in 1929 when it was published: "RED HARVEST is more than a superb crime novel: it is a classic exploration of corruption and violence in the American grain." I'll give him two stars for noir dialogue, but the rest of it is pretty much dreck. 
 I counted ~15 factual errors (aka lies) during Michael Moore's opening speech.*  I stopped shortly after.  I'm not going to waste my time on such obviously factually-wrong fiction.  How stupid does Mr. Moore think we are?  I was *there* watching the election unfold, and what he reported is NOT what happened.     * Example: He said FOX News pressured NBC, cbs, abc, and cnn to change their minds, and give Florida to Gore, and then Bush.  What a load of lies.  FOX news has no power over the other nets.  NBC, cbs, abc, cnn operate independently, and reached their decisions independently, without influence from Fox.  * And furthermore, the other nets did NOT call for bush (as Moore falsely claimed).  They labeled Florida "undecided", and left it that way for several days.  * Also, Moore claimed that a recount showed Gore won Florida.  FALSE.  A bipartisan committee counted the votes a few months later, and not only did Bush win, but the recount *increased* his lead from a few hundred to several thousand, because of conservative communities in western Florida.  (Many other non-biased groups found the same result.)   This video reminds me of his Columbine documentary, where men's ties kept changing colors in the middle of their speeches (it's called creative editing).   Moore has no ethics.  Propagandist.  As far as I'm concerned, he's no better than a KKK member.   Same mental disorder & illogic.    
 To anyone who has endured corporate life at a sub-executive level, the title of this book will be seen as a dead giveaway to the underlying motives of its authors and those to whom they pander.  The book's message? When one is too greedy a bastard to pay employees a fair wage, simply devise schemes that make them temporarily forget that they are being exploited.  Such short-term distractions allow the "chosen ones" to continue creaming off profits for themselves.  It doesn't take much time to figure out that there is a chasm between executive rewards (e.g., multi-million dollar payouts, regardless of performance) and the scattered bones thrown to an organization's "little people".  [... 
 I consider myself a huge pixar fan. This is easily the most insipid Pixar movie ever. Pixar ran out of pixie dust while making this one. I have read the rave reviews and am scratching my head trying to figure what it was that they like about this movie. Pixar, if you are listening, please, please, dont embarass yourself by dishing out this sort of c-grade stuff. I expect more from you 
 This was very cheaply made.  I was disappointed in it's quality.  Also, it comes apart constantly.  All my daughter has to do is barely touch it and it comes all apart.  I am going to try to glue the pieces in place so she can at least play with it.  We have many Barbie toys and this is by far the worst I have ever purchased.  Not to mention that is was expensive!  I expected much, much better quality from a Barbie product 
 Personally, I am infuriated when an author deliberately writes obtusely to show off how "artsy" he is, or how vast a vocabulary he has.  The author here does that throughout this book.  Here's one example- "the halter of specificity has been imposed on heretofore disorderly concepts."  My other strong objection to this book is how the author takes an active voice asserting his own (incorrect, in my opinion) philosophy.  He does this in numerous ways in numerous places throughout the book.  For example, he indicates Aristotle's philosophy as something that Newton needed to overcome, instead of recognizing Aristotle's role as the originator of the scientific method.  As another example, the author states that Newton's religion, Arianism is "heresy."  He says this despite the fact he admits that Newton kept his religious views to himself.  How did the author determine Newton's religion?  For that matter how did the author determine anything?  The book has no bibliography, much less footnotes.  Finally even Newton's scientific work is undercut by the author's poor views on this subject.  For example, the author sees an arbitrariness in the fact that Newton's laws "favor" a straight line.  The author asks "why a straight line?" and claims Newton had no answer 
 Hideaway bought for my daughter who loves it.  Easily assembled, up within 60 seconds. I have noticed that there are two loops attached to the hideaway, presumably to tie some rope to them and then stake to the ground. There was no rope or stakes with the purchase, I am unaware if these should have been included. Two entrances into the hideaway, the front inverted T entrance is great. However, the rear is a porthole type entrance, not good for children when playing games as they can trip on the material in the bottom. Material not that durable, but with care there should be no issues. a lot bigger than it looks on the site, which was a nice surprise. 
 I received a Diaper Genie as a shower gift, and gave it a chance.  After 8 weeks, we replaced it with a Diaper Champ, which is much better at containing odor.  The problem we had with the Genie is that it is too  hard to use.  You're supposed to put the diaper halfway into a neck thing, then twist twice.  When we did this, about 50% of the time, the twists would come undone, leaving the room exposed to the diaper smell.  Neither my husband or I could determine how to fix this once it happened, and ended up emptying the darn thing at least daily.    The Diaper Champ, however, is one-handed operation, which the Genie is not (you can't open the lid with one hand holding a baby and the 2nd a diaper!).  It contains the smell incredibly well, as long as you follow the directions (fold your diapers into balls, and don't leave smelly stuff exposed to mess up the lid).  We actually keep a small roll of diaper disposal bags for the "blowouts", which we have about once a week, to keep the Champ clean.  It has been a wonderful new baby tool 
 What can I say? It's not a Radio Shack 160" boom antenna. However, this antenna would probably work better if you nail it up on your roof 
 The plot is ridiculous. The characters make absurd decisions that have me screaming at the book and teeming with anger. We are supposed to believe that Hank is a "normal, good" person who commits evil acts out of necessity, but really there are many other more logical, non-criminal steps that could be taken. He continually chooses the immoral path. I totally hate this book and the only reason I gave it two stars is because I am still reading it. Obviously if I hate it, but continue to read it, there is something in it that won't let me put it down. Maybe that was Smith's objective all along. 
 This "book" is probably the worst written I've ever encountered. It was so flawed as to be considered literature. Alice Walker tries to "One-up" Harriet Beecher Stowe, in writing about brutality. Titles like these are weapons used in the Anti-Black Male agenda this society has long perpetuated. All the men depicted in this book are one-dimensional characters with absolutely no redeeming qualities worth noting. The women are portrayed as martyred, forlorn, pseudo-saints who have been set upon by beasts from hell.   The only persons capable of any sort of humanity are exclusively women. I've learned long ago, when absolutes such as these are presented, a greater agenda is at work. There are no "real" men in this book! Only distorted caricatures of Black masculinity. I only found value in this book as a comprehensive example of sexist misandry at its worst. I find this title as dangerous as Hitler's "Mien Kampf", in it's portrayal of Black men as evil and morally destitute.   Presenting such depictions is both dangerous and irresponsible. True, there are criminally abusive men in every culture. But there are also forthright, upstanding  men as well. To present a depiction of such vehement imbalance and disparity, only serves to distort the readers view of the people being written about.   Harriet Beecher Stowe's fictional "Uncle Tom's Cabin", sparked national outrage and eventually a bloody civil war. This title does no less in further distorting the readers perceptions of Black Men.   This book is fiction. However,it is not presented as such. I'm sure the abusive incidents depicted in this book have been based upon actual incidents. I have no qualm about outrage at such abominations. However, I do have a problem when there are absolutely no upstanding male figures who intervene in such aberrations. That is what I find so unbelievable and offensive about this book.   In my opinion, this novel does nothing to laud the strength of women so much as it demeans and distorts the readers/viewers of the people within it. I don't find it a testament to the strength of Black Women at all. I interpret this book as feminist misandry with two purposes...the further distortion of African-American culture and the deliberate depiction and denigration of the Black Male as being hopelessly inhuman.  I'm sure Alice walker made a lot of money with this book. Feminist, racist extremism seems to have found a niche in literature. I wonder if this novel would have had the same accolades, were it a fictional depiction of White American Men brutalizing White Women. Most definitely not!!! I doubt it would have even found a publisher. America is comfortable reinforcing negative depictions of Black Men and African-American culture.  My life as a Black man is difficult enough living as a testament and example against this sort of racial distortion. Whatever Ms. Walker's motivations were in writing this novel, I'm sure mercenary incentives were not discounted.   This is racist, misandrist propaganda masquerading as literature!        
 Turgid, juvenile, witless, inconsistent, pointless, flaccid. Reads like the kind of "You Are There" episode a teenage boy would write, featuring of course sex with the historical figure of ones choice. I got the impression that Aldiss fell asleep at the typewriter several times during the writing of the manuscript, and resumed upon waking with whatever popped into his head, without respect for what had just been written. Bad as the movie was, I conclude that it was an improvement over the book 
 I have bought a few books by Denise Austin and I thought this one would be a greta idea, but I didn't really like it. The first portion of the book before you reach the 21 days is great information, but the meal plans did not seem very appetizing to me. She says that you need to stick to her exact routine for it to work and it just did not fit into my life and it has been sitting on the book shelf ever since 
 Troy why did you put your name on this.  This cd has one good song on it and that is about the long and short of it.  I am not going to waste a bunch of time talking about a cd that is not worthy of being pressed, by the way the group was better with Conrad the Colonel (Ehhhh Hehhh!  I AM DSGB! 
 This book combines exercises of Furey, Tsatsouline, Atlas and others but doesn't add anything. I bought these books previously but struggled to combine them into a system that allowed progression from beginner to advanced. This book's "transformetrics system" claims to do this but misses completely.   The progresson recommended is to add a chapter per week, but as the chapters are dedicated to a body part, its a poor way to progress.  If you are looking for a system, I suggest: - Craig Balantyne's Turbulence Training 6 month bodyweight manual - Alwyn Cosgrove's Program Design Manual + his bodyweight DVD  I give the book 2 stars because the exercises are excellent and its much cheaper than buying the books separately. I recommend it for someone who wants to tryout bodyweight exercies and is already in shape (as there are few beginners exercises) 
 I know H. James is considered one of the "Greats" of American literature and I question my taste for hating most of his writing.  With few exceptions I think he is  a pretentious purveyor of obscurantism.  I read Wings of the Dove many years ago in the days when I would not allow myself to set aside books I did not enjoy.  I recently picked up a collection of his short stories and remembered why I disliked him so much.  Now in my old age I had no pangs of conscience when I happily closed the book before finishing it.  If more of the stories had been like Daisy Miller I would have proceeded further but unfortunately much of the writing reminded me of Wings.  I am currently seeking  relief from Henry's turgid prose by reading Hemingway.  I'd trade in a Henry  for an Ernie any day.  It's also difficult to like Mr. James' snobbish, shallow and unsympathetic characters.  The more sympathetic ones were obscured by his heavy hand and my impatience with his style.        
 I thought this would be a nice way to brush up on my U.S. history, but unfortunately the treatment is quite shallow and much of the dialog deviates from salient historical information. More suitable for grade schoolers or the very casual student. 
 This is one of three Iris Murdoch books I have read, as a good friend of mine is a big fan. I have yet to see why. I found Nuns and Soldiers silly and overwrought, an extended but inexplicable love story filled with  improbable and self conscious conversations. Do people experiencing a coup  de foudre really sit around and dissect their feelings? I don't find the  philosophical or moral underpinnings of the story to be compelling, either.  Social requirements versus individual desire, I guess 
 I purchased my tv in Dec 2004. I did not purchase the extended warranty. These sets are have all kinds of video problems. Myself and other LCD owners have called for in home service. The service company is QUALXSERV in home service. They want $350.00 to come to your home if you do not have the extended warranty, and can not guarantee a fix. Take it from me buy some other Bran 
 This was Alice's big comeback album.  The single "Poison" got him back on top 40 radio for the first time in years, and the album was a huge success.  Cooper was back to playing big arenas in front of sold out crowds.  But......I think the album stinks.  The music is cliche ridden hair metal and most of the lyrics are just plain stupid.  Compared to most of the Coop's other work this dreck just does not hold up 
 Normally I have a lot to say in my reviews, but not this time.  The main problem with this collection is that all the most memorable film scores are just on one disc, with the second used mostly to play out stuff from the last ten years that, really, musically isn't very memorable and only includes three pieces anyone will recognize just because, like the movies they come from, they're based on old TV shows - The Addams Family, Star Trek, and Mission: Impossible.  And that brings up another problem.  With all due respect to the late Jerry Goldsmith, who has provided some truly great classic movie scores, was it REALLY necessary to include TWO versions of the SAME Star Trek march in this collection?  This seems evocative of the milk-it-for-all-its-worth attitude Paramount has had lately toward its now-tarnished crown-jewel franchise.  Where's James Horner's theme music from Star Trek II and III?  If they're gonna put Star Trek on here twice, they should have provided a little diversity.  It wouldn't have taken much, I'm sure.  I'm sure that Paramount's had other films with far more memorable music (even Harold Faltermeyer's Top Gun Anthem could have helped on Disc 2).  This just seems like a lazy attempt at something that really could have been great 
 This is a horrible book.  I liked "Abduction", but Chromosome 6 is a piece of trash in comparrison.  The main problem is the characters.  They are ridiculously unreal.  At one point, there are two female characters who coerce a workmate into visiting an island although they're in the jungle, and they know that guerilla soldiers are all around the island.  It's like they don't care about life.  Not only that, but they talk like a couple of barbies, like for example: It would be totally fun to check out that island.  Good idea, Melaine, why didn't I think of that!    The girl's first attempt at reaching the island is disasterous.  Guards shoot at them then arrest them.  A few hours later when they are released.  One of the fearless girls says something like: That totally pisses me off.  I'm going to get on that island if it's the last thing I do.  The other fearless girl agress, and that same night, they are trying a different route to get to the island!    They want to get onto the island to check on some monkeys they've been experimenting on.    They try again and then get shot at again, but this time they are able to run away without being arrested.  The next day they try again!  Meanwhile, they call their male companion a chicken for not wanting to go with them because he's scared of being killed!  They rationalize every moronic thing they do.  They say something like: They certainly won't expect us to do it again.  So we should do it!  Duh!    When they get to the island, they find the monkeys, but these monkeys are big.  Almost two hundred pounds.  For the next few pages, these three idiots are debating whether they sould approach these monkeys for, "a better look," but they are afraid they might scare them away!  What!  Scare away two hundred pound wild animals?  If I would have been there, I would have been running so fast in the opposite direction that I could have run back on the damn water!    The monkeys obviously almost kill them all!  Didn't see that coming, yeah right!    Anyhow, the book is filled with stupid characters running through a forseable plot.  It stunk.    
 Livia Rokach so loathes Israel that she takes a good diary and twists it into a bad psuedo-history.  For instance, she cites to Prime Minister Sharret's diary entries regarding  the Lavon Affair and concocts, wholecloth, a conspiracy theory involving Ben Gurion, Dayan and Peres. No historian BUT Livia Rokach concurs.  The author goes one step further and blood libels Israel with the most horrendous of accusations, namely, that rogue Israeli Activists, intent on creating a wider war with Jordan, murdered eleven of their fellow Jews at Maaleh Akrabim in 1955 and pinned the blame on Jordan. How low can you go.  Again, no historian anywhere, (See Benny Morris, Israel's Border Wars) finds a shread of real evidence to support the author's wild-eyed slanderous lies.  Sacred Terror is pulp fiction in the guise of history. I'll pass 
 First, it's only fair to say that I found this book interesting in many aspects.  It does add some knowledge and understanding to the field of hypnosis, however, the author is not very effective at illuminating his ideas.  On the one hand, he writes as though his audiance all have PhD's, because he does not do very well at defining his terms, or elaborating on his concepts.  On the other hand, he does not provide any information of the efficacy of the questionaires he provides that an individual with a professional degree would find useful in vetting his theoretical views. He points to Mesmer and Braid as being the the seminal hypnotists, but comepletely skips Milton Erikson who he borrows heavily from, perhaps without being aware of it -- I don't know. This book needs to be rewritten and greatly expanded upon to deserve the title "'Professional' Hypnotism 'Manual'."  In my opinion, it is neither professional, nor a manual. Nevertheless, I probably am underrating this book by giving it two stars 
 I only read 20 pages or so.  The language was so terrible, I gave the book away.  Sorry 
 I'm a long time fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries, and have read all the others. Unfortunately, "Hard Truth" does not live up to the quality of Ms. Barr's earlier works. It feels very contrived. It also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups. This book just does not meet the expectations I've come to expect from the series. 
 I like the recipes, but the organization is lousy.  I like that you get full nutritional information including calories, fat, protein, carb, fiber so you can be in control of what you are eating.  The ingredients are readily available, nothing I had to look up in the dictionary.  I just don't like that it is organized by month.  When I go to cook I'm usually thinking, what can I do with this chicken rather than what tastes good in February 
 I'm a fan of Dave Barry, I enjoy his column, I enjoyed some of his books in the past, and I bought this one with great anticipation. Boy was I disappointed! The story is meaningless, the characters are not interesting, the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny.  Do yourself a favor, do not read this book! I can't believe anyone recommends it 
 I found this book a truly disapointment !! When i started the book , the story of Abby and Lucian was so intense , so passionate that i thought i was going to love it . Then the book advances to this days with the story of Declan and Lena , and it was ugelly disapointing !! They don't have anything in commun with Abby and Lucian !! Lena and Declan , they don't work as a couple in love ; to me they was no chemestry or anything between them . I only read the book till the end because i wanted to know how it was going to end with Abby and Lucian , but that too was a little beyond what i thought it was going to be , they deserv a better ending , i don't now how but that was not what i expected ! 
 Here's the thing -- I wanted to learn the story of Isolde and that is why I picked up this book in the first place.  I have read one other Miles book (I, Elizabeth) and that wasn't very impressive but I thought I'd give Isolde a try.  It was painful!  Miles chronically uses flamboyant and overstated language which just feels silly.  Her characters are very poorly developed.  Also, the author has a strange habit of often not setting up scenes which is resultingly jolting -- leaves the reader thinking, 'Wait!  Where the heck did that come from?'  After reading this book, I couldn't decide if I was more annoyed with the author for writing like this or with her editors for publishing such weak, unskilled writing.  
 I'm an English Teacher and I had my students purchase this pocket book. The past two years of purchasing this book has been a waste of time and money for both parties 
 I have just returned from walking the Camino from Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port to Finisterre, and I used this book as my travelguide. I know that only one star is a tough judgment, but this book has too many inaccurate kilometers, and too many failures about which cities who has/has not alberques (the places where you can overnight as a pilgrim). When you walk the Camino, you certainly need to have a very accurate guide with you, and therefore I can not recommend this out-dated one. 
 After reading the great reviews regarding the VCT870RM tripod (here and elsewhere), I decided to purchase one for my Sony HDR-HC1 camcorder.   When I first opened the box, the VCT870RM seemed sturdy and well made.  The tilting action was smooth and had a nice touch, and the remote controls on the handle worked well.  However, the panning action was so stiff that while attempting to pan, the main column would twist and the handle would bend slightly.  It felt like the tension control knob was tightened, but that was not the case.  In fact, the panning continued to drag severely even with the tension knob completely removed.  I recently found a VCT870RM review from about 5 years ago where somebody else was having the same problem with stiff panning.  However, due to all of the other great reviews for this tripod, I'm assuming that I just received a bad one.  I'm now in the process of working with Amazon to get a replacement sent to me.  So far, Amazon has been great, as they've already scheduled UPS to come to my home and pick up the defective tripod the very next day.  They say that I'll receive my new tripod next week.  I'll post here on the status of the new one when it arrives.  UPDATE:  I received a new replacement VCT870RM tripod from Amazon, and this one works great.  Panning and tilting are both very smooth, and the tension is adjustable.  If I'd have received this tripod originally, I would've given it 5 stars.  The first VCT870RM I received was definitely defective.  I'm glad I returned it, and I'm glad I bought it through Amazon (best price at the time, and a hassle-free return) 
 This is a beautiful book for the coffee table but forget the kitchen unless you have a brigade of chefs. Most of the ingredients are special purchase not something you would have in your pantry. A cup of blood anyone?? And what the hell is "paradise" as in "a few grains of paradise". I can't even find that one in my dictionary of foods and cooking terms. I am an excellent cook with more than 40 years of cooking experience Thomas Kellers "The French Laundry" was workable, albeit complicated. A cup of blood anyone, I think I have 1 left after paying more than $35.00 plus $8.00 shipping for this book. (not from Amazon) Amazon I have learned my lesson I will write 500 times I will not buy books from any source other than Amazon and I will not pay shipping on purchases over $25.00 Thank You!!! However I will keep this book and frame it as a reminder never to purchase thru over priced cook book clubs. Membership now canceled.   
 The written description of this heater led me to believe that it would perform like the 2 5-yr-old Vornado models that are the best electric heaters I've ever had.  The VH2 has major flaws.  It's single fan speed is way too fast, causing heated air to be cool/cold within 10 ft of the heater.  The fan cannot be slowed down.  The thermostat causes the fan to stop and start in ridiculously short intervals; thereby wasting energy I believe.  Finally, the thermostat is set so that when at the highest (hottest) setting it doesn't allow the heater to bring even the immediate area around it to more than 70 degrees F.  I've had the heater <1 mo and will attempt to return it for a full refund in another wk or 2 as soon as I have an alternative brand in my home 
 The cover of mine was decorated with the actress from the movie so I expected it to be the tragic romance with a happy ending on the DVD. Instead I got a description of a couple of college proffessors who cash in their investments to buy a million dollar run down house in Cortona Italy in which they only planned to live in 3 months out of the year.   It doesn't tell a story so much as it describes one, like an outline with too much external detail. It has no dialouge whatsoever so it's very one dimensional. The only thing I got out of it was a strong desire to go buy a lemon tree and see the landscapes of Italy. 
 I'm afraid I'm with most of the other reviewers. jPod is not up to scratch.  The plot's ludicrous (and really rather dull).  The characters are barely two-dimensional. I think the relationship between the main narrator, Ethan, and Kaitlin sums it up [SPOILER]: Early in the book Ethan lets on he's interested in Kaitlin (with no real detail). There are a few exchanges; he says "I like you" and in the next chapter they're boyfriend and girlfriend. A little later they're living together. Just like that. I'm afraid I didn't believe in a single character, so I didn't care what happened to them.  There are too many technical errors to have any tech-cred (I spotted three or four high-school-science-level stuffups and I'm no coder, so I have no idea whether the code bits are legit).  There are a few bits of clever dialogue, which are really the only redeeming features.   And I'd so enjoyed Douglas' blog on the NY Times.. 
 I was very disappointed in this product, as the recordings were the worst I've ever seen. I could have done a better job of recording these for re-sale. With all the Computor knowledge that we have today, it's a shame that a product of this quality would be sold. Amazon, you messed up good this time. 
 I had known about anne perry's homicidal activity before I ever read a book by her.  Maybe that's why this book creeps me out so much. In a debate over nature vs. nurture, ms. perry clearly is on the side of nurture.  She interminably bludgeons one with observations that OTHER people drive you to crime either by driving you crazy or bringing you up poorly.  She may be a social critic but I really don't know if her depictions of morals and manners of her stories' times are even accurate!  Perhaps she understands the criminal mind better than others do but she seems to leave little room for personal responsibility or the power of love.  I wonder why 
 A book on injury prevention is definitely needed in the yoga community. Unfortunately, this book falls short. I think it has potential and a second edition would be great. However, the first 46 pages should be condensed in to about 5-10, fluff in general should be limited, and the diagrams in the asana section should be more informative.  Repetitively on each page in the asana section the author refers to muscle groups and provides a beautifully drawn diagram with too few good, useful labels. This style left me frustrated and confused. In general, it is a gorgeous book, but absolutely tedious at times 
 Although this book had some interesting things to say, it was, in general, too "compact" for its own good. Bruegmann's arguments against traditional anti-sprawl histories read more like a jedi mind trick than a careful argument. A more careful argument with more supporting facts would have added to the book. As it is, it seems to me that this book will do little to change anyone's view of the 21st century city 
 this has got to be the WORST film I've ever seen. its not sad. Its not funny, jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage. I don't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie, because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him. the actor is the worst of all. i cant tell if he's sad in some seens, or angry or jest retarded. I've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks, I guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present. it probably worked better back in 96'. but this movie is SO SO SO BAD. its embarrassing. do not rent it or buy it or view it on television. NOTE'S: THIS FILM HAD  SOME GREAT TALENT A song from Olivia Newton Jon, and (one of my most personal favorites) Mila AND my favorite comedians Margaret Cho. She's to good but...why this film, she (and Mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this.      
 I am a fan of Ms. Lopez's music (particularly the "J.Lo" album), so naturally I bought this DVD expecting to be entertained by it.  Unfortunately, this is by far the most excruciatingly boring concert DVD I've ever seen.  Everytime a song starts to pick up the pace, J. Lo knocks it away to do a dance routine, bringing everything to a screeching halt in the process.  If you want to see a good concert DVD, I recommend you check out Kylie Minogue's "Live in Manchester" concert.  Now there's a performer who knows how to keep things going.  Even during the costume changes there's something interesting to look at.  Perhaps Ms. Lopez should take a few notes from her 
 this one simply is too mediocre not even qualified being good. i've read all iles' complicated yet fasinating novels, most of them carried the weight as any great book should be except some of the endings felt lame and rushed. but this 24 hours didn't hang on in my hands and lock up my eyes' over 24 minutes, i just returned it to the library the next day and would not think about re-reading it again. the other books such as the quiet game, sleep no more, blood memory, dead sleep are all great reading experiences, his first and second ones were just too jewish focused. concentrating on the south is a trade mark of iles, although after hurricane katrina, the nopd police force seemed to be a totally ridiculous lame duck and incapable of doing anything right, not as good as what iles described in his novels. all said, this time no cigar for you, poncho 
 Five stars awarded for sincere effort at persuading evolutionary atheists to consider the claims of Genesis, since the author claims to be a Genesis-Christian (can't be Christian without Genesis). Three stars deducted for challenging the very Genesis that makes this Christian-scientist able to believe a cogent alternative to atheistic evolution. Genesis unrevised in its plaintext vocabulary needs no interpretation or reworking. God did just fine in telling us what He did and how/when. As the Ultimate Communicator as well as Creator, He left us with an unambiguous record of real history as it happened. No scientific revisionism, even by well-intentioned-but-mistaken astronomers, is required. The Lord is forcing the world to a faith-decision, Genesis vs. Evolution: Did God REALLY say...? The WORD said in the Beginning, 'Let it be'. And it was so. The world asks, 'Was it really so?' The WORD answers, 'It is written. So it was.' Any questions? Can people handle God's own truth? 
 This was the second worst star Wars novel I have ever read, the only one worse was the Courtship of Princess Leia 
 Typical storyline that fell short on romance/erotica. Some parts of the story dragged because of unnecessary descriptive writing. The plot was a bit weak, and I only felt some attachment to the characters 
 I don`t like this magazine. It is so boring. The gossip is lame and dry, and it`s basically a mag for tweens to say ¨OMG, ANOTHER HD poster for my room!!¨ There`s hardly any real pages, just regular old posters. Teens, beware- you will be disappointed and totally bored. This is a magazine for girls aged 9-12. Strictly for tweens 
 The voice on the tape is not very engaging, however the story as always is great.  Better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape.  An older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette 
 I ordered before brent birckhead's review came up and I got taken. This is not a leather case for LG enV VX-9900. The correct internal dimension is: 4" x 1 3/4" x 0.5", clearly not a size that the VX9900 can fit into.  Considering that the seller enters the "product dimensions" as 4 ounces instead of the measurments, one might suspect that this may not be an honest mistake.  I think Amazon needs to take better responsibility of ensuring that the sellers fill out the description properly 
 this is a really interesting story at first I have the story was to short a thought I later found that was shaired by manny fans in japan hence Vol. Two I myself thin the story is incompleat I hope that sometime in the furetue that the author would expend on this story. but I would recomend this book to anyone who loves unconvenual love stories 
 This book contains very clear introductions on how SQL server 2000 works, what are the important design considerations for creating a database, and has tutorials on the various tuning tools.  As an introduction on SQL Server workings, it is very good.  However, it is also very light on how to actually monitor and tune a real system.  The tuning checklist is generic and many of the items are only applicable to designers, not someone who administers databases that may have been in existance for years.  If you read the entire book, you can pick out handy items, but it does not give tuning examples, does not tell when to get concerned over particular parameters, nor go into which parameters (from the many supplied by the performance monitor) are really the important ones.  As such, I did not find it much help in my daily activities as a DBA.  I found "SQL Server 2000 for Experienced DBAs" by Brian Knight to be much more helpful 
 I would have ordered this soundtrack except I actually took the time to check out the list of "songs" that were on it and to read a couple of the reviews.  Sure enough, it was exactly as I thought myself....there was only one song that I actually recognized from the movie itself, Gloria Gaynor's "I Will Survive", which is a good song, but not even close to all the other great songs which were in the movie itself, but NOT in the actual "SOUNDTRACK"!  What's up with that???  Great movie, great songs, should have a great soundtrack that is available to the fans, but it does not.  Too bad.  I understand that the person who wrote the actual "musical score" for the movie wants his due, but the fans want "their" music, too.  Do the fans not have a right to what they actually expect on the soundtrack of a movie? 
 Good current trend analysis. Personal political bias reflected. Technical errors: Thinks methane is a fuel - it is not, Thinks is clean - actually causes more pollution to make than gasoline causes when burned.  No conclusions on trends, only vague thoughts and recommends positive thinking 
 This 1009-paged law school casebook is more like an anthology, wherein the collected works overlap with redundant content.  Having read the book twice now, cover-to-cover, it has become clear that the authors are more concerned about proving themselves to the legal community than writing a student-oriented casebook.  Contributing to the repetitiveness seems to be the authors' knack for turning simple concepts into entire chapter sections all the while managing to continue a self-important attitude.  Indeed, the arrogance is displayed throughout.  An often repeated phrase is "one of the authors of this case book..."  Meanwhile, the authors add full law review articles that contribute little to the subject matter.  Fortunately, the authors do give credit where credit is due by citing in bold the authors of those articles-themselves.  All of this and more makes for a poor read.  Suffice to say, the authors on this book know little about the meaning of being concise.  Readers are fortunate that they did manage to cut 361 pages from their prior edition.  One author recently stated that the next edition will be a full 400 pages shorter, which gives one an idea of the present, unnecessary content.  This casebook series is simply in too desperate need of an objective editor to be educational.  I strongly recommend that professors, students, and casual readers alike look to other sources of information, such as the equally-priced University Casebook Series 
 After reading these reviews and seeing that the title was "Real Kitchen" I assumed that this book would be more like Tyler's shows and full of his easy style of just whipping stuff up. However, the book is full of highfalutin recipes and hard-to-find ingredients. I have never cooked with fresh figs and don't plan to any time soon.  I wanted something that is more easy going, like Tyler seems to be. This book is fru-fru and fussy as far as I'm concerned.  If you want a more practical book, look elsewhere. Sorry Tyler! Maybe your next cookbook with suit me better. I will still watch him on TV and perhaps download recipes that I think I will like from the Food Network website instead 
 This is a work of poor scholarship.  The author's account of Egyptian Jewry is politically filtered.  First, he claims that Egyptian Jews were not supportive of Zionism.  Every Zionist movement was representated in Egypt, and active.  He also suppresses evidence that some prominent Egyptian Jewish personalities were Zionists.  For example, he talks at length about Mourad Farag, but does not mention that he was a passionate Zionist.  Farag's work, Al Kudsiyat, goes unmentioned.     MOreover the largest percentage of Egyptian Jews (45%) went to Israel.  The remainder were scattered between the U.S., France, and other countries, so Israel got the lion's share  The author also trivializes the anti-semitism that existed in Egypt long before the Zionist movement.  There were at least 10 cases of blood libels in the second half of the 19th century.  Moreover, even Egyptian Jews who lived in Egypt for generations were denied citizenship.  He only briefly mentions the Company Law that denied Eygptian JEws their livelihood.  Though he mentioned the three massacres of 1948 in which nearly 90 Jews were murdered, he forgets to tell the reader that no serious trial took place.    The author dwells extensively in the Lavon affair, but only because he can blame Israel.  He does not tell the reader that not one Egyptian or foreign soul was killed or hurt during the sabotage operation.  He also refuses to admit that Egypt committed a crime by condemning two of the ring leaders to death.  The author's political bias blinded him and turned him into a poor schola 
 Wolf's religious conversion to the anti-choice cult winning citations from Priests for life among other seedy sources makes her a good candidate for sermonizing at a Promise Keeper rally. Wolf is a charlatan, whose moral  dictates are cheap and limited to mystics. The pulpy format of this  paperback compliments it's content 
 I finished this book only because it was assigned by my book club.  It reminds me of the books I read in sixth and seventh grade, found in the "Young Adult" section of my neighborhood library in the l950's.  Everything about the book, both plot and character development, as well as use of language, is thin, without depth or complexity or passion.  If one likes simple reading, and this is a novel of simple reading, I would recommend Catherine Cookson.  At least, she has great stories told with feeling 
 I began reading Forever Amber last week (hoping to find a book I might like while I waited for another one to come available at the Library) and from the first I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy this book.  But I am one of those readers that feels if a book is started then you should finish it.  Upon finishing it I feel cheated.    The book isn't all that bad.  There is a lot of movement, intrigue and history in it.  But I couldn't feel for the characters.  The main character, Amber, was not someone that I would like and even when things went wrong for her, I still felt that way.  I assume that no one is supposed to like her.  And although I didn't like any of the characters in this book, I guess I did feel something for Amber because I felt like she should be with Lord Carlton...up in until the last part of the book.  Then I realized that she shouldn't be with anyone.    The reason for the two stars is because of the ending.  I hated that ending.  I felt totally cheated after reading the whole 700 plus pages and then the book ending so abruptly.  I agree with others who have left reviews here, it seems that the author decided that she either didn't want to write anymore of this book or she ran out of things to write about.    Anyway, it was an okay book to keep me occupied until the book I have been waiting for becomes available but I would never recommend this book to anyone. It's really not worth the time.   I guess you either love the book or you hate it.  And I hated it. 
  "She's either the love of his life or the end of it" reads the tagline for "Fascination". And that right there is a big tip-off for what kind of movie to expect. It gives the entire movie away.   Patrick Doherty died in a swimming accident but the odd thing is he was an excellent swimmer, soon, 3 months to be exact his wife, Maureen (Jacqueline Bisset) is engaged to Oliver (Stuwart Wilson) to the dismay of her son Scott (Adam Garcia).   Scott soon meets his step-sister Kelly (Alice Evan) and believe it or not an attraction starts. Soon Kelly, in subtle ways, starts to manipulate Scott's mind and starts making him think his mother killed his father.   "Fascination" really wants to be a steamy sexy thriller. I can see it either as a cinemax late night movie or a WB TV series. The movie even goes as far as to have the guys walk around with open shirts to try and make us, or at least the women, think the movie is sexy. You could compare this movie to the works of Claude Chabrol, the dirty secrets of an upper-class family has always been one of Chabrol's favorite themes. But "Fascination" does not have the pleasure of being directed by Chabrol instead it is directed by Klaus Menzel. Menzel though makes the mistake of taking away all of the mystery of the film. He tries too hard to spell everything out of us. Events become too obvious and thus breaks all the suspense the movie could have created. That is a sign of Menzel's inexperience.   I mentioned that Scott and Kelly have an attraction between them knowing full well they are about to become related. "Fascination" is now starting to open a whole new can of worms for itself as now it's dealing with incest. The reason I question this move is because the movie just doesn't seem interested in exploring these people and instead wants to focus on the mystery of whether Scott's father was murdered. To bring incest in the story means that you are going to have to examine the relationship between these people. "Fascination" does not dwell on the psychological aspect of these people.   Then we have the terrible dialogue. It simply sounds phony. The scene where Scott meets Kelly is an embarrassment for the actors. The pick-up line he uses on her is corny. People don't really talk to each other this way. The movie has problem with that. Dialogue is not written in a convincing way. Even the music is wrong. It tries too hard to be alluring and sexy, like the movie itself. Menzel is hitting us over the head making sure no one walks out of this movie confused. While that is a very nice gesture on his part it really does take out all the suspense of the situation.   "Fascination" has a twist up its sleeve that is just sprung on us. I think it's a cheap shot, you may not. Nothing leading up to this secret though is really suggested.   Is "Fascination" a really bad movie? Not really. One is almost tempted to merely toss it aside as a "guilty pleasure". A movie that doesn't seem to have high ambitious but is entertaining nonetheless. Notice though I said one is "almost" tempted. That doesn't mean that I'm going to do that.    Bottom-line: Despite the pleasure of seeing Jacqueline Bisset the movie doesn't have much to offer. Director Klaus Menzel tries too hard to spell everything out for us but the movie then comes cliche and predictable. The movie carries no suspense 
 This was the first Ludlum book I have read.  I bought several and now am thinking I've wasted my money.  He took a realistic story and destroyed it with an unbelievable plot.  All the bad guys, who have so much power that they can have anyone in the world killed within 24 hours of the victim hearing about the Secret Plot to control the World cannot even protect their top masterminds from being kidnapped by a New York lawyer, his consultant ex-wife, and a couple of low-level military officers.  Then, each bad guy willingly spills everything about the Secret Plot merely upon learning that one of his colleagues has insulted him?  Give me a break.  Don't even get me started on how unrealistic the relationship is b/w the main character and his ex-wife.  Give the book as a gift to your 12 year old nieces and nephews, but don't waste your time or money on this if you are over 12 years old 
 My 10-mo-old son showed no particular interest in this "table". I did not like it much either. Why would a 10-mo-old show any interest in table items that sing? I have left it without legs. Two minutes after I installed the legs my son nearly fell with the "table" on his face. Had to uninstall them. Not good for active infants. Also not very entertaining. Buy the one from Leapfrog but still be careful when you have installed the legs because they say that that one is higher than this (might have more balance though but I do not know for sure) 
 Somewhat disappointing as I was looking for a deeper explanation of the fundamental relations, as the book's name implies. Aikido and Tai Chi Chuan are both internal martial arts and I would have thought that the philosophies, techniques & applications would have been described in more detail than maybe the two sentences mentioned in the entire book. A great deal is discussed about the history of the Chinese Martial Arts and its influences into the Japanese martial arts, which is fine and perhaps from which the fundamental relations are drawn from. In this case, the book should have been titled - ..."The Historical Relations." Keep looking elsewhere if you are searching the true fundamental relations. 
 In another rehashed treatise on Savage's perverted sense of truth, he sells a miserable, peripatetic screed to his lemming-like followers.  This man's politics and principles have been condemned by such well-established conservative journals as The Economist.  We all need someone to trust, and for Savage that person is the MD who will prescribe him some thorazine.  Gets 2 stars only because of the book's educational value as an example of the ramblings of a lunatic.  Barry Goldwater must be spinning in his grave 
 Aidoo gives new meaning to the term "female whiner". Her brief "novel"(about 132 pages) is a trying exercise in whining about being a woman, and being an African. She may have cause to whine, but please spare us the long poems that break up the text. If I wanted to read poetry, I'd buy a poetry book. I hate it when authors insert poems in midstream. It breaks up the text, and detracts from the action. Anyway, Sissie is a Ghanaian who visits Germany, makes cute with a German woman, and reflects on how bad colonization and Africans can be. Not recommended except for insommiacs

 No wonder John Gardner didn't write more fiction books.  He was far too preoccupied with what he believes makes good fiction, rather than actually writing it.  "Creative atrophy" I believe John Gardner himself would call it.  If there's ever been a better example of the "those who can't do, teach" argument, I haven't encountered it.  This is hardly the place a "Young Writer" should start.  Instead, how about reading what you like and avoiding "ignoramouses" such as John Gardner?  John Gardner is unable to accept the fact that many of the world's finest writers never made it through college, and many more didn't have the luxury of a "rigorous classical education."   The most hilarious part is where Gardner mentions that only through a line-by-line university level discussion will anybody ever be able to fully enjoy Shakespeare.  It's interesting to note how Gardner, who "taught" creative writing at the university level, fails to exhibit the critical thinking and objectivity he says one can only obtain through a college education 
 If I lived in Vermont, and NY, and wrote everyday, and if I cared more about the sweat wicking abilities of my clothes, this would have been a good book.  I live in So Cal, and have vowed to not shop for months at a time successfully.  I thought this book might buttress my ability to do so.  But, I have a viceral annoyance with someone that is okay with asking their neighbors to help them out with their choice of not being responsible for their lack of responsibility.    If I drive on bald tires, I need to have an AAA membership.  If I have a "home" without the basic necessities, I need to make sure I can get through normal climatic changes (um, like, snowstorms in Vermont and NY)without ragging on my "friends" for not being there for me.  I did read the entire book, but only to see if in the end the author told me she should have planned on being more self-sufficient.  She did not 
 As a yoga video junkie, I have tried out a lot of different routines and instructors...and the best I've come across so far is Yoga for Surfers Fluid Power Yoga -- you don't even have to be a surfer to benefit from it! It's really beautiful, and Peggy Hall strikes just the right balance between the physical and spiritual sides of yoga. There are easy modifications to follow, and she's really inspiring and encouraging. She also ends with a very peceful relaxation sequence -- great images for visualizaion without getting sappy. There's a real sense of beginning, middle, and end, a full, complete practice. I also have Yoga for Surfers I, and I'll buy whatever else Peggy Hall creates 
 Ok, I don't mean to be rude, but if you think this is great writing you are woefully uneducated. It is almost a sad confirmation of the common stereotype of fundamentalist Christians being uneducated yokels that so many of them think this is great writing. Here's my take: I'd enjoy a good "end of times" story - this just isn't it. The Left Behind series is amateurish and poorly written and just plain astonishing to me that it has had such huge success. P.T. Barnum once said that no one ever went broke understimating the intelligence of the American public and this series proves it. Christians should demand better writing from their revered authors. Go read some C.S. Lewis or something - please. 
 "The Cherry Orchard" is an atrocious play.  If we hold this play in high regard, then we dramatist's need to reevaluate our standards.  Chekhov wrote a play that will make you not care an inch about the character's or their situation(s).  For him to think that this is a comedy makes you wonder if he understood the point he himself was trying to make.  The characters are pathetic and they'll make you pity them - not because of their predicaments, but because of whom they are.  I do not recommend 
 Actually, I listened to an unabridged audio book, and I thought it was the most painfully slow book I have ever read in my life. It was fairly well-written, but I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen. Finally, it did, and the book was still crawling along. I really wasted my money on this one, and the only reason it got two stars rather than one is that it was well-written - but it surely could have used some pacing and plot 
 It seemed like there were 2 articles & 80 pages of advertisements 
 size 9.5 fit like it was an 8. I wear a 9 typically and could barely get my foot in, and was unable to walk in them at all without pain. I've bought Steve Madden before many times and know they run slightly small, but this pair was ridiculously small and I suspect perhaps mis-labeled 
 Sontag represents a certain type of "intellectual" who is - thankfully - becoming increasingly rare in the world of google and broadband. As exemplified by Descartes (I think, therefore I am), this is the school of people who think that truth can be discovered solely through rumination - without doing any research, without experimentation, without any investigation of the world outside of your skull. It is pure subjectivity - gloriously self-referential and egotistic, completely self-contained and titannically self-satisfied. What Sontag's writings are about are Sontag - not the world as it is (and which can easily be fact checked) but the world as seen through the coke bottle lens of Sontag's ego and self. Sontag would hate the comparison but she is the leftist equivalent of the medieval christian mystic - the world outside of her own mind doesn't matter and facts have no weight. This is what enabled her - in one of the most egregious public acts of heartlessness in the last one hundred years - to praise the 9/11 terrorists for bravery while the World Trade Center was still smoldering and bodies were still being dragged from the debris. This was like praising the Nazi concentration camp managers for efficiency and thoroughness. Having distanced herself from humanity and decency with her warped and unbalanced intellect, the stunned response to her statements probably bewildered her completely. No matter as her crazed statements had plenty of precedents in her previous writings. She took the very cheap, easy, and elitist high road of condemning every wrong in the world - without ever offering any solutions and always, always, condemning the USA for actually trying to do something about these problems rather than just word process away safely in her study surrounded by the works of Verlaine, Rimbaud, and Genet.  In Photography, Sontag is at the Acme of her (witch) craft. She thinks (and enough critics seemed to have agreed with her) that a well written sentence implies veracity as if the good sentence was a litmus test for truth; as if grammar and a good thesaurus conferred reliability, sanity, or common sense. It doesn't. She'll be forgotten. I think she would have appreciated that - joining the obscure writers that few people read, enjoyed, or valued. She was too elitist to have enjoyed it very much if she actually was embraced by the masses 
 I suppose this is a good book for someone who is just learning how to play poker.  I didn't have much faith in the book when I purchased it.  It's cheaper than alot of poker books, so I figured Hellmuth would at least share a couple of good nuggets of information.  If you have never played poker and want to learn the rules of the game, and starting hand strengths, you will benefit from this book.  If you're a thinking player looking for insights from others, look somewhere else 
   This book by the cover appears to be a very in-depth book when in fact it is meant to be a sort of text book. I have taught for over 4 years and this company was a primary source of text books. Over all their text books are of good quality, but leave a bit more to be desired. I found this book to be in-line with my history with this publisher. In fact if I had known that the book was by them I would not have purchased it for myself. That was my mistake for not paying closer attention.    The book offers the typical level of information that I would expect from this publisher. It will provide enough information to dazzle those of you that are not so technically inclined, and may even impress you. For those that have a bit of technical knowledge. You will find the book basic and leaving you at a point where you will either want to know more, or are not sure if this book offered you any more information than you already knew.    Anyone that is serious about finding out information about the Tivo box, the actual software, or remote hacking is pretty basic and offers no real interesting information that will really improve your Tivo experience. It offers information about changing the text and displaying information on the screen that really has no realavence, or benefit.   As for the hardware hacking, this information may be interesting to someone that may be timid about opening the box. If you have any real computer experience, you could have figured most of this information on your own.   In my best oppinion I would pass on this book. In fact if any other Tivo books are of similar quality I would save the money and find a good library to check it out for free. Even if it is late you will have still spent less than the shipping 
 This is junk. Since the end of the Soviet Union, it appears that "swarthy" Arabs are the new evil which the - guess what? - handsome, dedicated, sensitive-because-his-true love-died, intelligent, military-minded white guy has to single-handedly defeat and, of course, save Western Civilization from the narrow, evil-yes, "evil" again-tentacles of Islamic terrorism. And, as is the case these days in this whole genre of trashy spy novels, "Islamic" MEANS "terrorist."  And our Golden Boy does what we expect him to. This is so trashy and predictable, I feel Ludlum ought to pay us all back. Don't waste your time. 
 I thought it would be really cool to be part of a society that wore red hats in public.  Being part of a club where one could identify another club member because they are wearing a certain item of clothes while in public, fascinates me.  But then I started reading the book.  I found the characters non-believable.  The rules of the club, do overs and make overs were just too restrictive.  Life is not about squashing dialogue with your friends because you are too uncomfortable or too polite to say what is on your mind.  The scene about catching Harold in the act truly stretched my imagination.  The amounts of money thrown around boggled my mind.  And the ending?  It reminded me of the last episode of Seventh Heaven 
 Honestly, I thought the book was just plain boring and repetitive.  The author's main point, although interesting, seems to me like it would fit into an essay.  Also, the particular print of the book that I purchased, has a dog on the cover, I was very much expecting the book to center around dog behavior.  Instead, I felt I little duped. Most insight into dog behavior came from previous third person experiments/theories or anedoctal accounts of "My Friend's dog Fido, one day did this..."  I hardly think that what one dog did can be generalized to the whole dog population.  I mean, the author doesn't even have a dog!!  I suspect that I, who have had a lifelong history with dogs, have more first hand experience with dog behavior than the author.   I don't recommend this book to all the dog lovers out there.  Now, if your "thing" is cows....  Get this book!   
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be. They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body. Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first. A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects. Some don't make it out the other side. I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone. Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones. I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too. Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 Reading this book was like driving the interstate from point A to point B, exiting every ramp, driving around the countryside and then on-ramping again only to wonder when the end-point is reached why the journey was begun at all. I admit, I'm not a fan of half-page sentences, and there were far too many for me in this slow-moving, tedious misadventure. I admit to feeling some sympathy for Jackson Brodie, a sad plodding investigator who even his ex-wife beats up, but had little feeling for the other characters. Ms. Atkinson writes well and can turn a phrase, but for me, most of the phrases weren't worth turning. This book read much longer than its length and only sheer determination caused me to finish it. If you're looking for a well-written work of literary fiction where the journey means more than the plot, this may be a book you'd like. But if you're looking for a gripping mystery taut with suspense, keep looking. Maybe it was personal preference, but CASE HISTORIES just wasn't my cup of tea 
 This book is a collection of stories about parents potty training their children. I couldn't quite get a plan of action or specific answers out of it. Kind of like reading a novel when you want an instruction book. 
 I adore his series with Precious in No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency and purchased The Sunday Philosophy Club in high hopes.  I could not finish it.  I forced my way through half the book hoping it would get better - it didn't.  I finally realized after a month went by and I did not pick it up that I was just not going to finish it.  So I traded it in at a local used book store.  I just never grew to care about the main character and the plot did not progress.  The main character was just a monstrously bored busybody.  I did not see any justification for her actions throughout the book.  And the endless talks of ethical and philosophical dilemmas were grueling - I skimmed through them.    I have been telling everyone not to bother with this book.  It was very disappointing 
 I read this book because: of my love for old school jazz and the big "HOOPLA" over this publication! I can't say that I gained much knowledge from this book. If you are a true collector of jazz and know Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Lee Morgan, Charlie Parker, Dizzy, Wes Montgomery, Freddie Hubbard, Billie Holiday, Coltrane and others then you already know more or as much as what is written here.You've got 512 pages to tell a story about a subject so diverse and complex that I don't know how he did it and felt that justice was done! What I would have preferred he did was to write several books on jazz EACH concentrating on a particular era. That way I think the public would get a true and comprehensive study of our most beautiful and natural resource--jazz. Sorry but I can't offer a rating higher than 2 - 2 1/2 stars 
 I would consider this book to be of subpar quality.  It was decently written but the book mainly consisted of exerpts from other books and then a few comments on the authors opinions of those exerpts.  Usually I will finish a book of this size in one sitting and about a month later I'm still trying to get through this one.  I would only reccomend it if you're extremely bored 
 POOR QUALITY AND FLARED LIKE A MATERNITY TOP.IF YOU ORDER FROM LANDS END THRU AMAZON AND THE ITEM GOES ON PRICE BREAK,SEVERAL OF THE ITEMS I HAVE ORDERED HAVE GONE ON A PRICE BREAK.LANDS END WILL NOT AJUST THE PRICE ,YOU WILL NEED TO SEND THE ITEM BACK PAY FOR MORE SHIPPING AND THEY WILL RE SHIP,THEY DON'T CHARGE FOR SHPPING AND THEY ACT LIKE THEY ARE DOING YOU A FAVOR,THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL EVEN TELL YOU THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE ORDERED FROM THE DIRECT.THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL DO LITTLE FOR YOU SINCE YOU ORDERED IT FROM AMAZON AND THEY WILL TELL YOU UNTIL THEY AND YOU ARE BLUE IN THE FACE,THAT THEY CAN NOT HELP YOU BECAUSE IT WAS ORDERED FROM AMAZON.GOOD LUCK 
 Johnny Tremain is the absolute worst book I have ever read in my entire life, hands down. No book has filled me with such a sense of dread as I opened it like Johnny Tremain has. The way this book is written is as follows; *30 Pages of Filler *One page of plot For the entire book. That's really it. This haphazardly thown together clump of ink and pulped wood is like a swirling vortex of bad writing and mediocrity. I would not wish this book on anybody. not even my worst foes. I promise you if Amazon had a way to input stars lower then one, that vote would be mine for this book. Teachers; Don't let this be used in class. Everybody else; Spare yourself the misery and torment you would otherwise bring upon yourself by so much as reading the first paragraph 
 Welcome to the incredibly boring world of the Mississippi Valley.  If you have to read this book, the last paragraph of each chapter will sum everything up for you.  There is also a ten page summary at the end of the  book!  So if this is required reading, don't sweat it.  You can get  everything you need out of this book in ten minutes!  Please don't waste  your time reading the entire book 
 I was hugely disappointed with this book. While some of the new 3.5 rules features are nice, those familiar with its 2nd edition predecessor, the Monstrous Manual, will find the more aesthetic aspects of this book lacking.  Firstly, the quality of the illustrations in this book doesn't even come close to that of the 2e Monstrous Manual (the same could be said for most of WOTC's illustrations). Some creatures don't even get an illustration.  Secondly, the book is poorly laid-out. This has already been discussed, and WOTC rectified it in subsequent MM publications -- but they should seriously consider re-revising this book.  Thirdly, the editing is almost nonexistent. Barely a page goes by without some sort of typographical error (ie. cleric spelled 'clertic' or 'x monster is about is about y feet high'). Hell, the sub-editors didn't even notice that their entry in the credits is written as "Editorial Assitance". There is a proofreader named in the credits, but it's painfully obvious she didn't actually do any proofreading before the book went to print.  In conclusion, while the 2e Monstrous Manual might be obselete in terms of rules, it was a much better product. It had more monsters, better illustrations, a better layout, and better editing. It was better value for money than this rubbish. Sadly, though, if you want to run a game using the d&d 3.5 rules, you're going to need to get a copy of this book. See if you can get one second-hand, though, as it's really not worth the price new 
 The "Painless Plucker" isn't painless and it isn't very good at "plucking" either.  It looks fairly sophisticated... but it isn't.  Too good to be true?  Yes...  If you're looking for a decent tweezer, the best I've found have diamond-coated tips... I strongly encourage you to find one of these instead 
 Well, I read through about 60 five and four star reviews before I gave up on trying to find somebody who was willing to tackle the problematic ending of this novel. Let me start off by saying that I was loving this book all the way through Part 5. The cliffhangers were great, I loved the authentic Southern voice King breathed into each of the characters. He had crafted something so good. And then he didn't treat it with the care it deserved. Part 6 was weak, seeming inconsistent with the characters and the tone of the book.  The problem is you have characters that have displayed heroism in every other circumstance suddenly choose cowardice. Paul, Brutal, Harry, Dean and even good John Coffey all decide there is nothing left to do but go through with the motions. Is it their failure in this decision that leads to Paul's unhappiness, his "damnation" as he states?  This book starts with a message of tremendous hope. There are miracles. God works through the most unlikely of instruments. But the book concludes with near despair, that God permits all the bad things to happen and responds that "He doesn't care." What a careless way to conclude-completely sapping out of us the hope that the rest of the book has enfused us with! It is affronting to a spritual mind. Obviously God does care, pouring out grace and miracles so often that we've labeled them commonplace, and commissioning messengers that mankind kills. Paul Edgecomb is such a great heroic character throughout the book, King treats him so poorly in the denoument. It pains me to say it, because I feel like I am chastising a wise old friend. Yet he need not look to the heavens for the cause of so much suffering, but deep inside for his own shortcomings in saving an innocent life 
 This book is for specialists, mapping Earth. Myself I found it not interesting 
 I'm a huge shadow fan and I was hugely disappointed to find that this album is basically one long mixtape of obscure and, in my opinion, terrible west coast hip hop.  I didn't think it was the real DJ Shadow until I heard an ad for The Privat Press at the very end of the CD.  It could be that I'm an old school NY hip hop head and this just wasn't my style.  It could be that the music on this CD is simply weak hip hop.  All I know is I wish I could return it.  Contact me if you want to buy it cheap 
 I picked up this book expecting a fresh approach and analysis of Dr. King apart from the obligatory images we're force-fed each new year.  Instead, I was disappointed to find that Eric Dyson made heavy use of speculation with the intent to scandalize more than to inform and enlighten.  One such example includes Dyson conveying the idea that Dr. King may have engaged in orgies with many different women along with his right-hand man Ralph Abernathy.  He then goes on to infer that there was talk of King and Abernathy engaging in sexual acts with each other!  The author had no commentary to either support or dispel this "theory" making Dyson's retelling of the alleged incident totally irresponsible and even libelous.  He just dropped the information, true or untrue, in the readers lap to do with as the reader pleased.  To that end, it is my opinion that Dyson's intent in writing this book was in no way honorable or truth-seeking, rather it was a means to convey his baseless ideas to anyone who would listen.  I'm reminded of something my grandmother and mother would always say to me, "an empty wagon makes the loudest noise." Eric Dyson makes a lot of noise in this book but totally lacks substance.  This was an expensive tabloid 
 Having left my studies of analytical philosophy many years ago - a fervent Wittgensteinian and ardent admirer of J.L. Austin - I had been looking for a way to learn what has happened since I left. It's the kind information that doesn't get into the newspapers and magazines. Soames' book fills the bill nicely, tracing the large patterns of development and at the same time working through key arguments and controversies in some decent detail. It's no replacement for a series of courses and careful reading of original texts, of course, but neither is it glib or patchy. It serves an important purpose to provide perspective on a subject that has developed to a great degree within academic journals. I haven't yet discussed it with Eccles, Bluebottle or Major Bloodnok. 
 He manages to do nothing but try to reinforce the same sterotypes about the sexes of Gray and Gurian.The same tired  myths "men look for beauty" and women "power,money and strength" are a theme of the book.I have read many books about  gender and they smack of agenda and recycling of sterotypes. Don't waste your money.Better yet don't waste your mind on this nonsense.The right wing has an agenda to keep the status quo, to undermine women and keep all men in the shackles of power even if they don't want it in many individual cases.He doesn't want women to have any aggression,power or status and uses  myths to help his sorry cause 
 Sorry, but I found this book a total waste of time. I never did like the main character - I found HER boring! I laughed out loud when I read another reviewer say that "this person escaped her life to be a secretary?" - good point! It was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this "new" life without really taking time to search her soul. Instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I couldn't have cared less what happened to her anyway! After reading it (book on tape) I felt I had totally wasted my time. What a disappointment 
 This is the worst book in the history of books!!!!! My friend said it was good and i won't tell you that his name is cory shneck. Or SMS student. But it is the worst and most boring book in the world! Never read this book even if your being tortured 
 sound the same, these guys call themselves producers?? Mas Flow and Mas Flow 2 were okay, the first Flow was 3-4 stars easy, but soon after listening to their beats you find out they all sound the same from other productions. ALSO doesn't help that every 90% of the reggaeton artist use Luny Tunes for their beatz. LOS BENJAMINS was just a weak album, not one good song/hit came out of it. We need to old producers como dj nelson, dj frank, playero, etc..e.tc.. 
 Finally a book with the courage to stand up and tell people with their heads stuck in the 1950 that theyre abslutely right about everything! Glory to the author who finally proves that women in fact should not be paid equal to men who do the same work, and in truth should not be working at all, because totally a whole bunch of science shows how women with professional ambitions and successes in the private sector are just plain stupid and doting housewives whose lives consist entirely of ovens and vacuums are totally where its at! After all it is a true fact that most women who are in a relationship with a domineering husband with religious convictions and a family who puts pressure on them to behave like their idealized mental image of women and who have learned a long time ago that its just better for them not to resist any longer and to do what theyre told report in surveys run by organizations with a political, to say nothing of sociological axe to grind are PERFECTLY HAPPY with their lives, so that proves everything! And furthermore this book was written by a woman! And even though that means she is violating the basic premise of the book by having professional ambitions of her own as far as being a writer (lets not forget, every day spent writing this book is a day you could've spent cranking out more babies like youre supposed to, woman) its still 100% true! No wait, its 200% true because it contradicts itself! Hooray for the 1950s regressive conservitive oppresively religious and slightly sexist mindset! No, actually I dont know what sarcasm is. Why 
 Despite what others would have me believe, I do not remember chuckling, much less laughing, at any moment while reading this book.  I just kept patiently waiting for a story, or even a point, to surface, but after finishing the Epilogue I didn't find either 
 The most unfortunate thing about this book is that you should have read Pratchett's other novels to catch some jokes about Rincewind, the wizards and other characters. My intention was to introduce a friend to Terry Pratchett's hilarious writing and was not able to use this book for that reason. I would probably have to use some other book, may be "Moving Pictures".   Apart from that, this book is only moderately funny and Pratchett resorts to some cheap puns here and there, which I found disappointing. This is a novel that seems like Pratchett wrote at the insistence of the publishers, but did not really have the energy to. 
 Everything is fine, everything is OK. The simplest answer is the most likely.  Conspiracies are made up by left-wing wackos with nothing to do.  Did Iran-Contra ("Ask about the cocaine!"), Tuskegee, MK-ULTRA, Latin American germ warfare, Bay of Pigs, Allende overthrow, CIA LSD research of the 50s, '66 NY subway experiment, and the Arbenz coup in Guatemala all happen?  No they didn't.  Oliver North acted alone and was deranged and crazy.  E. Howard Hunt was a deranged loner who tried to kill Castro.  Uncle Sam was a crazy deranged lunatic that give African Americans syphilis in 1932.  He acted alone.  God bless America.  I love our leader.  The more than fifty people that died after the Kennedy assassination all committed suicide.  They were distressed by Oswald's murder of Kennedy and could not go on living.  Shame on you Mr. Oswald.  I love you Mr. Posner.  You're a lot better than that Oswald guy.  Mr. Posner: would you please write a book debunking the claims of The Chuch of the Sub-Genius?  JR Bob Dobbs is a nut and must be stopped.  God bless you and your people 
 This book is a bigotry masqueraded behind the veil of a "scholarly work." Every rule of rigorous work has been violated in this piece of work building on the darkest but forever smallest side of "soccer." Wasting this great opportunity to reveal the multi-dimensional power of the game the author invests his bitterness against the sport page-after-page. A sweet revenge for "soccer" rejecting him in his early age? Well... my advise to the author... keep on running away from the ball sir... and please stay away from it!!! You are RUINING THE GAME!! 
 Most of the recipes had long lists of ingredients.  The recipes didn't sounded enticing.  I love cookbooks but I returned this one 
 Mr. Cooper shows his old age in writing these "memoirs." Repetitious and annoying statements by the author makes you skip around the book for more lucid commentary, but to no avail. There have got to be better books out there about the Sherman tank in WWII battles. Get this book from a library or garage sale. 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 As another reviewer states the original had 150 color plates this version has only 8 in mine. The visual phenomena are so complex that without the plates you can't possibly accurately understand what the book is talking about. Sure you could make you own examples, but if you did, you would NOT be sure, given the complex examples, that you understood what the author was talking about. Instead you will have a false understanding or incomplete understanding that will make you look foolish. The publisher is cashing in on the author's previous great work without really republishing it. This is the lowest I've ever rated a book 
 One of the blurbs I read on the book jacket compared this book to Into Thin Air and The Perfect Storm. No way!. Those two books were edge-of-your-seat reading experiences. This account of a kayaking expedition is just plain boring. The action doesn't start until about halfway or more into the book and even then, the cliched writing and deification of Balf's subjects make this book very hard to get through. Unless you are a serious kayaking fan, I would not recommend this book 
 A big disappointment from a distinguished institute like the Culinary Institute of America.  A little book with even less info.  Headings with a paragraph or two will not help menager or even servers keep customers coming. This book needs a more explanations and examples - give incites to experiences 
 There are not many books that I read that I find boring, but unfortunately this was one of them.  I was especially dissapointed after all the glowing reviews saying how funny this book was supposed to be. I found it very repetitive and dull. I also agree with other reviewers who wonder what the whole side-story about the tractor book was for. Those readings from the father's history book were especially boring.  It also took me more than a week to finally finish this since I just couldn't get into it. It was just silly episodes about the eccentric father and greedy, but supposedly, stunningly-beautiful Valentina over and over.  The author tried to delve a little into the history of why the sister was the way she was and about the horrors of war but then left us with no clear ideas about what she thought about these topics. We also never quite know whether Valentina is a good or bad person. Luckily I didn't pay much for this because I bought it second-hand from Ebay.  I wish I'd gotton it out of the library instead. Not worth the time it takes to read since there are much better books out there.  I learned nothing from this book and can't even say I entertained by it either.   
 it sucks it breaks easy and doesn't work good   dont waste your money like i di 
 If this is the book of the film, god knows how bad the film is. I worship B5 but being in Britain we have not seen the TV version. This was a terrible hactchet job of hashed together bad ideas that lead nowhere.  Thirdspace was very good, but this is awful 
 I liked this book all the way through the trial, but the post-trial revelation was, at the very least, ridiculous.  It did not come across as a "Sixth Sense" shocker but a cheap shot out of left field.  It was stupid and didn't fit with the story, at all.  The author didn't need it and should have tied up the loose ends a different way.  I can't even look back on the book and see how it all it.  It didn't.  Throughout the book, even alone with his own thoughts, Tom didn't reveal his true character.   This book was a huge disappointment!  I would not recommend that anyone waste their time.  In the end, when all is "revealed" nothing makes sense.  No matter how hard you might try - it doesn't fit, at all!  
 This is, without question, the WORST book ever written on one's financial life.  To begin with, it's useless: ZERO information, ZERO new analysis of old information, ZERO advice, ZERO interesting anecdotes.  Additionally, it's rambling--meandering from summaries of old data, to poorly written schmaltzy 'new age' feel-good blathering.  What exactly is this guy's point?   No way to tell.  Seriously, this book is SO BAD that all the people who allowed their names to be associated with blurbs on the cover have, in my opinion, lost all remaining credibility.   What a waste of my $16 and 4 hours.  I want my money and time back. 
 I liked this when it arrived.  However after a few uses the pestle broke in two.  The pestle is hollow and apparently quite fragile, making it of little use 
 I had to read this book for a Technology and Education class, and it was a total waste of time and money. I'm a professional computer consultant in the middle of a Masters in Education, so I feel qualified to discuss the technical aspects of this book.  While this book was Copyrighted in 2005, almost all the pictures and content are so dated I think that little has changed since the first edition. A Third edition has just been released, which may be more up to date, but I feel it will be just as useless.  The main problem with this book is that it covers everything with no regard to technical ability. For instance, the book informs the reader what a scanner is, and then says they can be usefull for converting a printed page to editable text on the computer. If you are learning what a scanner is for the firs time today, then you AREN'T ready to start using OCR to import documents. In other places, it says floppy disks (yes, the 3.5 disks) are useful for storing information (most computers don't even accept floppy disks).  Additionally, the book is entirely pro-microsoft. It briefly touches upon 'free' software as it distinguishes between shareware and freeware, but doesn't mention Free/Libre Open Source Software. Between Sakai, Open Office, Firefox, and the myriad of other programs, this is inconceivable. All the pictures are for Word, Outlook, and Internet Explorer. It also makes no mention of Apple Computers (at least I didn't find any) or GNU Linux/*BSD.  Finally, it is filled with cute buzzwords that mean nothing, at least to me, such as "The DID's formative feedback look ensures performance objective validity." which appeared on the sidebar with a lightbulb.  Basically, if you don't know anything about technology, this book will be of no use, as much of it will gloss over what you need to learn, and if you are already a competent computer user, this book will be dated and provide scattered information that might have been helpful 5 years ago.  I would recomend not buying this book. If you are a teacher and want to see how technology can be used in your classroom (without learning useless information like what a POST is) I'd try Will Richardson's Blogs, Wikis and Podcasts. That was useful and interesting, while not being too technical 
 It all depends on who you are if you will like this book.  Republicans will like it but Democrats or people with brains won't. 
 For one to understand why Hemingway wrote a book of this caliber, it must  be understood that Sherwood Anderson, whom Hem parodied, had just had a  contract signed by Hemingway.  An offer had also been made by Scribner's  which was more prestiegeous of the two literary firms.  To get out of the  contract, Hem offered this book, which he knew would be turned down by  Anderson's firm, thus giving Hemingway the chance to accept Scribner's  contract.  The book was not intended as a great literary work, and thus  must be examined in the light of which it is written.  There are many funny  idosyncrasies which Hem used for some of the characters in the book.  Most  of these came from people he knew there in Paris.  Entertaining?  Yes it  was to me.  A great literary work?  It achieved what he was looking for.   So you be the judge 
 I just received my wallet today and must say that I am very disappointed. First of all, it doesn't have enough compartments.  It might be ok for someone who only carries an ID and 4 additional cards and nothing else. The card slots are very tight and not made to fit more than one card in the same slot.  There is no spare key holder and no storage behind the ID card window.  The fabric inside the billfold is so thin you can see right through it.  This wallet is cheaply made, unlike the Fossil I currently own, which has held up for over 5 years.  What a waste of an Amazon.com gift certificate 
 This is a great book, if you want your child to think of all kinds of great things you can do with your hands.  but..If you are looking for a book to teach your child WHY you should not hit or anything about feeling and emotions involve in hitting than this is NOT the book for you 
 Jung is loopy. Jungian psychology is loopy. Jungian psychologists are  loopy. It surprises me that people take this stuff as seriously as they do.  Maybe there's a good Jungian explanation for that too. That said, Jung was,  in my opinion, the Wagner of early psychology, and, like Wagnerian opera,  there's a lot to be learned by mulling over some of the ideas presented  therein. But remember, Jung was more of a Romantic philosopher than a  psychologist. Colorful stuff. Just don't take it too seriously 
 A rather disappointing read since the book fails to adequately deal with the politics of the period. House's argument that oppositional painting is necessarily political is not only flawed but little evidence is offered in support of his argument, an argument which goes something like this: many impressionist works and also those by Manet explicitly reject preordained hierachies of  value in terms of both legibility of subject matter and technique,they are thus subversive,disruptive and oppositional and as a result political. I had expected the book to address in a more explicit, detailed and concrete manner the relationship of art produced at the time to politics. However, many of the descriptions of the works themselves are enlightening and chapter 4, 'The Viewer of Modern Life' is well worth a read.   
 The Power of Gold is full of amazing and entertaining stories, so much so that I started to get suspicious about the scholarship of the work. I haven't got the patience to track down every story, but suffice it to say that the one story I did bother to research turned out to be bunk. On pp. 29-30, Bernstein describes a meeting between Solon and Croesus. I recall that Nassim Nicholas Taleb, in his book "Fooled by Randomness" (p. 10 of FBR) mentions that it "was chronologically impossible for the two men to have been the same location." Turns out, Taleb was right (no surprise there), but this casts serious doubt on the many wonderful stories that Bernstein blithely reports as fact. Bernstein should rename his book, "The Power of Cute Fairy Tales about Gold." 
 I got this record just resently and it plain out sux!Their old stuff is the best!!!The cd has only 3 rocking songs and that's it.Do yourself a favor and buy their singles album.This is so not worth the money

 This product is great at exfoliating, not so great at hair removal.  Your skin will be silky smooth, but still have hair.  The hair that is removed doesn't stay gone long.  And it's tricky to maneuver into the curvier parts of your body.  It will definitely have to be used in conjunction with another product.  
 I bought this book expecting an adventure.  I have heard of the rare person who remembers in full detail previous lives and existences.  So I was expecting a great book.  I was disapointed.  From the beginning nothing seemed to ring true.  I kept waiting for the book to come alive, but it never did.  The book just kept dredging along.  Everything seemed flacid and boring.  Descriptions seemed usurped from modern day knowledge.  The mysteries revealed were weakly described.  The rare description of the afterlife and the laws of karma were wrong.  While some preliminary research was probably done into the subject matter, in my opinion this book is nothing more than a stale attempt at fiction.  It's information rather than intuited was invented 
 The analysis described in the book is a start for an individual investor to do their own research and it points to some useful resources. But the depth of the analysis and process is not enough. Following this process would not be sufficient to replace an analysis by a professional analyst, provided the analyst is objective. In other words, one can not "fire the stock analyst" simply by following what the book says.  Some criteria mentioned in the book are also abitrary, superficial. For example, it says slow growth would be sales growth of 30% or less. A sustainable of sales growth of 30% is extraordinary in real life. The book also gives different processes for growth and value investors, where growth and value should be integral parts of any analysis 
 I'm about to write a review that makes me sad because I have really enjoyed other books by Huston Smith. I respect his willingness and ability to explore diverse religious traditions and practices. His book "The World's Religions" is THE classic introduction to the topic. In fact, if you haven't read that book, then please don't buy this one; click over to that one, which is really a very good book.  This book, on the other hand, is very disappointing. We don't like to see our heros make big mistakes; but that's what this book is.  The essence of Smith's book is that religion matters because science alone cannot deliver meaning. Nor can material consumption, nor purely secular scholarship. So far so good. I agree with Smith that scientific knowledge and material consumption alone are totally inadequate to form a meaningful approach to life. We also agree that extreme postmodernism--with the idea that all attempts to find or articulate knowledge about the world are ultimately mere power plays--is not always true.  But we disagree about the status of human values. Smith believes they have no value unless they exist externally from human psychology. But I, with many others, argue that on the contrary my values and experiences stand on their own as meaningful and real. We might be wrong, but at least he should make that case rather than just stating his opinion.  Certainly the mainstream religious worldviews assume that the most important source of values is out there, in the existence of gods or ancestors or something like that. But all the great mystical traditions of the world teach that the truth that matters, the most important or most real truth, is within us. It is not out there in the world, and we do not need to look out there for anything. Whatever supernatural stuff out there exists or not doesn't matter: the great spiritual realities and truths that we need and enjoy are within us.   With that in mind, the inability of science to find and measure ghosts, gods or Platonic forms doesn't matter. In a very real sense, science has done spirituality a favor by empirically freeing us from supernatural entanglements and confusion. Look no more out there!   But Smith (like many religious people, unfortunately) cannot accept it. He cannot believe in his values unless they exist outside of himself, unless they would exist even in the absense of humanity. I think this is not only a philosophical error, but also a failure of courage. He cannot maintain the rationality of his values unless he shares them with rocks and the vacuum of space.   So, he has a big beef with science. Science has failed to find any supernatural thing; and so far the world has been understood remarkably well with natural explanations. That is not what most religious people would have expected, but as the mystical traditions knew, it doesn't have to matter.  He keeps referring to us as, for instance, a "razor-thin veneer on the world of dead matter." This is certainly not the only response to science! In fact most scientists regard the universe as wonderful and fascinating (not just dead matter), and us as wonderful beings, blessed with the ability to experience these marvels. He quotes a bunch of existentialists to support his pessimistic evaluation of science, but ultimately the existentialists (like most scientists) came to the right conclusion:   Spirituality, values, hopes, fears, etc... don't matter to scientific theories! Who cares? They matter to me! And I assume they matter to you too! Well, fine, that's what we need.  He burns scientists such as Ursula Goodenough, E. O. Wilson, and Stephen Jay Gould for having this insight. No doubt he would trash many others if he knew about them. But Smith's inability or unwillingness to share in this humanistic nobility is his worst flaw.  His wrongful hatred of science leads to a mistake about the origins of modern materialism. In his mind, "The line that runs from a materialistic wordlview to a materialistic philosophy of life is not a straight one, but it exists all the same" (48). Most people today seem to believe that they can buy happiness, if only they have enough money; but most of those people believe in God. And even when religion dominated politics and culture most people were materialistic (yes, even in "the mystic East"). Modern marketing is not taking advantage of a new human nature, but the same one that we've had since the neolithic (at least).  So he terribly misunderstands the nature of human values. Sadly, although that is central to his case, there are still more shortcomings.   He declares that what "religion, and philosophy, and art, and common sense, and our deepest intuitions, and our practiced imaginations... have said about the Big Picture throughout human history has shaken down into a single, wondrously clear and inspiring worldview." Wow, that is remarkable. I'd like a description of this. I think there is a great deal of diversity.   But Smith maintains that the great tradition teaches the immortality of the soul as a source of human hope. Hmmm. Not in ancient Greece, not in ancient Israel, not in many other pre-agricultural societies, and not in contemporary Judaism. For Hindus and Buddhists, the immortality of the soul is the greatest spiritual problem: they are doing their best to stop being reincarnated. Many other differences like this could be enumerated. Although there are some basic features of human worldviews everywhere, I don't see the agreement he promised. And neither do the overwhelming majority of the world's religious people.  And that brings me to a criticism I really hate to make, because Smith has done more than perhaps anyone else to bring knowledge of the world's religions to the average person. Smith's worldview in this book is not some great universal human tradition, but simply liberal monotheism; probably Christianity. He enriches it with a diverse sprinkling of other religions, but he merely brings them all under the umbrella of an implicit Christianity, not taking their traditions seriously. I've never seen him so negligent of other religions, so loyal to Christianity. Now Christianity is a great religion, but it's not the only worldview in human history, and not even the primary one or necessarily the greatest one. If Smith titled the book "Why Christianity Matters" and was honest about his bias, this wouldn't be a complaint. But he says the book is about all of humanity's traditions, and that's what we would expect from Smith. But it's implicitly dismissive of Zen, Taoism, Buddhism (especially Theravada), Hinduism, many ancient religious traditions, and many traditions of hunter-gatherer people.  I have one more criticism. A number of scholars in Smith's field have been accused of indifference to, or actually supporting, very bad regimes. Now, many religious people have stood up to such regimes bravely and fiercely; Bonhoeffer is just one of many examples.  Smith writes, "If a two-year-old drops her ice-cream cone, that tragedy is the end of the world for her. Her mother knows that this is not the case. Can there be an understanding of life so staggering in its immensity that, in comparison to it, even gulags and the Holocaust seem like dropped ice-cream cones?"  No. Because the human beings destroyed by those tragedies are inherently valuable, unique and irreplaceable, while ice cream cones are not. Smith's failure to perceive that leads me to suspect he shares some of that indifference to human life. Who would compare the value of human beings to ice cream cones? Really, when you think about who would, Smith suddenly finds himself in some very scary company.  In Smith's defense, he's gotten pretty old, and that perhaps a younger sharper Smith wouldn't have made a lot of these assumptions and comments. His only important and valuable point is that we have to look for fulfilment outside of materialistic possessions and experiences.   I conclude by emphasizing my original point: this book is worthless, but other books by Smith, especially "The World's Religions," are wonderful books that I strongly recommend. 
 The author is obviously as out of her element as Inspector Monk, and clearly has little knowledge of the ships, seafaring, nautical quarantine requirements, etc. of the 1860's.  Her characters are hardly believable:  Sutton, the rat exterminator and Dr. Crow are perhaps the worst examples, but not the only ones.  Would a proper young lady be picked up in a cab without a chaperon to go to a function?  Very disappointing 
  While I admit to occasionally using the phrase "in the trenches" to describe software development, I generally consider military analogies to be inappropriate descriptors of how software is created. A military organization is composed of a rigid command hierarchy where orders are not to be questioned. No software development shop could ever be run in this manner. Military subordinates can be screamed at, ridiculed and within general guidelines that are sometimes exceeded, abused. Once again, that strategy does not work in the business world.  The worst military analogy offense in the book is chapter ten, "Psychological Warfare." While keeping a team functional using psychological techniques is a well-known tactic, the means of psychological warfare are completely different. The authors admit this when in the chapter they utter the sentence; "Mastery of these techniques should provide tools for effective persuasion in both group situations and face-to-face interactions." There are many problems in that sentence. An argument that techniques used to psychologically weaken an enemy in warfare will prove effective in working with team members in a business setting is absurd. Also, there is the key word "should", a weak word indicating that the authors are not convinced that these tactics will work.   This absurdity also appears on the back cover in the form of the blurb, "With hands-on exercises, real-life war stories and a take-no-prisoners attitude, `Software Architect Bootcamp, Second Edition', won't just help . . . " I have no idea how the authors of this book conduct their businesses, but in the development teams I have worked with, that kind of tactic destroys the consensus necessary for people to work together effectively. In fact, I have no idea what a "take-no-prisoners attitude" is supposed to mean in a software development environment.   While I found the military wording to be an unnecessary distraction, there is some good advice in the book. Using architecture in the same sentence as software is a relatively new phenomenon. Recently, the complexity of applications has grown to the point where developers have split into different areas. There are still people who write the code, but now there are others whose fulltime job is to develop and manage the overall structure of the application. These people, commonly called software architects, need to be trained in ways completely different from the code writers. While they need to learn how to put software components together, they also need to be trained in how to articulate their vision and convince people by rational argument. The authors cover the different aspects of software architecture and end each chapter with a set of essay questions that are partially answered.   I really have ambivalent feelings about this book; it does contain a great deal of useful information regarding software architecture. However, the absurd analogies weaken it when compared to others, so that is why I only give it two stars. I would not use it to train software architects 
 Much over rated,apart from the lovely 'magic hollow' - and very short. Buy the 'best of' instead

 I am giving this one star ONLY because it is on VHS and not DVD.  I don't even own a VCR anymore and had to watch it at someone elses house!!  The day that they come out with all ten seasons on DVD I will buy them all and really wish I could now!  I just bought the pilot episode on DVD and am hoping that this will sell well and that they'll go on to put all the seasons on DVD already.  I know there is still a huge worldwide fan base who would purchse them!! 
 Don't get me wrong.. I got sucked in by Daylight too.. but the fact is.. Aesop Rock is NOT Canibus. His lyrics DO NOT make sense.. his lyrics have never made any cohesive sense for more than two bars at a time.  The only songs even remotely worth keeping on this album are No Regrets, which is actually surprisingly well written, the excellent Daylight, and 9-5er's Anthem which is also average.  Check out Bazooka Tooth, it's Aesop's most well-produced and written album 
 If you felt the quality really dropped off in the second half of the third season, you ain't seen nothing. The forth season shows a complete disregard to the elemements that made Sealab wonderful in it's prime.... it always had the veneer of cohesion that made it worthwhile. Season four is just stoner trash, and hey, speaking as a stoner........ it's bad s&*t man 
 Titan A.E. should have been an epic movie full of thought provoking ideas. With talents like the legendary Don Bluth on animation, skilled sci-fi screenwriters like Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) and Ben Edlund (The Tick) writing the screenplay and stars like Matt Damon, Drew Barrymore, Bill Pullman and Nathan Lane doing voice over work and a [...]dollar budget the movie had all the elements of a hit. Unfortunately all these talented individuals failed to become successful when brought together on this project. Titan A.E. is an uninspired mess of a movie with a predictable story, dated looking animation, flat acting and primitive looking CGI. Thanks in part to the box office failure of this movie and several others like Treasure Planet and Atlantis, hand drawn animated movies are currently not being produced by American movie studios. A shame because there are so many great stories to tell using this art form.  Titan A.E. follows the story of Cale, a young boy in the year 3028 or something. Cale's father has built a spaceship The Titan, which can recreate an Earth like planet when activated. Big blue off the shelf computer generated aliens known as The Drej find out about the Titan and go to Earth to destroy it. During a final onslaught on the planet, Cale's father gives his son to an alien to care for along with a ring then gets on another ship. The Titan escapes along with a few million human survivors. Five-year-old Cale helplessly watches as the Drej blow up Earth and kill his father. So bleak, so boring so predictable.  Cut to fifteen years later. Cale a young man now, is working a crummy job at a space station. True to formula, he's angry and disillusioned drifting through life with no direction. After an unappetizing lunch of living creatures, Cale runs afoul of some human hating aliens. He's about to get pummeled when he conveniently he runs into Korso, a man who says he's been searching the galaxy for fifteen years for him on his quest to find the Titan. He activates a code in Cale's ring and conveniently the Drej head to the station to kill him. It would have been helpful to give the bad guys some character development here. I find it odd how the Drej found Cale at the same time as Korso but not for the past fifteen years despite being smart enough to blow up a planet. Cale and Korso shoot it out with the Drej to escape the space station, but the bug like cook who served lunch is a casualty of the assault. They hotwire a spaceship which gets damaged as it leaves the station and make a thrilling jump into space without spacesuits. Too bad this makes no sense scientifically. Their bodies would have exploded from the pressure before they asphyxiated.  The movie goes on in spite of this minor plothole. On board Korso's ship Cale meets the attractive Akima, who looks both hot and edgy along with other members of Korso's alien crew. The quest for the Titan begins and the slowly paced movie starts to get even slooower, changing into a ninety minute long chase where we watch Cale and Akima start a lukewarm romance, shooting, arguing between Cale and the crew, arguing between Cale and Akima, arguing between Cale and Korso, two brief scenes where nudity is teased, and just more arguing and shooting leading to Predictable plot twist #1: Korso is working for the Drej and plans on destroying the Titan when they find it. True to formula, Korso gets a change of heart and sacrifices himself and Cale activates the Titan after learning predictable plot twist #2: Drej are beings of pure energy and they would power the Titan when it recreates the Earth like planet. Cale figures this out in record time and recreates the planet calling it "Bob". The movie ends and I shed a tear as I watch an opportunity to make something truly innovative in the Science Fiction genre wasted by a bunch of people who have the talent to do much better. Titan A.E. fails as a science fiction movie because of a poorly written script that has the plot and character development of a bad 1980's Saturday morning cartoon. Edlund and Whedon's weak screenplay plays everything safe and takes no risks in telling Cale's story. Movies in the Science Fiction genre always take risks exploring the worlds they inhabit and exploring the personalities of the characters who live in the universe. There was a story to tell here, but the writers focused on the wrong characters and the wrong plot points. The real story should have been with Cale's father not Cale. I wanted to know why he made the Titan and why was there a need to create a new Earth like planet. Could Earth have been overpopulated and scientists felt they needed a new world was the solution to handle the masses? Did the energy based Drej fear Earthmen exploiting their race as power source for the Titan? Perhaps Drej spies read about slavery in ancient American history texts and colonization of foreign lands during the colonial period and felt the need for a pre-emptive strike. These were deeper reasons for an intergalactic planet destroying war and should have been the focus of the movie's overall plot. Production wise, Titan A.E. is subpar. Bluth's hand-drawn animation for Fox looks horribly outdated when put side to side with the work of other animators at the competing animated studios of Disney, DreamWorks and Warner Brothers in the same year. Bluth's backgrounds are often too dark and character movements over exaggerated. Bluth, true to his style over the past thirty years focuses too much on wide shots of flailing of limbs to express character emotion and not on close-ups of facial expressions to tell his story. Watch any of Bluth's Disney films (Robin Hood, The Fox and the Hound) or his 90's Fox films (Anastasia, The Land Before Time, An American Tail) to see how little his style has changed with the times. The CGI has no detail and doesn't blend into the backgrounds smoothly. The Drej and their ships look like they belong in another film not here in Titan A.E. Compare the animation in Titan A.E. to DreamWorks' Road to El Dorado released that same year. Road does everything Titan A.E wanted to do from a technical standpoint blending CGI and animation beautifully. Brad Birds' work on Warner's Iron Giant features a well-written story and is a brighter film with lively human characters and beautiful backgrounds. Disney's later efforts like Kim Possible and Lilo and Stitch have more engaging characters and utilize unique animated character designs. Titan A.E. with its looks and feels like a 1980's movie not a 2000 theatrical release.  Fox was setting up Titan A.E. to be a sci-fi classic that pushed the genre of hand-drawn animated films into the adult themed direction of Japanese Manga. Ironically, the failure of these "riskier" hand-drawn animated movies like Fox's Titan, A.E., DreamWorks Road to El Dorado, Warner's The Iron Giant, Disney's Treasure Planet and Atlantis halted the production of hand-drawn animated films in America for the time being. Because American studios and audiences continue to see hand-drawn animated films as children's fare filmmakers cannot push the envelope and tell the adult themed stories of their Japanese counterparts. Until American movie studios and audiences change their perceptions about hand-drawn animation, filmmakers will never be able to make hand-drawn animated movies with mature themes and expand the audience for the art form past small children. Pass this one by at the video store. Adults looking for an adult themed animated movie should Pick up the far superior Heavy Metal or Castle of Cogliostro and preteens looking for a non-Disney animated film can pick up the superior Road to El Dorado, The Iron Giant or The Prince of Egypt. 
 Maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the Russian President and Jack Ryan are talking to each other through the computer, repeat is spelled "reapeat".  On top of that, the acting was horrible...this movie didn't take itself seriously enough.  Ben Affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in Pearl Harbor

 This is perhaps the most expensive book besides collectables. Judging from the size and amount of information, it probably worths $5 - but I had to buy it simply because the professor uses it as textbook. Granted that this is a book for business management professionals or to-be's, but this does not mean the book should be this expensive. You'll know what I mean when you see the book. I think they they are taking advantage of that fact that most people buy this book get reimbursed - my self for one will get reimbursement from my company, but I resent the fact that I have to buy such an expensive book and waste my company's money only because I have to. This is robbery - it's not printing book, it's more like printing money 
 (2.5 Stars) When I first began reading WH, I was turned around a bit on the chracters as well some language styles, so I decided to cheat and check out the list of characters that was in the back. I soon realized how unhelpful it was and very disappointed by its lack of contributing nothing more than the obvious. What I mean is, instead of helping me deciphor who was who and in relation to one antoher, in which a geneology would have been better, they merely gave very short snippets of description that was actually in the text itself. I got through all the relations by my friend who supplied me with a genology chart.  There were also endnotes that state the obvious as well and it was very tedious to have to keep flipping back to see if they would clarify anything. One character speaks in special Englilsh dialect that was difficult to read and understand. The author suggests that you just need to read it aloud and you'll understand it. Granted, that's true, but a translation in the endnotes would have been nice too.   There is a timeline at the beginning, which is nice but I'm not sure what the point of it was and it seemed randomly placed. At the back again, there is a short discussion on the motifs/themes of the book. It was somewhat enlightening but they point out things the reader would have picked up anyway. But, one thing that was really interesting was that there was a short essay on how the book was received from Bronte's time as well into modern times. The short bio at the beginning was done well though.  The overall language of the book was modernized while still keeping certain dialec and stylistic elements of Bronte that didn't really work well. It was very awkward at times but nevertheless, very readable.   Someone who wants a less intimidating introduction to Bronte or any classical works will find this book helpful (& others in this series). But for those of you who are used to a more strict classical interpretation with a more academic flavor, this is NOT the book for you. You will find it somewhat dull, unchallenging and tedious. The language is not very sophisticated nor reminiscent of the linguistic era (which I enjoy, you may not, so...)  The STORY of WH was fascinating. I both hated it and loved it. There were times when I just wanted to chuck the book across the room because I found it SO vile, the charcters so enraged and violent, selfish and horrible. I haven't feld that way since I read Ann Rice's 'Memnoch the Devil'. I've never read a more passionate and fierceer book; and while I read, I was both dreading it yet couldn't wait to see what happened.   I read this several days ago and I'm still buzzing from it. The confusion of the names is a very interesting device, clever and sly. Bronte was ahead of her time, fusing both the gothic novel with supernatural, dramatic and tragic styles. The evolution of 3 generations was so complex yet the progression of each was so vivid and stand out on their own. I haven't decided if I hate or love Heathcliff and Catherine, if even I can forgive them for their nature. And the wonderful way that Bronte wrote was not just the language of words but in the way she used the wilderness of the moors as a description of their wild selves.  
 The book explained the concepts of the subject well enough, but the number of typos in the problems and in the answer key led to many hours of frustration. I was often under the impression I was doing something wrong, only to find out the givens in a problem had incorrect prefixes, or some other error 
 I have been readung daily meditations/modivational readings for as long as I can remember.  I find this this is probably the most useful in that it covers all aspects of one's life.  I find myself unconsciously nodding my head as I read.  I would highly recommend this book to all of my friends.  It is amazing how much better your day is when you get your brain primed early in the day 
 I was so excited when I bought this book.  Dispair set in once I disovered the focus was on stay at home moms of very young children.  I couldn't get past all of the examples of the trails and tribulatiions of "new moms" to focus on the 24/7 balancing act of working moms

 If you are expecting the Disney's Mary Poppins, you are best making another reading selection.  Unfortunately, my expectations may have tainted my reading experience.  The book is filled with fun imaginative adventures children would enjoy.  However, Mary Poppins is stern and hard.  Her tightly guarded compassionate side does pop up during different events, but overall she treats the Bank's children with a harsh and sometimes demeaning hand 
 Joe Nickell is a very interesting character and has, without doubt, a lot of experience in investigation and trickery. He is the perfect sceptic. He also has assumedly a lot a friends in science, who are able to disprove several of his mentioned "alleged supernatural occurrences". So some of the chapters are very interesting and and the solutions he provides are looking plausible (i.e. Nazca Lines). It is fun reading these chapters.  In other cases his attempts to explain the reader, that something is indeed not mysterious or supernatural, is only a listing of assumptions and possible explanations without any scientific evidence (i.e. Wynchester House). I agree to him, that most of the occurences are explainable without the need of some mysterious background. What, in my opinion is a pity, is, that he complains, that most of the cited people have a strong fantasy and are not going to look for scientific explanations, but he is doing the same from his perspective.  In the the whole book I did not find the consideration, that some things are not supernatural, but in our days still mysterious, because our scientifc knowledge lacks of some things not discovered so far or methods not developed, yet. He is only searching for a prove for his doubts and if he cannot find one, claiming that it is disproved with providing a lot of assumptions (fantasy) without any scientifc evidence (i.e. acupucture stated as an example of intuitive healing).  As a good investigator, he should be more open minded to all possibilites and not only focused on trying to disprove everything 
 I no longer work for  Hill & Blume   Surveyors,   Sydney (!!!!!). 
 There is a subgenre of travel writing in which a sheltered, white kid from a middle class background travels to a foreign country, usually as a volunteer, and goes through a predictable set of phases. It starts with loneliness and despair, laments of the "what am I doing here?" variety; then a sudden awakening to the opportunity to experience a completely different culture; the realization of the changes the experience has wrought on the author; and then either the sadness at having to depart or going native.   The books are full of stories meant to illustrate the cultural differences that are almost like mad-libs, you just fill in the blanks: In America we [do something] but here in [insert country here] they [do something else]! Isn't that wacky! It's intensely annoying and usually more about the author than about the author's experiences. Jamie Zeppa's "Beyond the Sky and the Earth: A Journey into Bhutan" is not just an example of that type of book, it stretches the style to the nth degree.  She's a Canadian girl who took a job teaching in Bhutan, an exotic and mysterious destionation even amongst travellers. But she seems strangely uninterested in her surroundings. A three-hour hike is torture to her. She visits the capital cities and her fellow volunteers ... and that's about it. She's done a little reading but makes little effort to learn the country by exploring on her own.  Apparently she's oblivious to the way she portrays herself. She's not likeable or credible as an observer. She is totally self-absorbed and fussy. There's one remarkable exchange that makes her look so bad that it's a wonder it found its way into the book.   She has a friend of whom she writes "If it weren't for Shakuntala, I would be very alone here." After an anonymous sexual encounter with a complete stranger who knocks on her door in the middle of the night she expresses her shame to her friend, who is packing to go home to visit her dying father. Zeppa asks her friend if she thinks her mystery man will tell others. "Jamie," her friend says. "My father is dying."  Shortly thereafter she meets a man she likes a great deal. She meets him on page 217 and the rest of the book, through page 303, is devoted almost entirely to the romance. Nearly a third of the book! She goes into a level of detail that is excruciating. What's worse, the love story reveals almost nothing about Bhutan. It's a generic "clash of cultures" romance. The book changes from a daily diary into a Harlequin romance. At no point does it feel like a true travel memoir. What a wasted opportunity.   
 These sheets are aweful.  They are so wrinkly and stiff.  I should have listened to all of the other reviewers when  they said the same thing.  TRUST   me.  They're not worth the money not matter how good the deal sounds 
 Kyle Played guitar with Dr Know early on. He is a ripping guitarist too. Then he played guitar and sang after everyone realized he is a better singer too. Dr Know wasn't much until Kyle took over, a few songs on a some Mystic comps. Plug in Jesus, is what really got Dr Know going. Brandon just reemerged when being a punk wocka got really trendy. Check out his teen beat style posters. Ughhh.  I saw them with Brandon and the whole show sucked. Maybe one of the worst I've seen, and I've been going to hardcore shows for over 20 years   Then he does the DK Kennedy's thing trying yet again to flog a dead horse. Although I don't blame the guys for trying to recoupe some of the dough that Jello ripped them off for. Jello sucks too. He is so impressed with what a smart guy he thinks he is. He is just a con man too.  Any way Brandon isn't a totally bad guy. He just sucks as a singer. As a skater he's OK. Any way his brother sang for Stallag 13 which isn't to bad of a band.  But, if you are talking Dr Know it is all about Kyle. He made the band what they are. With his distinctive guitar style and then the singing. He was the driving force behind every record they put out until this new living of the corpse of hardcore thing started happening.   Now if Doug Moody would quite being an Ass and rerelease more of the old mystic stuff. Sure I have the records, but who wants to bust out the turntable these days. 
 The first two songs are amazing, the rest of the cd lags. I cant think of what else to write hah 
 This book has a lot of great examples of illustration, but the layout of the book is way too confusing. I found myself often lost where I should continue to read. The intro for interface has very little help for the beginner to start this program. This book might be good reference for advanced users, but not for beginners. Maybe the author wants to make a nice-looking book, but this book is over-designed, lack of functionality . I would recommend video tutorial from Lynda.com, it's ideal for beginners who never used Corel Painter and Wacom drawing tablets 
 Normally I enjoy reading this type of stuff, but this guy is just plain terrible,one of the most bizzare,abstract,pieces i've ever read.Everything here is self absorbed,non-linear nonsense.  I will stick with Nick Kent,Jim Derogatis,Chuck Eddy or just about anyone,before I slog thru this heap of poop again.horsesh** 
 Will someone PLEASE produce a DVD/VHS re-make of DIVA with the excellent sound quality deserving of this film!? I was so excited to finally find this movie, but quickly realized after reading reviews from fellow fans, that it would be a disappointment and waste of my money to purchase it. I hope the word gets back to whoever reproduced this movie and they'll re-issue a quality DVD and/or video soon 
 ... for those with any intelligence what so ever a pointless read.  Vincent points out all of the obvious connections to Kings other works.   There was no interview with the author to speak of... There was no new insight into the characters or about the worlds.  Disappointing through and through 
 I found this book to be nothing more than an instant replay of Maher's television shows. But then that's exactly what it's advertised to be. We should give thanks when we end up with something that's as advertised. It's just that after six years of Bush and Cheney, the truth is boring.  True, this is more of a soapbox than a review, but that's okay since I'm a registered Republican. George W. Bush has decreed that we're not governed by the same rules and laws as everyone else. It wasn't that long ago that Bush bashing was one of the loneliest jobs in the world. Now, if you're not careful, you'll get trampled under by the androids and politicians who are trying to distance themselves from Bush, Cheney and America's Dachau--Abu Ghraib and the Iraqi holocaust 
 Hype Williams is the greatest music video director of all time. This, however, does not automatically mean the transition to film is going to be a good one.  The movie is not good. I don't know if it's supposed to be a black Scarface or what, but it's really bad.  Rappers are not known for their Oscar-worthy work, and Nas and DMX are no exception. DMX has charisma, but he needs to work on remembering he's reciting lines, not rapping.  I love T-boz, but she needs to stick to her day job.  Taral Hicks is a good actress, but her talents are wasted here. I don't buy her as a bad girl.  I know The Godfather was an inspiration for Hype, but his attempt to give the movie a dark tint backfired. He made it too dark. Everytime I see the movie, I mistakenly think I'm looking at a bootleg or something.  Hype should start over in film by directing material written by someone else 
 i like all of derek's albums to one degree or another and have heard his planet x stuff as well. blood is by far his worst and most boring work. the synth tones and note choices are redundant and unnecessarily overplayed. some of the guitar work as the song with john petrucci is okay but too much sax and non-metal sounds abound this cd. derek plays too much unmelodic stuff and the vocal tracks are blah. in the summertime with billy idol is laughable indeed. the song with zakk is ok i guess. i recommend you check out inertia and the first album by derek. this one seems rushed and boring. 
 To mimic a sentence structure that Mr. Epstein employs ad nauseum throughout his book, a perfect storm of smug vapidness, this.  The author seems to think that he can innoculate himself against the charge of being a snob himself, by admitting to it once in a while.  Fair enough.  But it doesn't keep him from coming off as mean (as in his treatment of the author Phyllis Rose--how ironic that he would talk about her coming across as a snob in her wonderful memoir!) and judgemental (as in his treatment of vegetarians whom, and he annoyingly waffles on this one, he seems to conclude are a self-righteous lot who has made throwing dinner parties a nuisance).    Mr. Epstein is at his worst when he goes on about his fascination with fashionable coats and cigarette lighters.  Boring.  And pitiable, really.  Sorry, but Mr. Epstein's own glaring snobbery overshadows this book of warmed over observations on the subject. 
 I have been reading Danielle Steel since her first book was published and this is by far her worst one yet. Over the past few years her writing has deterioriated rapidly. It's almost as if she doesn't care anymore; she knows readers will buy her books no matter how poorly they're written.   The storyline for Coming Out is a dual one: A woman's twin teenaged daughters' invitations to a "coming out" ball (somewhat like a debutante presentation), and her son's "coming out" by announcing he is gay at the "coming out" ball. Along the way, one of the twins refuses to attend the ball, the other one loves the idea, her five year old son by her 2nd (and current) husband comes down with Chicken Pox, one of the twin daughters' long, white gloves for the ball are damaged, and her mother-in-law falls and breaks her ankle. Her husband is Jewish, her mother-in-law is a Holocaust survivor, her ex-husband is a gambler and alcoholic, his wife is a bimbo, and her oldest son is gay. I think she covered all the "politically correct" demographics. Even so, the characters are shallow, one dimensional and boring. The writing is simplistic, repetitive and amatuerish.  Steel used to write fascinating, wonderful to read books such as A Perfect Stranger, The Ring, Message from Nam, Wings, etc., but not lately.  [... 
 Eve Dallas is a cop in the future, chasing drug dealers, killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general. Her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of Eve's rich husband and ends up dead.I hated this book, the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags 
 I had read this book many years ago and enjoyed it. The book was written 100 years ago, but does hold some truths of the world today. However, it appears to be a reproduction, the book was rather expensive for what I got - a slim paper back full of typo' 
 I'm very sorry, but the universal remote control was not what I expected.Like, when I want to turn on my tv. the vcr came on and visa versa.  But the company was very helpful and quick to let me send it back and refunded me my money.Very pleased about the service,thanks.Regards Yoka van Dijk. 
 I would not advise buying this book for studying for the SCEA exam. It is very badly written and not clear at all. Much of the material is repeated and long-winded. It contains some of the most useless diagrams I've seen in a long time. I would recommend the Mark Cade book and some of the notes and files that are available from other people who sat the exam. (mainly from the Yahoo groups and JavaRanch). The good points of the book are that there are plenty of practice questions and a sample exam.  
 I'm not sure what I expected, but I vaguely remember James Frey, author of "A Million Little Pieces" saying this was one of his top five reads; I couldn't believe it!  I must confess that my mother and I (she's a young 83, I'm 48) have created our own little "Book Club" that is bi-coastal - it gives us one more thing to talk about when we chat on the phone.  At least she finished it; disappointed!  Every time I picked it up it seemed to wander aimlesslesly from one subject to the other, without much regard to the pace.  I felt I was constantly on siesta!  From now on we're sticking to the classics - this felt utterly pointless 
 Ick. I hated this CD. The first few songs were good, but the rest just sound like a motion picture soundtrack. What a waste of money 
 Somewhat useful book in that it pulls together the info that is readily available on the internet, particularly from state government websites 
 I can't remember ever reading a  book that I enjoyed less. The Easy person is so forced that no one would or could believe him. I,ve read other books by Mosley, but this, Easy Rawlins should just go away. 
 While this story is truly an essential writing of Dostoevsky, it lacks the appropriate context to be read as sold in this copy.  If you are interested in reading "The Grand Inquisitor" without reading the rest of The Brothers Karamazov, I would recommend the Guignon edition, sold for only a little more.  This work includes the two chapters preceeding "The Grand Inquisitor" as well as what Dostoevsky intended as the refutation for this tale, "The Russian Monk," which follows this legend.  Dostoevsky did not intend for this to be separated from the book as a whole, but I think it could be legitimately done when read with a little more context than is present in this copy.  Additionally, this alternate edition includes a very complete introduction by Charles Guignon, which is much more informative than the brief one by Anne Fremantle provided in this copy.  It is important to remember that "The Grand Inquistor" was not Dostoevsky's final answer in The Brothers Karamazov.  Reading this edition alone provides a flawed view of both Dostoevsky's writing and philosophy and The Brothers Karamazov.  I would recommend reading the book as a whole instead [and I particularly recommend the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation for that: it is much more accurate to the original Russian].  Or at a minimum, reading the other edition of this book.  Either way, you will get a more complete glimpse to the genius of Dostoevsky, which this fails to provide.  The Grand Inquisitor is truly an essential read, but not in this presentation of it 
 This book is not for young children.  I purchased this for my 5 year old who is just crazy about pirates and I was did not end up giving it to him.  Heed the age recommendations.  There are a few disturbing images of pirate punishment devices.  It is an informative and interesting book for older children though.  
 I heard "You're the One" one morning on my local radio station and just HAD to find out who the artist was.  Their online "last song played" service was down, so I came to Amazon.com to see if I could track it down, and low and behold I found Across the Winterline.  I immediately clicked on One Click Ordering and awaited it's arrival.  What a TOTAL disappointment.  "You're the One" is a wonderful piece of music.  There is no doubt that Jack Williams is a remarkably talented guitarist and vocalist.  I love his melodies, especially when he sticks close to his talent for no holds barred blues.  He has a great voice, gravelly, resonant and warm.  BUT . . .  With the exception of "Your the One" and maybe one or two other songs that escape me at the moment, his lyrics are just terrible.  Not just terrible, irritating, anoying doggerel.  They are full of some of the worst forced rhymes, trite cliches and cheap sentimental bromides I've ever heard.  Some of these lyrics are so bad they are painful to listen to.  If you can afford it, buy this CD and add "Your the One" to the blues list on your IPod, RealPlayer folder, or include it in a compilation CD you burn, and then throw this one away.  That's what I did.  Otherwise, just pass 
 Another parasite feeding off the leavings of much more substantial species.  Or perhaps a more apt ocean-related metaphor would be comparing Malkin's "work" to that of the brainless bivalves that cluster around sewer outflows, or the mindless jellyfish who flow with the ocean currents.  But like the ocean, neo-cons' writings should be taken with more than a grain of salt.  By the way, the reviewer below who wants someone named McCracken reported to Amazon.  I'm sure you can take it.  Instead, why don't you campaign for a zero-star feature for reviews.  Or perhaps a fact-checking service for publishers of political vitriol like this work of fiction.  I sure hope no public money has been spent on stuff like this 
 I bought this book because I need it for my His. class. From chap. # 1, I wanted to drop the class JUST BECAUSE THIS TBOOK.  Chapter 1: Referring to slaves and Native Americans "Within their own families and COMMUNITIES they made choices..."  My questions are  How many Slaves had choices??? What community of slaves?? Welcome to the Black Slave Community. The book is a joke  Slaves were not human for their owners. They were an expensive item. If the owner wanted to sell a Black baby, they were able to do it because the baby was the owner's property. The parents of this baby didn't have the "CHOICE" to say THIS IS MY CHILD. HE/SHE DOESN'T BELONGS TO YOU, SO YOU CAN NOT SELL HER/HIM. I think that this book and the authors do not respect Native Americans, African Americans and the history.  Also, the trade of Europeans with Native Americans . The book reads, "that the Indian was 'making sport of us Europeans.'" We, the people from America (the whole continent), lost everything we had in our trades. We didn't know the value of our gold, and we traded it for glass beads. So, What sport are we talking here? How this author want us to believe that we, people from America, fooled the Europeans 
 This product is way too expensive and very useless for people who can study straight from the book. This "tool" is a method for the producer to make it impossible for students to share books or buy used books. I hope people stop forcing students to buy this useless access code 
 I'm an attorney with many years' experience in the venture capital area. The content of the book tends to reflect East Coast practice more than West Coast (Silicon Valley) practice. That's not necessarily a flaw, but you should be aware that the styles can differ in some respects.  The style of writing though, is my major complaint about this book. In a word, it's pompous. Too many sentences have very complex, passive or impersonal constructions. Paragraphs are long and dense, without any concern for the reader's fatigue level.   Also, some quantitative concepts could have been much more clearly expressed with a simple formula (high school-level math). The discussion of weighted average antidilution protection at pp. 90-91 is a case in point. I found this impossible to understand when I first read it. The more I read it, the more obscure it became to me. It could have been described much more accurately, and in many fewer lines, with a simple fraction.  Clear communication didn't seem to be a priority for this author. 
 I had to read this book for a history course. It was interesting  at the beginning, until I see the picture of my Hmong friends. The author is pretty bias in some part of her writting. There are no evidences to support her term of Hmong means free. We are not free people we fought for our freedom just like any other less dominance race. You can not base an accurate study of the Hmong Culture based on interviews with Hmong peers and students. Though I do find the quote of other authors pretty well worded.  Although the Hmong did fight the Han-Chinese to reclaim their land, they never succeeded. Many Hmong philosophers were killed and written history were burned and destroyed by the Han- Chinese. There are no accurate documentation of Hmong history. All I have to say is, if a book is written about the Hmong, then I think its a new culture and race being created 
 Imagine someone combining the scripts for Zardoz and Independence Day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing....then you would have Battlefield Earth.  It is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars.  You become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of John Travolta putting his heart and soul into a project.   Just awful. If Battlefield Earth and Pluto Nash were humans they would deserve to be executed 
 To be fair there are a few good ideas but by and large - this is not a good book.   In addition - this book's attitude that 2nd time brides really should focus on tiny small weddings that no one will notice.  Bridal Bargains is much better and gives practical information. 
 If you like the Dirk Pitt series & the Kurt Austin series, don't bother reading this book! The action is NOT there, nor is the intrigue that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series.  This book was not as 'action-packed' as the two other series, and left me wishing the book to be over.  I had to 'make' myself finish the book, and even then, my only comment was "That's it?!" It's definitely NOT the 'page-turner' type story that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series. And, to be honest, I miss the 'cameo' appearances of the author in the Pitt novels 
 If this were a satirical view of Regency books, I might have bought the far-fetched storyline, the flat, idiotic characters, and the absolute silliness of the rather dull plot.  As I rather suspect it is not a satire - Catherine Coulter being a best-selling Romance novelist - it was disappointing to say the very least.  I only, I repeat, only listened to it in its entirety because I hadn't brought anything else to listen to at work one day.  If you like historical romance that's fun and funny, try Katie MacAlister's book "Improper English", or for some more serious historical fiction, check out Phillippa Gregory's Wideacre series 
 Simply put, this book is terrible.  It's advertised as "hard sci fi" but the ideas, not even to mention the story or characters, just aren't there.  The characters are all paper cutouts and the storyline drags very badly.  I kept checking the page number and thinking, "Is it possible I've read this many pages and still feel like the interesting part hasn't started yet?"  Worst of all, the "hard sci fi" consists of a Jovian gas-based society (which has been done much better by other authors) and nanotech machines, the Wheelers, which they simply *skip* actually describing in detail in the book!  By the end I felt scammed by the marketing of this book.  If you are looking for hard sci fi, do yourself a favor and buy anything by Vernor Vinge, Ian Banks, Greg Egan, or any of the many other authors writing much better works in this genre 
 The lids do not seal properly, and everything leaks when you are trying to pour the jello into the molds 
 This is a defective product by the publisher, otherwise it would rec a 5 of 5 stars.  The publisher repeated pg 145 twice missing pg 147.  Amazon replaced the first order only to receive a second order that was also defective and this is an essential part of the book in interpretating the last four cards. Until the publisher recalls the entire lot and fixes this I would not recommend purchasing the book 
 As I was reading this, I kept shaking my head.  This book didn't really give me a lot of help.  There really isn't much in here that I couldn't find in a lot of other, much better, books.  I found the advice to be plain wrong in some cases, ill-advised in others.  And the author's attitude bothered me.  It was off-putting.    It wasn't a really horrible book, which is why it got two stars, but I've read books that gave me a lot more help.  If you're insistent on buying this book, though, my copy will be up for sale.  :) 
  This is a complex and detailed history chiefly of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various U.S. administrations. In that sense, it is the story of two cities - Miami and Washington - and two peoples - Americans and Cubans.    I have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup.   The author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. It is, in that sense, a boring little disaster of a book.  
 If you visited with Vidal in "Myron" and "Live from Golgotha" then you'll find this book a tired re-hash of attempts to alter time and fun and games with historical characters.  Same blase and  cynical tone.  However, what this book sorely lacks is a character with the  style of Myra Breckinridge to handle the proceedings 
 The is by far the weakest Grisham novel I've ever read.  The first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist (Joel Backman; more about him later) wanders Italy for nearly 200 pages, learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with Italian carictatures that would make Chico Marx cringe.  When Grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense, it's all for naught, as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending.  As for Joel Backman, I can't think of a more unlikeable and unsympathetic protagonist in recent memory.  A disgraced lawyer, lobbyist and traitor that plowed through life in a meaningless quest for wealth and power, all the while causing numerous deaths, and alienating numerous wives and children is supposed to be someone we care about?  Does this character redeem himself in any meaningful fashion?  You read the book and decide.. 
 This movie, based on the Thomas Harris book, is a remake of the movie 'Manhunter.' The story leads up to the events of the popular Silence of the Lambs film. Red Dragon was remade because the studio wanted to cash in on the surprising popularity of Hanibal Lecter. Unfortunately the supply of Thomas Harris books was exhausted. So they revisited and retitled this prequel to the Silence of the Lambs. In Thomas Harris's book and the original Manhunter Dr. Lecter was an intriguing support character only. But now Hollywood has discovered that Hannibal's character brings in moviergoers so they take every opportunity in Red Dragon to add or lenghten scenes with Dr. Lecter and put him center stage.   The original Manhunter was a fine film directed by Michael Mann. It featured Brian Cox (Bourne Identity) as Dr. Lecter and William Peterson (CSI) as Special Agent Graham. This movie is lacking in all aspects to the original (and to the book). While Anthony Hopkins's portrayal is as good as Mr. Cox's Edward Norton is clearly out of his depth. He is unable to convey the complex emotional trauma that Agent Graham experiences when he assimilates the mindset of a sadistic killer who wipes out entire families. Performances by Harvey Keitel and Ralph Fiennes are also wasted here. My advice-buy or rent the original.      
 This was issued by the UN demanding Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait by January 1991. The section in this book about President George H.W. Bush's dealing with Iraq is too misinformative in that lacks too many vital facts about how bad Saddam was in his handling the invasion of Kuwait and why he invaded. Not mention of Saddam's great debts he owed Kuwait in 1990(from the Iran/Iraq he mostly started) or his attempt to make Kuwait the "19th province" of Iraq. Author Phillips makes it sound like Bush just wanted to kick Saddam out of Kuwait just to get a better name for himself (Bush). Phillips is also too sympathetic of Saddam's invasion of Kuwait (talking about Kuwait drilling a bit into Iraqi territory) like this merited an entire Kuwait invasion by Saddam.   We get no real indication of Saddam's terrible butchery of Kurds in Iraq in the 1980's and early 90's. Nor his bombing of Tel Aviv. Phillips talks of Saddam as a vicious strongman able to make Iraq steady. Not only is this too vague a reference to Saddam's massive evil deeds but it isn't true. During the Iran-Iraq war Saddam saw much of southern Iraq go up in flames due to invading Iranian armies in Iraq. Book, in short, is too hard on the older George Bush (and younger who dealt the final appropriate blow to Saddam) and too easy on Saddam. 
 My Jack Russell loved the ball, in fact when I would take it out, even before I turned it on she would go crazy trying to get it away from me.  It took her very little time to figure out how to "catch" the ball, then once she figured this out she chewed off the tips of all the soft plastic knobs.  She had completely chewed off all of the knobs within a week.  It was great for keeping her entertained but not worth the price 
 I purchased this book after seeing the 5-star reviews.  I was so disappointed after reading it that I checked the reviews again to make sure I'd purchased the correct book.  I shared it with ten of our holiday party guests to invite their feedback before giving it to my children in case I was somehow missing something indeed worthy of praise.  All agreed that this was a disturbing book for children that serves more to add to their existing ideas of what's scary, has no advice on dealing with these fears and offers nothing to promote their self-confidence.  After reading the book without realizing any of us were discussing it, my teen nephew even commented "wow, this is downer."  It's being returned.  There are far better books to purchase 
 I'd heard good things about this book.  This was a quick read.  I was irritated by the main character's low expectations in life.  When I was done with this book I was like, "what was the point of that?"  Enough said 
 This is a little too vanilla for me. It's sweet but it just doesn't seem to get my son to put his head down. I guess he may be used to more minor-key bluesy type stuff. I've spoiled him.  
 Not very bright for an LED.  AND, guess what? This is about 2 1/2 inches long if it is standing on its tippy-toes! Given the picture shows a spike on it, one could have the impression that it is big enough to spike into the ground and mark a trail or something... well, the spike is more like a thumbtack. I realize the images are provided by the manufacturer, so I don't blame Amazon - but there is NO excuse for not accurately listing the actual size of this. 
 The Sierras are much nicer when visited in person. Reading about the natural wonders found there isn't the same as actually checking them out for yourself. Perhaps if you were already familiar with the areas Mr. Muir traversed, and wish to brush up un them or revisit them literarily when unable to do so physically... THEN perhaps this book would be better 
 I usually like Deaver's stories, but I actually only made it through half of the book...then tossed the thing. I am not crazy about the subject matter when it involves children (even if they are at the teen stage). Should have paid more attention to the info at the back of the book. And I definitely don't need to have obscenities every sentence. My mother always stated that people who swore constantly had nothing of interest to say. I find this to be true, even in my choice of literature. My time on this earth is too short to waste reading this type of material.   So I am a prude...  Karen Sadle

 The customers and buyers that I deal with would throw me out the door if I  attempted these techniques.  Mr. Ley implies that by simply using certain  magic phrases, you are able to get a customer emotionally involved or upset  enough to buy from you.  I wish it were that easy 
 Why pay $34 when you can buy the magazine at a bookstore and order a subscription for $19.9 
 I'm sorry to say but I just couldn't get through this book. Read about half of it, but I'm not into long meandering descriptions. If you want a plot that will carry you along, this is not the book 
 Not intuitive, have to use the book to figure out how to set it. It worked for the weekly test fine for several months and then stopped working. Battery backup is misleading, the duracells we put in must have charged and leaked while it was plugged in and we had to reset the thing numerous times. For the price this is pathetic. This is going in the trash and I won't be buying another product from Oregon Scientific again 
 Normally I don't write books reviews but this book was so horrendous that I felt I needed to warn other Danielle Steel fans.  I have read all of Danielle Steels books and but this is one of the most poorly written books ever by anyone. The idea is good but the entire book needs to be rewritten by someone else. It seems the editor and publishing house didn't care what was inside the cover as long as it had Danielle Steel wrote on the front. I wonder if the editor even looked at this book?!?!?!  
 Baby Biorb was so cool looking and low-maintenance, I thought I would love it.  The problem:  The pump is noisy -- it makes more noise than than both the motor on my refrigerator or my dishwasher when it is running (despite the label on the pump that says it is "silent.")  Biorb's "customer service" was completely unhelpful -- both my calls and email went unreturned.  After several tries, I returned the Biorb.    
 This book was not what I expected.  It didn't give a good plan on the methods behind the it. It spoke in generalalities with no specifics. I would not suggest it, and didn't even finish it because it was so boring.  That's my 2 cents 
 I was looking for a book to guide me in postponing or avoiding hip replacement surgery.  The title "The Active Person's Guide to Taking Charge"  prompted me to buy this book, but I was disappointed in the book because so little of it was devoted to really taking charge of your physical situation so that you can strengthen your hip and achieve its maximum flexability.  A better choice for those wishing to do everything in their power to avoid or postone surgery would be Dr. Klapper's book, "Heal Your Hips", which is also available from Amazon.co 
 My wife purchased an HP Photosmart 8450 Printer as a Christmas present for me. I installed it and it worked perfectly for one week. Then the colors started to change. Photos had extreme amount of yellow in them, such as yellow faces and hands, no proper flesh tones.   I call HP support and was told that my printer was out of warranty because the warranty starts when the printer was manufactured, not the purchase date. I was offered one free call but my call was interrupted because of an appointment that I had. I was given a case number, but when I called HP back stating my case number, they said that this was no longer a free call. I explained it was an extension of the first call, but they refused to work with me.  I think HP warranty policy stinks, and would not purchase another HP product as long as this policy stands.  
 The adjustable slider combs are horrible and I found the Conair where you had several combs to choose from worked better for me.  I cannot get it to cut the hair on my husband who likes it very short, it would not even take any hair off.  All it did was waste money and electricity to charge the battery.  I thought this was the best brand out there, but Conair beats them by a mile. I think I will take it back and get a refund and go buy a Conair with the money.  
 This book reads a lot like an entry-level psychology textbook where you get a taste of what is about to come, but you never quite get there.  The author has gone to some great pain to provide you a psychological overview of what various signs and symbols mean in regard to Freemasonry.  Instead of taking the symbology at face value, as most people would do, the author has "read between the lines" and interpreted what is "really meant" by the working tools, and so forth, of the craft.  My impression is that much of the interpretation is a bit far fetched.  Case in point, the author states on page 31, "This collection of symbols, and particularly their proximity to the place in the Temple where Divinity is said to reside, indicates that a Master Mason, in the sense that we are defining him, is a person who is conscious at a psychological level which relates to the World of the Spirit in the same way that our ordinary ego is conscious of the body and the physical world."  Overall, this book is a rapid fire snapshot of many works of art regarding Masonry, but the emphasis is more-or-less on a pseudo-psychological impression that one man has attempted to define and apply to the craft.  The message throughout the book seems a bit juvenile for such a strong subject.  The text is well written though and has found a place on my bookshelf, if for no other reason than the pictures that accompany the text.  The photographs throughout the book make it worth buying if no other reason applies 
 This novel is neither a love story nor a story about Titanic. Don't be misled if that's why you want to read this story. What it is, is the tale of a 12 year old boy struggling with the confusing and conflicting feelings which the onset of puberty brings. Unfortunately, this is a poor choice of narrator for a tale of the tragic ship. Sumner Jordan, is so wrapped up in his own feelings and fantasy love story, the object of his affection is a 21 year-old suffragist, that he is neither observant about his surroundings, nor perceptive about the feelings of the famous and fictional characters he meets. Worse, he complains about everything. So much so that when he is going through his crises, instead of feeling sympathy, you just wish he'd deal with it and keep quiet. Sumner is also hard to believe as a 12 year-old boy. Especially at the beginning of the book, the voice is more that of a girl.  A major problem with the story is the lack of character development. You never get to know enough about any of the characters to really care about their fates. During the sinking, the life and death decisions are made so quickly, little suspense is generated. If you collect Titanic literature, by all means, add this to your collection. If you are looking for greater insight into the disaster, look somewhere else 
 If you want to read a Classic of Western Mythology, look no further.  This is specious philosophy under the guise of a supposed 'truth' about reality.  The tragedy of all this is noticing other reviewers' comments about how the contents of this book negatively influenced their lives.  Dawkins belief that we are machines created by our genes is a misleading view of reality, and when evolutionary 'science' catches up with evolutionary 'philosophy,' this view will come out false.  This could only be taken seriously by those who are so blinded by the details that they can no longer think straight, so they are not able to figure out where the argument is wrong, let alone realize something IS wrong with it.  What almost everyone doesn't seem to understand, even about VALID arguments is this: ALL a valid argument does is set up a tug of war between the premises being true and the conclusion being false.  If the conclusion is OUTRAGEOUS, you don't, "bite the bullet," "swallow the medicine," and accept the conclusion anyway.  You say there MUST be something wrong with the premises, even if you can't point out where the mistake is.  It took some 2,000 years before someone came up with a solution to why Zeno's argument that 'nothing moves' is incorrect.  But during that period of time, NO ONE (except maybe a few fools here and there- probably 'intellectuals' like this Dawkins character) accepted the conclusion that nothing moves 
 This is another Hollywood costume epic. They spared no expense with the set and costumes, hired talented big name actors Rex Harrison, Liz Taylor and Richard Burton. Despite the resources committed to this film sadly the film was more stylistic than substantive.   Harrison was terrific as Gaius Julius Caesar but he is only in the first half of the movie and Richard Burton does not come across as a great Mark Antony. His character is weak willed and he is harassed and henpecked by Cleopatra, Antony was passionate and reckless but henpecked?    Although the film is titled Cleopatra, it focuses more on the historic events.  The film also reduces Cleopatra to the woman depicted in Octavian's propaganda rather than portraying the real multi-dimensional woman who was intelligent, a gifted political strategist, expert linguist, dynamic personality and who ironically was not a beauty.  They don't give you sense of what was so compelling about Cleopatra.   She is depicted as a combative shrew with both Caesar and Antony. I doubt constant conflict would have gotten far with either man. If you took away her looks would either man have been attracted to the personality portrayed here?  I would think not especially considering both their backgrounds as Roman military leaders and the weak position of Egypt compared to Rome.  Given the limitations of their vision of Cleopatra Liz Taylor was perfect choice to cast as the selfish, beautiful, seductive and glamorous temptress; she really breathes life into this character and gives a great performance.   Although a portrayal of the real person would have been much more interesting you can't deny Taylor's appeal and she does a great job considering the limits of the material.  Although Taylor shines sadly we never get to know Cleopatra her depth managed to get lost in this oversexed Hollywood costume drama.   This movie was lush eye-candy without a whole lot of substance; in fairness to this project it fits in with similar epics of the 50's and sixties - the style reminds me of DeMille films like The Ten Commandments. It did capture the public imagination because it launched the relationship of Taylor and Burton and ultimately despite its issues and because of their star power it turned a profit.    The research, writing and the Directors vision should have each contributed to creating a great film instead it produced this mediocre costume drama.  The real shame is that in the hands of someone with a vision and a passion for the subject matter it could have been great. 
 This may be a good SD, don't know because the company would not allow shipment to Hawaii.  Therefore ordered the Viking SD and it has been a very good SD 
 The book has a very simple and clear way to describe what 3D design is about. It takes a simple project and teaches how to design it from scratch using basic design elements and explains how to develop it to a 3D animation film touching on cinematography and aesthetics(though very subtle and superficial).   It is a great source for beginners and people who are not familiar with design and 3D terminology and elements. However even somewhat little experienced designers involved in 3D or graphic design would see that they already know most of the stuff told in the book. It is like "3D & Design for Dummies" 
 This book does not explain the process of solving a caculus problem.  They give you a theorem, never show you how it is solved, and expect you to learn from it.  I would never recommend this to any of my students 
 A very nice read, with much feeling for the atmosphere of the period. However, Stephen Koch has written a book halfway between fiction and non-fiction, and it is too often unclear where fact ends and fantasy begins. In many cases historical facts are presented incorrect. This is especially problematic where negative qualifications of (at the time) living persons are given without a shade of proof. A small example, is his qualification of Joris Ivens's Dutch cameraman John Fernhout (in the USA known as filmmaker John Ferno) as a 'Comintern-apparatchik' (page 62). On the basis of the available archive material in the Netherlands and the USA there is no reason whatsoever to assume that Fernhout had anything to do with the Comintern. Never in any research about Dutch persons and their connections with the Comintern or Soviet-services did Fernhouts name turn up. He is mainly remembered as, well, Ivens's cameraman, and as the filmmaker in the household of Crownprinces Juliana of Holland during her exile in Canada in Woldwar II. In Stephen Kochs book, Fernhout is just one of many people who are called Comintern agents rather rashly.  The main matter I would like to adress is Stephen Kochs verdict on Dutch filmmaker Joris Ivens, who is one of the main characters in his book. The author says Ivens was a 'Comintern agent' and 'Comintern apparatchik'. It is fair to admit that Ivens's position was a lot more complicated than that of others. Stephen Koch writes himself that his judgement on Ivens is based on my book 'Living Dangerously. A Biography of Joris Ivens'. But I never used the term 'Comintern agent'.  There is no doubt about the fact that Ivens was a member of the Dutch communist party at the time, and that in the thirties he was in almost permanent contact about his filmwork with communist and Comintern organisations. Unfortunately Stephen Koch does not define what a Comintern agent is, but I would suggest that such an agent was at least 1) Not free to do what he liked. Defecting or disobedient agents were liquidated or called back to Moscow and never heard of again.  2) He would have some serious secret mission.  I have called Ivens a freelance communist. In my view he was one even as a partymember. He was completely loyal to party politics, but nevertheless remained largely independent at an organisational level. The relationship between Ivens and Comintern organisations was one of consultation between two parties rather than one of giving or receiving orders. An obvious exception was his work at Meshrabpom Studios in Moscow - a studio that was part of the Comintern apparatus - where he was an employee before he went to the United States.  As for the secrets, in Spain Ernest Hemingway was fully aware of the fact that Ivens was a card carrying communist. John Dos Passos knew that he was an unconditional admirer of the Soviet Union well before they departed for Europe (Ivens's views were apparent even from his public speeches in the USA). It was clear from the beginning that Joris Ivens would be the director of their film 'Spanish Earth' and would thus have a decisive say.   The secret mission from Moscow that Stephen Koch suggests is: Ivens came to destroy the literary avant-garde of which John Dos Passos was considered the main representative in the US. For this reason Ivens was supposed to stir up contradictions between Hemingway and Dos Passos. This theory is a red line through Stephen Kochs book, but in my view this is mere speculation and hardly realistic. Such a plot would have been contrary to communist policies of the time: every Western artist, modern or old-fashioned, was hailed by the communists as long as he or she sympathized with practical communist policy. In general I don't believe in, and see no proof for, the suggestion that Ivens's doings connected to Hemingway and Dos Passos were concocted on forehand since 1936 or even earlier.           
 Unfortunately, I purchased and read this book on steroids. Of all the books on the subject, this was by far the worst. The "sources" of information (if you can even call the people sources) are questionable at best. He invents information and passed it on as fact. He will take 1 out of 25 studies -- the negative one and cite that as proof of his point, while ignoring the other 24 favorable or neutral ones.   I disagree with the 1/2 of the reviewers in this topic, though some bring up good points. Mr. "Objective" Nugent is not one of them. He has a major axe to grind.  All in all, not worth it 
 As said by other reviewers, a lot of what was in the original story was changed, and the film was updated to the time period where it was. The boys are American, from a military school, and talk about fear of the Russians snatching them up and drafting them for their athletic teams. The choice of making them from a military school may have been a poor choice - it may have hurt the belief of the transition from normal boys to animals. I don't want to sound like I'm stereotyping people in the military, but people in general already think there's a thin line between military experience in matters of war and the feelings of a wild animal.  Basically, I think the biggest problem with this film is that the storytelling is lost. You don't feel like there's a transition to barbarism like you did in the book and the 1963 film. For example, during the bonfire sequence Jack is shouting out directions: "OK, you be the pig, we'll be the hunters," and everyone chases the selected kid around the fire. (not actually hurting him, mind you, just chasing him) That's not chaos nor barbarism, that's an organized celebration. It's about as uncivilized as a frathouse orientation. The director tries to play this scene out like it's a terrible thing, but it just doesn't come across that way.  I might also add that this shares a similar problem with another modern adaptation, that being the John Hurt "1984." That film, if I recall correctly, didn't have a single "Big Brother is Watching You." Likewise, this film doesn't have a single, "Kill the pig, spill her blood!" That's right, the most famous line from the book is not even in this movie. Actually, a kid in one scene says quietly, "We killed a pig." That's about it. This leaves out an important part in the transition of the children from civilization to animal-like behavior. The fact the boys relished in the killing of a wild animal, chanting and screaming, "KILL THE PIG! SLIT HER THROAT! SPILL HER BLOOD!" was one of the most poignant moments of the book and 1963 film, and is one of the most recognizable literary quotes next to "Tell me about the rabbits, George."  On a final note, the character of Piggy is ruined in this film. Danuel Pipoly was terrible in the role, and sounds like he was plucked from an elementary school play. I don't wanna give too much away, but I was happy when "something something" happened to him. That sounds mean but it's true, and it's a very bad thing in a film like this.  This film could have been good, but it fails on all levels. The transition from schoolboys to animalistic roots is unbelievable, making the whole point of the story lost on the audience. The best part of the whole thing to me was that marine at the end, and he's in about ten seconds of film time. I hate comparing it to the 1963 film version so much, but I would really suggest people see that instead. Avoid this unless you can catch it on cable and watch at your own discretion 
 I felt like this book never took off like most Grisham novels do.  It was predictable throughout the novel, and the ending was so abrupt- I felt like Grisham thought the novel was getting too long and going nowhere, so we'll just end it with a short chapter about what pans out with each character.  I do really enjoy a good Grisham novel, and have to admit that he is my favorite author- but I just didn't enjoy this one 
 This book is a complete waste of time for both the beginner and especially the non-beginner. The author spends a great deal of time trying to be funny and wastes the reader's time and energy. He should have spent more time giving content. He does not give even the beginner much concrete advice. I would strongly suggest you find another book; his book has very little value. There are better books for the beginner in networking

 The Covert-One series, written by a variety of authors, unfortunately does not live up to Ludlum's standards. Since Paris Option was my first of the series, it was bearable, but all other Covert-Ones are very similar to each other. If you've read any one book from this series, I would suggest you stay away from the rest.  The suspense is decent, but the climax is very predictable and it all works out somehow in the end, without a well-thought out approach to the finale. Covert-Ones start with a variety of events occuring simultaneously, events that in the beginning don't really seem to have a bearing on the other. In the middle of the book somewhere, it all comes together leading to a high-testoterone (but somewhat unbelievable) climax 
 The book was a page-turner I just wanted to turn the page. This book has a lot of excitement. No because I myself did kind of connect to main character he was just so cheerful. I learned that you could make the best of things. The genre is Fiction. The style of writings significant they use words like feminine. There was a good part with George singing a song about the new folks coming. The chapters did not end with cliffhangers. The story gets uninteresting at some parts, like how the animals talk about stuff. The plot was believable; it had a super good plot. I would recommend this book to people who like animals. It is a good funny book 
 Actually, since a couple of the Yuen brothers did the choreography for this movie, it isn't really ripped off.  Corey Yuen Kwai did the action for 'Buddha Assassinator' and there is some sleeping style in this movie also, but I will get to the action in a minute.    Stephen Chow plays the king of beggars.  Once a rich young man and great in kung fu, he gets cheated out of everything he should have had by a government official.  He is now forced to become a beggar with his father.    The main problem is that the movie just doesn't flow together very well.  There is just too much beggar talk.  The story doesn't move along at all except at the start and end.  The rest is just mindless talking.    This starts out like a kung fu movie, but when Chow becomes a beggar, that becomes the main focus of the story.  The action is very good when it does happen and I loved the sleeping style.  Sleeping style has been used in a few older movies and it was nice to finally see it in a newer one, but they could have used it more.  The undercranking is way too fast but the fights are still pretty good.    2.5/ 
 Jonny left edgy guitar slinging blues-rock quite a while back if you did not realize.  His current amalgamation is more of a hodgepodge than concert of styles for my taste.  I would have preferred a harder core gospel as Dylan did with 'Saved'.  Two stars only because as Gospel there is much better to be found.  If it was under the Contemporary Christian category I would go three stars. (He is still touring bars/clubs and not the church circuit yet though.) Probably no stars anymore for blues or rock. 
 This is a quick and easy book to read since the author only presents the very few facts that support his opinions. If you waste your money on this book, at least you won't waste much time 
 Simply put: the movie is boring.  Clichï¿½ upon clichï¿½ is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the "natural" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk "friend" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.  All in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause. It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie.   Save your money, save your time, choose another movie. 
 In his magnum opus, 1984, George Orwell famously wrote,  "Who controls the past, controls the future and who controls the present controls the past". This is a lesson that Jared Diamond has obviously learned well.  In his latest book "Collapse" Jared Diamond" continues to push the Europhobic liberal agenda. Hiding behind the facade of environmentalism Diamond crafts a sub-text that calls for Europeans to embrace the values of failed third-world cultures and abandon the pursuit of technological advancement that has created global European cultural hegemony. Unfortunately for Diamond, genuine scientific research is revealing much of his work to be based on nothing more than wishful thinking and an overactive imagination.  Diamond makes the assertion that Easter Island experienced a cultural collapse due to depletion of natural resources and overpopulation. This may conflate well with the tenets of liberalism but unfortunately for Mr Diamond, it does not conflate well with the factual findings of the latest archaeological investigations. Radiocarbon dating of soil samples, by Carl Lipo and Terry Hunt, indicate that Easter Island was not inhabited until two to eight hundred years after the occupation time that Diamond's theory would require. Quite simply, the new evidence uncovered by Lipo and Hunt indicates that the period of human habitation of Easter Island was far too short for Diamond's putative collapse to have been the result of overpopulation. To quote Carl Lipo,   "It fits our 21st century view of us as ecological monsters. There's no doubt that we do terrible things ecologically, but we're passing that on to the past, which may not have been actually the case, to stick our plight on to them is unfair"  It is difficult to over-emphasise just how badly compromised Diamond is by this evidence. The Easter Island chapter is a major plank in his argument, the fact that Diamond is rank ignorant of the latest archeological research reveals him to be an amateur polemicist rather than a scientific authority figure.  Those who may think that Diamond's Easter Island fantasy is simply an abberation might want to introduce some hard science into their analysis of Diamond's version of the history of Greenland. The extinction of Greenland's Viking colony is used by Diamond to enforce the ideology of modern liberalism. Diamond claims that the Vikings perished because a racist contempt for the Inuit prevented them from assimilating ideas that would have prevented their slow starvation. A cultural superiority complex caused the Viking colonists to cling to an unviable agricultural lifestyle and, in Diamonds words, "The Greenland colonists starved to death surrounded by oceans teeming with fish". This is an analysis that neatly dovetails with modern pro-immigrant, liberal cultural relativism and the dogma of multiculturalism. The major flaw in Diamond's argument is that the latest historical research shows that by the time of the colony's extinction the Greenland Vikings had, in point of fact, switched from a diet that was 80% farm food to a diet that was 80% marine food.  In otherwords, the Viking colonists proved to be perfectly capable of adapting to environmental change without having to learn lessons from stone age primitives. To present the Vikings as beloning to a soley agrarian culture in the first place would be the cause for much derisive laughter among genuine historians. The Vikings are well known (unless you are Diamond) to have exploited a rich variety of marine life as a food resource.   The alternative explanation for the Vikings demise is that the mini-ice age that caused the Vikings to switch diets also witnessed a mass immigration of Alaskan Inuit who competed with the Vikings for food and finally massacred them in an unrecorded genocide. We know about the mini ice-age from the evidence of core samples and tree rings. We know about the Innuit peregrinations through archeology and folk record. In the face of genuine science and history I'm afraid Mr Diamond is left up a certain creek without means of conveyance. Historians tend not to write about evolutionary biology, perhaps evolutionary biologists might in future restrain their urge to embarrass themselves by writing about history?  
 To say that Cavell's prose is challenging is charitable, at best.  True, his ideas are solid and any good, insightful work requires effort to understand, but Cavell seems to circle around himself in a rhetorical  spiral of namedropping and navel-gazing with an irksome regularity.  He  frequently explores ill-transitioned tangets with no warning or reason  apprent, and the overall read becomes fractured and one is left wondering  why.  This said, when one can extract the ore of Cavell's reason, it is  pure gold.  Truly, a mixed bag 
 I purchased this toy for my boys, 5,5,6.  We put the batteries in and tried to load the paper.  It's not cut right, so it doesn't fit into the paper holder.  Once we fought with that, we turned it on...it didn't spin.  There wasn't enough power to spin the wheel with paper.  What's worse is there were NO directions.  I took it back for a refund. 
 This review concerns the original 1932 edition and the revised edition published in the 1960's.  Both books follow the same plot; although, the revised edition is slightly different from the original.  While returning from a carnival, Nancy, George and Bess witness a large home suddenly burst into flames.  Thinking that there may be someone trapped inside, the girls rush to the house to help.  They are unable to enter the home because of the heat, but Nancy spots a man running away from the house and later finds a diary, written in Swedish, which contains numerous technical drawings.  Did the man start the fire?  Does the diary belong to him?  And what became of Felix Raybolt, the owner if the home, who apparently has gone missing?  Clues lead Nancy to suspect that the diary belongs to the husband of a poor woman that Nancy met at the carnival along with her little girl.  Nancy becomes determined to prove that Joe Swenson didn't start the fire, but all of the clues she uncovers seem to suggest that he is guilty.  Personally, I didn't find this book very good; there isn't much action, the mystery isn't very exciting and the book really lacks a true criminal.  Thankfully, the writing style used in the book is rather enjoyable, so it keeps the book from being a complete waste of time.  One thing to note about this book is that this is the volume where Nancy meets Ned Nickerson and oddly enough her first thought of him is that he is trying to steal her car!  This book is worth reading for the writing, but its not likely that many fans of Nancy Drew will find this book to be one of their favorites 
 I had heard of the importance, and significance of "The Education of Henry Adams" for a long time. I finally determined I needed to read it.  I acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first.   I am sorry  I missed the greatness of this book. I am sure there was something wrong with me, but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive.   Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not a likeable man. He was famous for holding court in his home near the White House, and making caustic and negative comments about every President who lived there.   Granted, he lived in Washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the White House. But the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like Adams depresses me. Why did anyone bother? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. The world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day.   He was a very good historian in his time. But who reads his books now? Not very many. In short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. Maybe the influence of some of the Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of Henry Adams.  "The Education of Henry Adams" does not have much real information. He got education in one place, none in others. Surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for Henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book.   When Eric Sevareid wrote "Not So Wild a Dream," it was compared to "The Education of Henry Adams." That was meant as a compliment. Oddly, I think Sevareid's book is much, much better. Sevareid wrote of America, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. Adams needed to get out more. He did not see America--not the America built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  I gained a trememdous amount from Sevareid. I cannot say the same for the work of Henry Adams.   Again, a lot of this might be me. Perhaps I read the book at a bad time. Maybe I needed to read it a third time. I do not know. I do know I do not think this is a great American classic. Forgive, please, my ignorance. 
 If you are going to buy one of his books, get "When to Sell". This one was long, wordy, and tough to read the whole thing - looking for content. Lots of fluff. Could have used a good editor 
 Will somebody please tell me where I can get the long version of Slow Ride - the entire reason I bought this album in the first place???!! 
 The cd is touted as unabridged but it isn't!!  These are short stories...Poe reworked them to make them leaner and ever shorter at the end of his life...and they found a way to cut him!!!  
 I sincerely expected much more from the author of "Guns, Germs and Steel" than this booklet that thrives on the trivia of evolutonary psychology. It's  obious why is sex fun- to encourage reproduction - and I expected the author went beyond this self-evident fact. Bit it didn't. And, excuse me, Dr. Diamond, how you account for gay sex in your reasoning? Homosexuality is totally  overlooked, yet it's one of the mayor puzzles of  human sexuality- and of sexuality in general. Dr. Diamond, I'm very disappointed 
 If you are preparing for the CISA,do not waste your money on this book. Put your money towards the ISACA's study materials. I found several errors as well as disagreements between this book and ISACA's study guide. 
 I am in my last year of school and preparing to embark on a career in banking. Out of all the finance and economics (I'm a double major) textbooks I have used this is the absolute worst bar none. While the text has a very large amount of information that same information is simply thrown at you with no real presentation.  One other thing that bothers me (possible the most) is the fact that I get severe headaches when I read this text. I have never read a book before with text this small. To me this says something since I am a voracious reader and frequently am reading 3-4 novels while also studying for my classes 
 How come they edited the first opening riff on Jet Airliner, I really like that alot. I dont know, I dont like this band and theres only 3 good songs. Take the Money and Run, Rock N Me, Jet Airliner, too bad they eddited that. Buy book of dreams and waste your amount of money on it and listen to the Jet Airliner on it, it's much better. The Joker is one of the worst songs I have ever heard in my lifetime. That's what makes this compilation sucks the price!! LISTEN to the Dire Straits insted.  "Telegraph Road" "Heavy Fuel" "Money for Nothing" "Skateaway" "Sultans of Swing" "So Far Away" "Walk of Life" "Industrial Disease" "Calling Elvis" "Romeo and Juliet" "Down to the Waterline" "Solid Rock" "Private Investigations" "Expresso Love" "Brothers in Arms"   
 I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read.  
 Roberts songwriting falls flat . We didn't find the songs as appropriate for children as many other children artists. Roberts songs are very bleak and not children friendly.  Stick with Wiggles or Ralph's World 
 This set of CDs is a fraud!  Nowhere does it say in the ads that it is not Chaucer that is being read but a "translation" by some hack poet.  So, if you are only interested in the stories but have no sensitivity to the sound and rhythm of the second best poet in the English language, then this is the stuff for you.  But it is definitely not Chaucer 
   I was hoping to be able to set up the LCC with this book, but apparently I needed to get the "How to Form an LLC" book (which I'm NOT going to do).    I've read the Nolo California Corporations book and it already covered much of the info here.  What I was looking for was help with writing good articles of organization and operating agreement (specifically for a 1-person LLC).   The operating agreement example he gives is not specific to a one-person firm.  A prudent person might change the language in his example operating agreement to reflect that the LLC is composed of just one person.  Also, the book does not cover the fact that in CA you can specify additional info in the Articles, such as rules for admitting new members.  Awfully light for "All you need to know" 
 esto es lo que me parece el cd de reyli y es un naco que se cree el muy chiapanieco deberia de retirarse y seguir planchando ajen 
 seriously, if you've read the joy luck club you've read them all. in case nobody noticed, her books are all the same. whoever said that the kitchen god's wife was a duller version of the joy luck club wasn't that far from the truth because it just WAS the joy luck club, only you've read it already so you knew what was coming. ie fights between mother and daughter. how profound/prosaic. really, read one of amy tan's books and you can talk about all of them with some kind of authority. 
 As a gay man, I could not possibly come to Terry Eagleton for help or advice. He is like the university professor who throws his hands up in the air and says: "I can't help you gay people become great critics and theorists; go see Judith Butler or Eve Sedgwick!" Eagleton is a white heterosexual male who has ONLY one thing going from him: class analysis. If he didn't have that, he wouldn't have anything. In fact, all he can talk about is class. Look very carefully in Eagleton's texts: gays, women, and minorities do not hold a very high place . . . if they are ever even mentioned at all. I suppose Eagleton would prefer they simply weren't there, clouding up reality. Eagleton must be a very troubled man: not only is he himself a bourgeois academic, Fredric Jameson is superior to him in every way and has said it all (in terms of Marxism), leaving Eagleton with only re-chewed polemics. 
 Despite its appealing title, cover, and organization, this book is nothing more than an Ayurvedic "Helpful Hints from Heloise." I was hoping for something with more depth, not tips (some so silly as "Keep a pitcher of herb tea or sparkling mineral water in the fridge") on how to cram more into an already hectic life. 
 an insufferable view of life among a claque of ruskie girlfriends from the late 50s to the late 70s. nothing more than "sex & the city" transplanted to moscow in the khruschev and brezhnev eras -- if thats your cup of borscht, more power to you 
 I love America, but this could be the worst Christmas CD I have ever heard! Do not waste your money. It is a joke. They try to work some of the guitar riffs from some of their classics into the songs, SHAMEFULL! Terrible, terrible, awful 
 Hwere we have a guilty concience trying to make himself feel better by justifying in helping a murder go free. The arguemnnts are weak and stupid and do nothing to refute the overwhelming blood evidence. What is more is that after the criminal trial so much additional evidence has been exposed that only proves even more how guilty this man is.  A few reviewers seem rather confused.  One reviewer suggested that mark fuhrman discovered both gloves. Not true! The glove at the bundy crime scene was in full view of numerous police officals before fhurman even showed up. Those gloves were a rare isotoner product of which only 240 extra lg were sold at one store in the united states. Bloomingdales in ny and credit card receipts prove that OJ owned 2 pair. I wonder how many other los angelas residents owned any of those 240 pairs of gloves sold 4 years ago in new york? Not many? Where would mark fhurman even get a pair of he wanted them and how in the hell did he know OJ's glove size?  Another reviewer suggested the crime was commited at 11:15 which is interesting because simpson's own defense team suggested the murders took place around 10:40. The discrepancy of time comes from when witnesses heard nicole's dark frantically barking. Witnesses saw nicoles dog barking nonstop with blood on her chest area at around 10:30-10:40. Where did the blood come from if ther murders have not been commited yet?   That same lame brained reviewer also said that OJ had nary a scratch on him. Really? What about the severe cut on his left middle finger that bled all over his property? In simpson's interview with police the next day he actually volunteers that he cut himself getting something out of his car. Cut himself at around the exact time the murders were commited? What a one in a million coincidence.  What about all of OJs blood at the crime scene? What about ron and nicole's blood in OJ's bronco? What about blood from all three on the rockingham property? Who was that running behind OJ's house bumping into the airconditioner at around 10:45 if it wasn't OJ frantically returning from the murders? Who was that 6 foot 200 lb black man the limo driver identified as walking into OJ's house at around 10:50?    Only idiots and the ignorant blind can honestly claim that OJ is innocent. If dershowitz needs to clean his concience he should talk to a rabbi.      .......socks  
 I don't know the process works for applying to other grad school programs, but if you're trying to get into a top tier b-school, this book has little to offer you 
 i purchased this item with the recommendation of a make-up sales representative at nordstrom's.  i was less than pleased with the product.  I used the entire container and saw no benefit!! 
 I just got this book and I'm very disappointed; even thought, I haven't prepared a thing. There is some picture but it doesn't reference the name of the food that's in the picture. How do I suppose to know the recipes of the food that's in the picture? For most of the pages, it doesn't have a picture of the food....it only recipes. I don't know how the food will be taste like or looks like? If there's a picture, you would say that's looks good but there's no picture. There are millions of recipes, do we suppose to know what's good or not; without providing a picture or sampling it? When a food looks good, people will try to prepare it. If you not a Thai, then you will be very disappointed because you'll not know what your food looks like when you try to prepare it 
 Seeing what's become of the rock and roll legends I remember from when we were much younger, I found very depressing. I'd rather remember them the way they were 40 yrs ago. Even Jerry Lee looked like he was ready for the nursing home 
 Our family bought this tank and we went through plenty of goldfish with it. We stopped buying when our 10 year old was using the scope to look at the fish. She was pulling it up and down and turning it and when she was finished, she put it down and saw that she had put it down on the actual fish. The fish was bleeding and died. The kids were not very happy. I guess this is an okay tank but not great. You might want to put only beta's in it. I would suggest getting something with a filter and heater if you want any other kind of fish 
 this is the type of cookie cutter crappy late eighties dreck that was played on a lot of radio stations at the time. although, cheesy as it is now, definitely takes you back to a time and place, abeit, a very cheesy time and place. anybody still growing their mullet!(sic! 
 As a rule, I like the Seche products.  This polish thinner did not work for me and was a true disappointment.  I wasted my money on this one 
 My overall recommendation is to read Bryson's brilliantly funny recent works, then go back to less recent works, then stop before you get to this one.  As other discerning reviewers have noted (especially Amer-Aussie, whose spot-on review you really must mark as 'helpful'), Bryson looks for the worst in America and, surprise, he finds it.  Sure, there's much that's funny here, but the humor gets swallowed up by the mean.  Let me add one more observation, which amazingly seems to have eluded all:  one of Bryson's worst habits--even worse than his penchant for telling you where he is politically (he hates Republicans)--is his smug disdain for and ridicule of religion, particularly Christianity.  Happily, Bryson's later books show a maturity absent in this one 
 I've always had issues with this product since I bought it on Amazon.  I've updated the firmwares for both the router and the card but the problems persist.  The problems are inconsistent internet connection.  Its easy to isolate since I can connect my workstation directly to the router/modem.  And when I do, my connection is normal  I've since travelled a lot and didn't have time to give this back ...   Be warned 
 Corbusier's theories, as much as anyone's, led directly to the dis-integration of the city in favor of the elements that we currently know as sprawl. And he specifically celebrated the things that today, we are trying to painfully wean ourselves from. For example, he exulted over the fact that "I will live 30 miles in one direction from the office, while my secretary will live 30 miles in the other direction from the office, and together, we will consume enough gasoline and rubber for tires that we will keep several people busy producing them." OK, so that's not an exact quote because it's been several years since I read the book, but that's the essence. Look it up, and others like it, and you'll discover that this guy's ideas are responsible for greater destruction of western urbanism than World War II. Seriously. Look at maps of cities in Europe before the war and after. Then look at them in 1970, after Corbusier's ideas came to fruition. You be the judge 
 My boyfriend pitched this as a hilarious must-see and now I cite that as an example of why I could not stand him and why we broke up.  My main problem was with the lightning-quick but utterly insipid dialogue. The headline sums up how I felt about that 
 This book gave me insight into German culture. It is no wonder  there was a Holocaust with children's books like these. Max and Moritz are adventurous children and they are caught. Being caught isn't enough. They are ground in a flour mill for punishment. Not even that suits the miller. he feeds their remains to the ducks. It instantly reminded me of concentration camp victims being cremated and then turned into soap. This story will forever give nightmares 
 This product is terrible. It's the only thing that I've ever returned to Amazon because it simply dosen't work.   I bought it because I bought a small pate terrine, and I was looking for something to grind small amounts of chicken livers, pork and so on. I was dubious -- it seemed to kind of cheesy. But I thought that as long as it basically worked, it was fine.  I put in some chicken breasts for a pate recipe, and those were fine. But the, I put in some pork. It squished up in the machine and couldn't come out. It got stuck and I had to remove the mincing plate. I tried the larger plate. The same thing happened. Essentially, any meat with even a small amount of fat can't be ground in this machine. It has only a small, not very sharp grinder blade element. Given that the meat you'd tend to grind would be for the likes of sausages, pates and for hamburger, it makes this machine useless. I actually had some hamburger in my fridge. Just for fun, I tried putting that through the machine. It also didn't work on that -- and it was ALREADY ground!!  I thought, OK, I'll try it for some pasta. Maybe that will redeem it enough to keep it. No way. The engineering on a playdoh machine is better. The dough comes out and immediately tangles with whatever comes out of it. It also just gets stuck and refuses to move through the machine. There's no way to make any kind of "strands" of pasta. I tried three separate pasta recipes. I am a culinary school graduate, and a professional cook -- i know how to make pasta. This machine just doesn't work. Then, I went to clean it up. It took 40 minutes, using a skewer and Q-tips to get the pasta out of the little holes.   The suction cup device that is supposed to hold it onto a counter works only temporarily. It seems sturdy, but then you start to crank and it comes right off. The sausage funnel is way too small to actually use for sausage.  It sort of works for nuts, but then, I can use a coffee grinder for that.   Take my advice -- get the right machine for the job. Get a cast iron meat grinder; they sell them on Amazon. Get a separate pasta machine, the stainless steel kind that breaks the pasta down into sheets of thickness. If you want to make baby food, get a good quality food mill.  I think this is the most disappointed I've been in a product in a long time -- and I didn't expect much! Stay away from this product 
 Nothing new or original. What we have here is a cd of already established, previously released, original version, but none the less good deep house music that is just simply mixed and cross faded together. If you are a new comer to House music than you will like this cd. For those who have a good collection of House, you will find that many of these songs are from some of your other cds. For exellent, funky, infectious, deep house, you should buy Nude Dimensions Naked music. Tracks 6 and 13 from this cd are on it. You'll love it 
 I was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. Unfortunately I think both are very much overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character. 
 Were it not for Eminem's diatribes of the hood and a handful of curious Detroiter's (former and current), I can't imagine what interest this book would hold for anyone.  I know the area Clemens speaks of and it is nothing short of amazing that he has so little to write about that is interesting.  I suspect that the author was an "academic-in-waiting" from his earliest years and that the sounds and heat of the street were a little too dangerous for his sensitive soul.  I will give him credit for being a decent writer, though.  Furthermore, claims by a number of reviewers that Mr. Clemens is racist are pure politically correct nonsense.  It is more likely the case that the author is guilty of being white and a bit naive 
 This book is poorly written.  Unless you know Non-profit accounting, it is not written so that you will learn anything.  I'm assuming professors use this book because of the Smithville case and for no other reason.  Honestly, I do not feel the Smithville case goes along with the book very well.  The authors should have exchanged notes a little more.  Unless it is required or you are already working in non-profit accounting, I would not buy this book 
 Was NOT impressed.  Not much to it either.....very short CD with only a few tracks 
 God what a turkey! But it was the 80's afterall 
 As the previous reviewer pointed out, this is NOT the KLIC-5001 1700 mAh battery as described in the Product Details, it is the lower capacity (1050 mAh) KLIC-5000.   At least it is the Kodak battery, if that matters to you. (I have a new Kodak camera and want to protect the warranty.)  If not, plenty of places sell the generic KLIC-5001 for less than Amazon sells the Kodak KLIC-5000 
 There is absolutely nothing special about this leave-in conditioner, besides the fact that it smells really good.  However, I didn't see any changes in my daughter's hair after using this conditioner.  NONE.  It is watered down so you must rub it in your hair very quickly. Otherwise, it will run down your face and neck (wish it came with a spray pump instead).  I was expecting some sort of difference since this product line is well-known and has a lot of star/ celebrity power behind it.  However, I found this conditioner to be all hype 
 Though too fluffy and light-weight, 'Chasing Papi' is not as awful as some opinions might suggest.  Produced by none other than 20th Century Fox, one of the major Hollywood studios, it has enough budget to create the colorful looks and joyful soundtracks.  Sadly, the film just doesn't know the right way to use three surprisingly refreshing Latina-American actresses, and that's the real problem.  Well, but I think the opening chapters are awfully bumpy.  Think about this.  Thomas is dating three women at the same time; a Chicago laywer wearing glasses, a street-smart Miani cocktail waitress, and a rich, sheltered, spoiled daughter in New York.  Normally, this kind of guy cheating women, well-meaning as he thinks he is, is called Romeo, and I suppose most women would despise him, but because this Romeo, or Thomas, is so irresistible, the three women  cannot stop thinking about the possibility that SHE is the only one meant for him.  I wanna ask whoever gave the green light to this project -- are you living in the 21st century?  But to be fair, that is only the introduction, and wait a while.  The real point of the film is the ad-hoc coalition to get over the embarrassing situation (like Thomas fainting and an FBI agent watching it!), which eventually develops to the friendship between them through joining in a beauty pagent or dacing on the stage.  The film uses up its tricks pretty early on, and funny moments come very sporadically.  In fact, the characters, stories, and gags are all too familiar today, and look exactly dead art, like pie-throwing.  With short running time of 80 minutes, the film still looks padded out, and I didn't talk about the 'dream' sequences (including that of a chihuahua) that have nothing to do with the story.  As I said, the three leading ladies Roselyn Sanchez, Sofia Vergara, and Jaci Velasquez do act with gusto, and they did admirable job for their characters always remain likeable.  And I like Roselyn Sanchez, who has curiously attractive charms like Sandra Bullock, and was the only good thing in terrible film 'Boat Trip.'  I just don't understand why Hollywood must keep on wasting them in this awful films again and again.  Innocuous, fluffy, but that's not the problem.  The problem is that they could think of only hackneyed ideas to fill the 80 minutes.  And they used as many as four writers.           
 Joel Beinin loathes Israel, and in this book, admits as much. He reports his ideological transformation on Kibbutz Lahav in 1970, his course from Labor Zionism to the "new left" at Hebrew University, from which he migrated to Trotskyite anti-Zionism and Maoism and concluded, "I was no longer a Zionist." An admitted Marxist, Beinin has for 30 years vigorously opposed "the Zionist project."   As a consequence, this book is not history. Rather, it accepts facts only for ideological use. No subject escapes unharmed. Like his prior books, this one attempts to advance Marxism while denigrating Jews, Judaism--and Israel.   Beinin claims that Israeli and Egyptian "political considerations" prevented Jewish refugees from telling their story. Yet he dismisses bona fide histories produced by refugees like Bat Ye'or and Yehoshafat Harkabi as gloomy "neo-lachrymose interpretation." They're accurate.   But Beinin counts these historians worthless because their work carries the "imprimatur of...Israel, the Zionist movement, world Jewry, and...normative Zionist interpretation"--and because they diminish Palestinian claims. By this flawed logic, only Arabs or anti-Zionists could report on 1 million Jewish refugees forced from their homes in Arab lands and the victims must remain in perpetual silence.   Not surprisingly, given his own bias, Beinin minimizes Egyptian anti-Semitism as well. He dismisses pervasive Egyptian media ridicule of Jewish leaders during the 1940s, 50s and 60s. It is not "an expression of primordial Arab or Muslim anti-Jewish sentiment."   Beinin likewise dismisses the waves of false arrests to which Egyptian Jews were subjected in the 1940s, 1950s and 60s. This was not anti-Semitism, either. He cites rabbinic denunciations of Zionism, made under duress, as "proof" that Egyptian Jews were not Zionists and claims that Jewish leaders "shamelessly exploited" and "grossly exaggerated" Egypt's "Nazi-like anti-Semitism."   But Egypt's government frequently published hateful tracts like Shawki Abdel Nasser's Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the Teachings of the Talmud. Moreover, former Nazis and SS officials  seamlessly joined Egypt's government, and had huge influence.  --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 If there were, Fogel would have a chance to add a second Prize to his earlier one for Economics.  Consider this book purporting to describe the wellsprings of social improvement in America, to the present -- and  focusing on its popular, rhetorical wellsprings -- with one index entry for  "Progressivism" and none beginning "Socialism,  "Workers," or "Communism." In fact, according to Fogel  social progress has come about due to technological change and church  preachers responding to it.  Mother Jones was just a mother (my  characterization, Fogel's vacuity).     That a Nobel Prize winner could  publish such tripe I think has dumbfounded almost everyone, so little  commented upon has this book been.  But if you put stock in others'  opinions and read history, take my word for it, this is an very poor  amateur history by a non-historian with a Nobel Prize. If you don't, and  have a brain in your head, buy it and weep 
 I was eager to read it but greatly disappointed; these unicorns act far too human for my tastes.  The mom, dad and prince live in a cave, the prince has his own little room where he goes to pout; I wanted to read something original and imaginative and more "realistic."  Kids may be more entertained but adults with a broader base of literary tastes will be bored and even put off. 
 I rank this book slightly higher than Season of the Machete, simply because I only got to page 25 of that book before giving up on it. I finished this book, but it was hardly an enjoyable read. The one positive is that the chapters are very short, so it feels like the novel moves along at a nice pace. The actual content, however, is very poor. This book is just surviving off the past Cross novels. If someone was just picking up this book having not read any of the prior Cross novels, they are just not going to understand or care about the subplots involving Cross's estranged son, his other two kids, this new love life, etc. I've read all the books leading up to this book, and I barely cared or understood what was going on.   Compare this to Kiss The Girls or Jack and Jill, and it comes up way short. The story and the plot are very thin and very disjointed. Nothing about this book keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you will only feel compelled to finish it if you are a completist. This was by far the worst of the Cross books. 
 Makes many accurate observations about boy behavior and its origins,however,the book leans a little too much toward "feminization" of boys in preventing behavioral problems.This may be the politically-correct way to help boys,but not the productive way or the ethical way 
 After having read some of Nancy Kress's short fiction as well as Beggars in Spain and Probability Moon, I was expecting substantially more from this novel than I found.  What made Probability Moon an interesting read was the unique alien culture it depicted.  The characters may have been two dimensional and her interpretation of modern physics jumbled, but the anthropology of a society in which all ideas and opinions are arrived at by a biologically imperative consensus made up for that.    In Probability Sun we see little of the World culture and more garbled science and scientists.  The characterization of the scientists is gratingly two-dimensional.  Capelo is one of the most unsympathetic characters I have come across in a good while.  In fact, all of the characters appear so narrow and crudely drawn that it is hard to sympathize with their opinions or outlooks because they seem so bizarre and unsupported.  The science itself consists of garbled explanations of modern physics.  Kress freely spews quantum mechanics buzz words almost totally divorced from any actual understanding of the ideas.  The science presented here reads more like name-dropping, she uses the right words but one is highly skeptical as to whether or not she really knows what they mean or would even recognize them in a crowd.  I read this book because I was interested in learning what would happen to the inhabitants of World when the humans returned to meddle further in their culture.  Unfortunately, this sequel is overall so garbled and thin that even finding out the answers to questions left over from Probability Moon couldn't make it worth the read 
 I loved these so much at first so cute and had great sound. They seemed to act as earplugs to the world outside and I loved that they didn't fall out like other earbuds. However after a month of use the right ear stopped working and no one would take them back very frustrating. Make sure to buy these from the dealer so that they will take them back with the lifetime guarantee. 
 The religion of peace is at it again!  In response to the popes words, muslims all over the world respond with violence, destruction, rage, hatred, burning down buildings, burning papal effigies, issuing fatwas against the pope, and even shooting a 70 year old nun in the back.  Wow, such peace from a religion of "peace".  If Islam is a religion of peace, then all the guns in the world are pink flowers, and every nuclear bomb, a soft feathery pillow.  Violence for words.  Destruction for speech.  PLEASE!  This is a religion of war, and bereft mindless 70 year old bags like Noam have begun to lose a lot of mental function with age.  This old bag of a man gives Muslims free passes and blames America.    Question:  When will the world start holding to account the actions of Muslims, and stop blaming others, such as Bush, America, the Pope, or God knows who else? How many more innocent people will die at the hand of Muslims before the western world finally, and for the first time, holds the Muslims accountable for their own actions, rather than someone else?      Well Im sick of the left defending this vile cesspool of Islamofacism.  Im tired of the leftist media beating up on Israel and coming to the side of middle-eastern tyrants who shoot 70 year old nuns in the back in response to spoken words.  And then these radical leftists have the audacity blame the pope!  Can you believe it?!!  Yes, idiots all over the western world actually blame the pope for the mindless violence and destruction that followed from a spoken word.  Its unreal!  A grown man got a gun, deliberately aimed it at a 70 year old woman's backside, and deliberately pulled the trigger, purposefully killing her in cold blood....and yet according to socialist America-hating leftists, he couldn't help it.  Its not his fault...its the Pope's fault guys!    Respond to words with violence, and then blame the speaker, absolving the person who actually commits the violence of responsibility.  As absurd as that sounds, I'm sad to say there are actually people all over the world who think that.  And they are idiots (like Noam) 
 This book is bad, it is annoying that a company that has published so many excellent books in the past would stoop so low. This book is essentially a compendium of information that is presented in a much better fashion in the free MSDN magazine or in more depth in Worx's (good) books such as their C# and ASP+ book (which I recommend). I suppose if Fawcette published it as a special issue of VBPJ I wouldn't have been so annoyed but as a book this simply doesn't work and is a waste of your money 
 Honestly, nothing about this show grabs me. I'm surprised this show gets such high Nielsen ratings every week. The writers tend to come up with similar stories all the time. But the biggest flaw is the acting. It is really laughable. Me and my friends watch this sometimes to laugh at how ridiculous everyone seems to be. Horatio Caine talks in a slow drawl all the time, saying the stupidest and most obvious things. Calleigh is always smiling at everyone and everything up to the point it gets irritating. None of the C.S.I team displays any emotion whatsoever, oh...except Horatio when he over does it.   The stories are also terribly boring and utterly predictable. If there's a V.I.P suspect with a "history" with Horatio, yup...you guessed it, he's involved (either directly or indirectly). And also, if the suspect appears in about 10 minutes into the show...yea, it's not him. And Calleigh gets "evidence" such as DNA from saliva etc almost every episode using her sexuality. I mean, once or twice is alright...but I've seen about 8-10 episodes and she does it all the time. Every criminal here is an idiot, they are sure to leave all kinds of huge "clues" leading to them or their alliances. And every crime gets solved all the time. Oh, and is it just me or does the C.S.I team seem to know everything under the sun at their fingertips, no need for books or researching, they already have it that big brain of theirs. Think that's unlikely? Exactly my point.  In short, I wouldn't move appointments or hurry home to watch this show. In fact, even if someone gives me this DVD set as a gift, I would probably keep it aside or maybe present it to someoene else. Watch this show if you're REALLY bored, with nothing else to do and no better use of your time. If you want real Crime Scene Investigation, watch the original C.S.I, Las Vegas. That's the best C.S.I....period 
 I LOVE Christian Chic Lit, & I even adored the prequel to this book, "The Whitney Chronicles", but Million Dollar Dilemma, was just ridiculous.  I felt the plot was very contrived, and there was not a lot of character development.  The pacing seemed off, and the storyline was just too bizarre.  Now, sometimes it's fun to indulge in fantasy-reading, but as a reader, I sure couldn't "just go along" with it.....  I love books that enrich my devotional life, but the scripture spouting seemed very forced, like the author said, "Well, think I'll throw a scripture reference on this page."  I really did not connect at all to this character, Cassia.  She was very flat, unseemingly naive, weak & had no personality.  In fairness to Ms. Baer -I KNOW she is a good author, as mentioned above with her "Whitney Chronicles".  I have heard from friends that other novels that she has written are equally as good.  This was just not up to par.  I recommend reading the Yada Yada Prayer Group Series 
 Don't get me wrong, I'm all for music that is a departure from mainstream junk. Crispy Ambulance employs basic chords and driving beats that have the potential for being good songs but they just dont have the ability to pull it off. The most obvious downside is the horrible vocals. Let's be serious folks, if you're out of key 90% of the time, your music is going to sound like crap. This is one garage band that should have stayed in the garage 
 Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is all the rage now. Unfortunately, most of the hype is for high-frequency RFID, i.e. 915 MHz and above. High-freq RFID systems are incredibly complicated, and are difficult to set up and get into good working condition, mostly because high-freq RFID is HIGHLY susceptible to electromagnetic interference, plus interference from water, liquids, metal, etc. People also need to be familiar with LOW-FREQUENCY RFID, which I'll get to in a moment.  While Wal-Mart and the DoD are leading the push to integrate high-freq RFID into everyday supply-chain systems, many of the systems simply don't work; again, because of the limitations I discussed above.  RFID for Dummies is a decent primer for HIGH-FREQ RFID, not low-freq RFID (125-134 KHz frequencies in the U.S.). In fact, the book only mentions low-freq RFID a couple of times. There's a tried-and-true system for low-freq that's been around for more than 15 years, while this high-freq RFID stuff has been struggling like a lost babe in the jungle.  This book, again, is not for low-freq RFID, which is now used to track and ID animals, humans, medical devices, weapons, sensitive items, automobiles, gas cylinders, trees, etc. The high reliability of low-freq is unquestionable.   More about this book: the physics section is weak, at best. The author obviously wasn't a physics or electrical engineering major in college or grad school. Too bad, because many people out there could use a good lesson in HOW RFID works. Some good diagrams and figures woulda done the trick here. I've talked with dozens of people who are now implementing RFID in their work, and ALL of them commented that they would love to see a simple set of figures and diagrams that illustrate how the technology works.   So, if you're interested in a book about HIGH-FREQUENCY RFID, and you don't need a lesson in the physics of RFID, then I would recommend you read this book at the library.   Unfortunately, there are NO really good general books about RFID out there. You're better off reading white papers found on various RFID web sites.  WARNING: THIS BOOK DOES NOT DISCUSS LOW-FREQUENCY RFID. IT IS ABOUT HIGH-FREQUENCY RFID ONLY 
 These authors clearly have an axe to grind. What is sad is the disservice that is done through the spreading of such wrong headed advice 
 Tons of statistical data supporting the concept of low cost index funds.  I am invested in the Vanguard S&P 500 Index as well as other index funds, but this is a bit too much.  If you understand the concept of indexing, save some cash and skip this book 
 I thought I was going to get a thriller when I first heard of this.  Instead I got a pseudo-sequel to COLD MOUNTAIN set in 1980 Texas, and I have rather low opinions of COLD MOUNTAIN.  It was difficult to follow the story due to McCarthy's decision to not only avoid using quotation marks to identify dialogue (a move I've always considered to be a pretentious affectation), but also commas, apostrophes, and proper spelling, such as not capitalizing "English" or using "livingroom" instead of "living room" and "mam" instead of "ma'am."  I don't know if this is something McCarthy does in all his books or this was a one-time deal, but it was a major turnoff and made the experience grueling rather than enjoyable.  I also didn't see the relevance of the italicized monologues of Sheriff Bell at the beginning of each chapter/section, as he tended to ramble on about life after  World War Two and how it wasn't uncommon to see 22-year-olds as ordained ministers or 25-year-olds as sheriffs of counties the size of Delaware.  Hopefully its movie adaptation (which I legitimately pity the Coen Brothers for having to wade through) is more accessible 
 The 1-star rating is for the Madacy print - the movie rates 4 stars. As a general rule avoid anything by Madacy, they market some of the worst prints imaginable of movies in the public domain. This one is no different. It is dull, dirty and virtually unwatchable. If you want to see the Scarlet Pimpernal then wait for the TCM movie channel to broadcast their beautiful print from time-to-time 
 This book started off slow and I read about 1/3 of the book until I was interested in the story at all.  While the writing is very descriptive, the author does not engage the reader by  developing empathy for the characters.  Not recommended 
 Poorly organized, verbose writing style and most of all lacking in basic communications skills.  I'm not sure how an editor let this thing get published.  It contained virtually nothing I found useful and ranks as the worst golf instruction book I've ever read 
 Charles Fort had intelligence, yes. But where do his theories stand now? For instance, his thoughts on the "raining frogs and fish" occurance goes like this: he denied the scientific theory that they were sucked up in a waterspout and made his own: that all lifeforms were created in a giant sargasso sea in the sky and occasionally intelligent aliens dropped them to Earth. He generalizes the entire scientific community in simple strokes, physicists, your doctor, astronomers, chemists, yes, he claims to debunk them all. Is evolution true to Fort? Nope, all life is created in the sargasso sea in the sky: Genesistrine, and is teleported or dropped by aliens to Earth. Crackpot lit 101: Charles Fort 
 This is a seriously flawed book loaded with stupid and/or clichéd characters.  Susan is truly one of the stupidest characters I've read in a long time.  I have a hard time liking a character who would not punish her daughter for getting drunk, sleep with her soon-to-be ex (after finding him in bed with another women) and smoke pot with a guy she hardly knows (who eventually manipulates her into bed while managing to get her into the Victoria's Secret corset and thong he just "happened" to buy for her!?!)  I read one review that found this scene funny.  To me, it was sad and pathetic.  I found some chapters that did not flow right at all.  One moment, characters are in one place and then all of a sudden in another place with absolutely no explanation as to how.  This book definitely needed a better editor.  And, isn't it convenient that Susan decides she wants to write for the newspaper and, lo and behold, don't they just happen to want to hire her.  I could go on and on, but do not want to waste time, unlike this book, which is a complete waste of time. 
 How does an 8 page article become a 127 page book?  By the most annoying padding ever attempted in a single book.    The author wanted to sell a book, but had no material.  He never talked to Tiger or Haney.  He used photos from a driving range.  What does he do to fill the pages?  Mention how many majors Tiger has won-at least every chapter.  Tell the reader he was once an editor at Golf Magazine- 15 times.  Plug every book on golf he's ever written. Write a chapter on the grip.  Say it is important- quote everyone who said the grip is important.  Talk about Hogan.  Tell about his book.  Mention Nicklaus.  Never write 6 words when 80 will do.  Here is an example- He doesn't write "Tiger won the 2005 British Open."  Instead he wrote, (this is an actual quote!): "On Sunday, July 17, 2005, Tiger Woods raised his already great game to an even higher level to win the coveted claret jug that is given to the winner of what Americans call the British Open and golf aficianados overseas refer to as the Open Championship. On that beautiful Scottish evening at St. Andrews, the home of golf, Tiger was also crowned the 'champion golfer of the year' as he was given the gold medal presented to all champions."    There is more, but I don't want you to throw up 
 I enjoyed Covey's 7-habits work, and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books. This is one of the most heavy handed, preachy books that I have encoutered. Give me a break! After vomiting, I threw it out. Save your money and try these instead:  Leadership Challenge 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership Good to Great First Break all the Rules 
 I bought 8 size D's for my boom box thinking it would be the answer to having to buy batteries every few camping trips.  Wrong answer.  I was able to play 2 1/2 CDs before my box was out of juice.  Game over.  I realize these batteries lose their charge quickly by sitting around, but these batteries were fresh off the charger when I left.  I figured they'd at least last into the night, but they were finished before sundown.  Don't believe anyone who says these are for high drain devices...  I got fooled.  Fool me once, shame on you.  We can't get fooled again 
 A confused film with stereotypes and a self-deceiving message that confounds statutory rape with a mid-life spiritual awakening. Check out the fantastic Aussie film from 1987, BLISS, (directed by Ray Lawrence) and you will see how AB is a weak, mixed-up reworking (from a writer who cut his teeth in TV sitcoms). The very last scene of AB is the true tip-off to the reality of the rip-off, compare the camera's heavenwards pullback and Spacey's final voiceover monologue. The lovely poetry of BLISS' last scene will, if you have even a vague pulse, bring real soul-tears to your eyes. You tell me.   PS -   I was moved at the final images of Annette Benning's wailing in the closet and her brief, gleeful smile on the Tilt-a-Whirl (black and white film is so underrated). So, there's a couple of stars for that 
 The first several books were great, but about half way through, it just turned into porn. I have never minded a little sex in books, but this one is nothing but sex. There's supposed to be a big important vampire meeting/party after the ballet, but Hamilton doesn't even bother to write it, having Anita passed out from too much sex and magic. I lost count of the new people introduced in this book so that Anita could have sex with them. and not just sex, but multiple partner, kinky sex with an audience. This book finally crossed the line where I can't stand it anymore and will be selling the entire series as soon as I go back to selling books.  Anita has collected a harem of who know how many men that only have sex with her, and do whatever she tells them to.   She has created a triumvirate of her, Nathaniel and Damien, but she doesn't take care of them and Damien is forever on the edge of dying because Anita doesn't have enough sex to keep him alive, even though she needs a waiting room and a take-a-number machine for the people she is having sex with.  The preview of the next book features Edward, who's been missing for a long time with a personality transplant. As I read the preview, I just could not see this new Edward. I'm not about to read a new book and see Edward as a different person. Stick a fork in her she's done.   This book should not be sold to minors. The review should come with a warning. I gave it one star, because they won't let you not give it any 
 I guess the price Gilbert paid for 'total' access was 'total' Churchillian myth building.  Glosses over ANYTHING negative--refusing to even acknowledge the subject's alcoholism.  A giant of a man, no doubt, but all men have faults and it is not a good biography that glosses over them 
 I don't know what type of Italian/American family other people grew up in, but I grew up in a loving family with wonderful warm traditions, holidays filled with love, humor and great food, songs sung in Italian, stories of the old country and a door that was always open with the coffee on the stove...I found none of that nostalgia here.  What I did find was the stereotypical pictures, sayings and gestures that unfortunately television portrays Italian/Americans to be.  If you are looking for a book that not only will translate swears from Italian, but will show you pictures of the gestures as well, or teaches you the correct Italian response to someone farting, this one is for you 
 Read this book first, and then read "For your own good:  Hidden Cruelty in Child-Rearing and the Roots of Violence" by Alice Miller.  In it she describes what happens when you follow the advice described in "The Strong-Willed Child".  She describes the child-rearing methods in place in Germany at the turn of the last century.    The similarities of those methods with the ones described in this book (focus on absolute obedience by use of force) are chilling.  I know from my German background the fruits of child-rearing methods that use violent methods to ensure obedience to authority.  Especially when coupled with an available scape-goated minority already disliked by a majority of the population.  Yes, pain and humiliation will create a child submissive to your authority in the here and now.  But do you want that for your child, or for your society?    And most importantly, for the Christian parent, get a red-letter Bible and read the words of Jesus.  Read Matthew chapters 5 - 7.  
 This unit is heavy and awkward. Three months after I purchased it, the on-off switch stopped working.  Sanyo's nearest service location is more than one hour from where I live.  I called their customer service center and they refused to show any flexibility regarding service (ie, they would not pay for me to ship it to a repair center, nor would they authorize repairs at a nearby appliance repair center).  The customer service representative was unsympathetic and refused to offer to allow me to speak with her supervisor. Avoid purchase of Sanyo vacuum cleaners to avoid similar problems 
 I'll probably never run out of music to discover. It seems that no matter how many stones I turn, no matter how exhaustive my search is, there will always be atleast a few gems I'd somehow overlooked. For me, XTC are one of those gems. I picked up Black Sea at the local record shop and it completely knocked me out. Maybe it was those huge drums, or the way everything felt like it was pulling apart at the seams. Regardless of what it was, I had to have more. Over the course of the next few weeks I proceeded to buy Drums and Wire followed by English settlement. Again, both were completely stellar albums, especially D & W.  Then there was Skylarking. It was supposed to be THE XTC album, their masterpiece. People compared it to the likes of Pet sounds and proclaimed it one of the best albums of all time. I'm sad to say it didn't live up to the hype for me. In fact, I find it to be downright mediocre. For me this is where they dropped the ball and failed to pick it back up. I'll admit that I miss the more raw, punk like energy that was found in early XTC, but that's not why I dislike this album. I actually enjoy alot of mellow, lavishly produced music, but Skylarking just sounds...bland. None of the songs seem to stand out and the production is borderline soft rock. Every time I listen I hear less of what made me love XTC in the first place and more of why I can't stand Phil Colins. Even the songwriting itself is weak, lacking strong hooks and any sort of weight to help the music rise out of the syrupy muck that Todd Rundgren laid out. I just don't see what all the fuss is about. 
 This was such a waste of money and my time reading it. First, Ms. Frank cannot write very well. Secondly, it is information that is recycled from other sources of self-help books. Her website is geared toward selling more useless information. If you have to read it get it from the Library. It should be titled, "How I can Get Rich By Selling Useless Information to Dreamers Like You. 
 I was ready to like this book. I wanted to like this book. I'm interested in this particular era and the author has a fine reputation for the historical novel. So I began reading with great anticipation - only to discover deep disappointment. I haven't read his other works but he really strikes out with this one.  The idea is an interesting one - intertwine the story of Marconi, the inventor of wireless telegraphy with a famous murder case in which the wireless figures prominently.  The problem is the author seems to have lost all his understanding of dramtic writing - character development (there is none), tension (there is none, we know the outcome before the book starts), Plot (plodding), Pacing (the author gives away the wireless tie-in during the first chapter, so there is no mystery at all - no dramatic announcements by the keen and stalwart detective at the last moment to surprise and delight the reader).  These historic, naturally dramatic events are presented as if we were reading a dreadfully boring history book. And there is no dialogue at all! We only hear from the characters when the author dryly quotes from their letters. Rather then letting the characters speak for themselves and tell their own story, the author lectures us on all that happens. Historically more accurate perhaps but it makes for dull and dreary reading.  The murderer, Dr. Hawley Crippen, is so shockingly inept that one wonders  how the man was able to tie his own shoes. He is so stupid that he can not devise of a simple cover story to explain his wife's disappearance (like she ran off with another man, for example) He allows his girl friend to wear his wife's easily identifiable jewelry and furs - right in his own office! Does he imagine no one will notice? He even sends his flunky out to buy several suits of boy's clothing - all but telegraphing his intent to flee with his girlfriend disguised as a boy.  When its not being a dry-as-dust history book, this tome is like reading a stuffy newspaper article in the Times of London. A nasty twit killed his wife and was caught (yawn).  I gave the book two stars rather then one because at least the parts about Marconi and his struggles to perfect and commercialize his invention are somewhat interesting.  I would recommend it only if you are waiting in the dentist's office and there was absolutely nothing else to read (and you found it sitting there).   In summary: a depressingly dull and boring book. Don't waste your hard earned money on this one 
 Clearly John Gardner is a literary genius, however not being one myself I found that his style was a little overbearing, it does not offer the inspired start to writing fiction that I was looking for.   
 I read all of the reviews before I purchased this and knew that batteries might be an issue, so when my collar didn't work properly, I bought new batteries hoping that was the problem.  The collar never worked below a setting of 5, and rarely worked above that setting.  When it did work, it was inconsistent in its power.  Additionally, its range was less than 15 feet--not much help when your dog is racing around the backyard or throughout the house in a barking frenzy.  This is a product that needs to be consistent if it is to be helpful 
 Some eroticism, more of a soft-core porn movie but unlike most of those there is the plot.  The problem is perhaps that some of that plot gets lost in the translation, and there is much about Sada that goes unsaid and you are left to guess. The movie wasn't overly graphic in terms of sex, in my opinion, but the non-sexual images and some of the story was quite freakish.  Not worthy of the class people are putting it in on many of their 'most erotic movies' lists...  or maybe it's just not a very good movie. Was looking for an artistic, erotic masterpiece...this was about as erotic as a clockwork orange, but nowhere that good.  Some of the reviews here would have been more helpful--we wish we had read them, but I admit I didn't want to spoil the plot completely.  
 hm.  i found it to be rather amazing that this book was even published.  IT IS SO BAD.  the dialogue is saddening and the story is only slightly better.  stay away, otherwise you will be regretting the waste of valuable time 
 I also purchased this product & was extremely disappointed when I found out it did NOT work.  Like the 1st reviewer wrote, it basically is a mini-fan that moves BUT it does NOT cool the car down at all!  There was absolutely NO difference in the temperature of my car after I installed it!  DON'T waste your money 
 Have to agree with the reviewer from Melbourne on this one. Herzog says in the introduction that he eschews any overarching methodology, laudable in theory I suppose but not very good in practice. The result is a rather  meandering narrative that lacks the benefit of a clear central argument to  structure it. Probably the main strength of the book is that it draws on a  staggeringly broad set of texts. [To be fair, I have not read the entire  book, so you can take my criticisms with a grain of salt I suppose, though  I do think I have grasped the essentials of his text. 
 Don't waste your time on this, it's nothing but a glorified comic boo 
 This book contains many beautiful pictures and if you are a stay-at-home world traveller you will definitely enjoy it.   On the other hand, I found the politically correct preaching to be tiresome. People who buy these books are not generally interested in the author's opinions on politics and it would have been better to have left it out 
 This book is written well enough that one might overlook the numerous flaws in Mr. Siegel's case.  This case, while sometimes compelling, is far too often flawed.  Simplistic logic seems to be Mr. Siegel's forte - that  is, he takes things as cause and effect without offering proof of any  assocation.  He argues, for instance, that Cuomo's building of prisons  lowered the crime rate and Reagan's deregulation led to economic growth.   Proof behind either statement is lacking, as it is throughout this book.   For a history, this was also majorly flawed in that it did not identify  sources - where does Mr. Siegel get the few statistics he puts in the book?   Demonizing conservatives and liberals also seems to be Mr. Siegel's strong  suit, as this avoids the need to offer a comprehensive ideology of his own.   I did learn more about all three cities from this book but cannot be sure  how much is definitively true due to the large amounts of spin.  Worth  reading, but do so critically 
 I thought there was something depressingly familiar in the hyperintellectualized way Edmund Morris tells the story of Ronald Reagan in "Dutch," but it took a while to figure out. Then I did. It was the hurt tone of a rejected suitor who just discovered the object of his desire views him as just another face in the crowd.  Morris's defensively recondite grandiosity makes William F. Buckley read like Mickey Spillane. "All his life, Ronald Reagan has ridden a long road dissolving, at the limit of sight, into something scintillant yet ethereal. His vagueness about that vision is the typical mythopoesis of fools or mystics." Elsewhere, he throws up the odd French phrase or compares some state of the union address to a Bach fugue or Schiller verse.  I guess we can blame Nancy Reagan. After he was recruited to write her husband's authorized biography, Morris recalls the First Lady putting the brakes on needed cooperation, citing her concern Morris might take material to be featured in their memoirs. One can understand Morris' discomfort, given that Nancy seems a handful, likely to resent whatever Morris wrote if it included mention of Ronnie's first wife or the fact he did some things during his presidency some people found fault with.  Morris evidently decided if he was going to upset Nancy anyway, he might as well do it with a bang. Hence, "Dutch" throws up a number of items designed to make the First Lady howl, including a fictional doppleganger who shadows Reagan and talks about Dutch's career path with his catty, disapproving friends. Morris' semi-fictional narrator snips away at Reagan with faint praise: "He finds it almost impossible to dislike people, although I grant you that's because he's not interested in anyone as an individual."  "Dutch" is no slamfest. Much of its account of Reagan's presidency is quite positive, even when discussing his darker moments. A 1985 trip to a German cemetery where Nazis were buried, for example, earned Reagan much criticism at the time, though Morris sees it as an example of Reagan's grit and determination culminating at one of his great speeches at the Bergen-Belsen extermination camp site. Morris insists Reagan was a leader of active if often unengaged intellect, not just early on but throughout his presidency.  His calling the Soviet Union "the evil empire," Morris writes, was "the most vilified presidential utterance in modern times, the truest and most...seminal! Those two words, which translate so unmistakably into Russian (imperiya zla), convinced [Soviet premier] Yuri Andropov more than any number of bombs that the United States was morally ready to fight the century's ultimate war."  Though the Cold War was not the century's ultimate war, Morris makes clear its victory was Reagan's. It's just too bad the guy Morris describes here is such an inanimate clod. As a celebrated biographer of that dynamo Teddy Roosevelt, Morris must have wondered how he got stuck with such an unimposing subject. Finding out Reagan was as unimpressed with him was salt on the wound.  Morris offers a glimpse of that, catching sight of his subject after an Oval Office interview: "Something about his intent stillness suggested that he had already forgotten who I was, if indeed he ever knew."  Sniff. Alas, I can identify. Getting dumped is drag enough without anyone ever asking me to write 800 pages about the dumper. It's just a shame that Morris's bitterness spills over in what could have been a great book. Instead, "Dutch" is a mess, a memorial to the legacy of one of our most enigmatic leaders more frustrating than enlightening 
 Ughh! I was so frustrated with the main character of March in this book that it made it hard to enjoy anything else about it. She was whiny and selfish and abandons all those who truly care about her. It was impossible to have any patience or sympathy for such weak character. You wanted to tell her to grow up and start putting her daughter's needs before her own. Instead, she puts her daughter's life at risk by moving her in with a sociopath. The daughter, Gwen, was very interesting and you felt so sorry for her for having such a terrible mother. I also enjoyed her "love interest", her cousin that lives with Hollis, as well as her relationship with the horse. For me, these were the only redeemable parts of the book 
 This was a book I stopped reading when I was one-third of the way into it.  It's not because I think Great Britain is a boring place to read about (quite the opposite), it's because Theroux's writing is filled with so much sneering contempt for the places he visits and the people he encounters.  With a greatly inflated sense of his own intelligence, he snorts at everyone's little foibles and stupidities and sniffs disdainfully at every little town or vista he passes.  It's like being stuck in the car with a conceited sourpuss for a REALLY long road trip...  not worth it 
 I was intrigued by the concept of a detective mystery set in Tang Dynasty China.  Unfortunately the author hasn't mastered the essentials of writing a really good novel.  The characters didn't feel believable, the dialogue is stiff and unnatural, and the plot is slow-moving and contrived 
 I bought this book so I'd have something interesting to read during my son's tonsillectomy last fall.  I was hoping to enjoy the torrid love scenes in it!  I got half-way through the book, and it bothered me so much (my own issues getting in the way?), I put the book away.  I felt Anna was emotionally neglecting her daughter, Molly, while involved in her lustful dysfunctional relationship with Leo.  I didn't like any of the main characters, including Molly---all too unrealistic.  But I picked up the book yesterday and finished it.  The book was too flat!  Though I don't think she was a BAD mom, she certainly exercised poor judgment (and for what?  Like Leo was a good catch?)!  I wasted my time (I don't read books very often) on this story.  Yet I did read the whole book, hoping it would get better, so I'm giving it 2 stars.  I didn't think I'd get any more of Sue Miller's books, but other reviewers said she has better novels 
 But I won't because I paid good money for it.  As you can see from the other reviews, the speed on this thing is pathetic, almost to the point of non-functional when it comes to many small files.  I had a small game on the drive, but it has tons of small files in the folder. It took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder... makes you wonder if SanDisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing. Stay away.. or if you really want one, buy mine please 
 Being motherless affects so much of who I am; I realized this through Edelman's previous book, "Motherless Daughters". I laughed and cried my way through the pages of that book, so I was intrigued by the publication of "Motherless Mothers".   While very informative in many aspects (she begins to deal with the specifics of mothering from pregnancy all the way through grandparenting and so on...), I found many of her statements to be too broad of a stroke to cover the ever so intimate and personal experience of the loss of one's mother: ultimately, there are too many variables in one's life to truly come up with an effective statistic, so many of the ones presented, also, so bleak.  Much like with "Motherless Daughters", I loved Edelman's personal stories (written with SO MUCH LOVE) as well as those of the women she interviewed in "Motherless Mothers". In a sense, reading this book was like revisiting a friend after several years and finding she had grown up, matured and had healed what seemed to be open wounds last time I read her.  Still, would I recommend this book? Not over her previous one, no. There are many parenting books I have found more effective in helping me understand who I am as a parent (as well as improving my parenting skills, a nice consequence of understanding who you are) 
 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS has been promoted as a "gripping legal thriller" but I didn't find it particularly gripping or thrilling.   I ultimately found this novel to be a rather slow-moving experience.  The main character, middle-aged lawyer Michael Seeley, is not particular likable or well developed.  Despite his enormous financial success, Seeley spends a lot of time in this novel pitying himself and engaging in a variety of self-destructive and unprofessional behavior.   I found him a tough character to root for.  The plot moves slowly and mainly consists of a series of dialogues between Seeley and a host of supporting characters.  Much of this dialogue is stilted and ponderous.  This is the type of book where characters give speeches instead of having real-life conversations.  Some of the subject matter of this novel is interesting, but it is not served well by the dialogue.  I also found the storyline of this novel to be remarkably convoluted and largely rooted in the past.  I was hoping for a more realistic and topical plot, given Goldstein's background as a prominent copyright and IP attorney.  That didn't happen here.    In short, I found this book rather disappointing.  It's a decently written novel that explores some interesting issues, but the plot and characterization falls short.  I also found the ending rather limp and unsatisfying.  For a debut legal thriller that's much better than this one, I would recommend John Hart's KING OF LIES.  
 Peter Bain's an intelligent man but not a great teacher. I suggest that he needs to have an editor that is a teacher because he is all over the place in this book.   Although he is best known for his Forex course (which I think is good) this book is mainly about the stock market and futures.  I think this book has about two good chapters with limited information for my money 
 I am Zintkala Nuni, aka Lost Bird. I was given this name by my family in ceremony 1999. I was born and raised on the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in North Central South Dakota. I have records to prove my name and my relationship to The Lost Bird of Wounded Knee. Renee never interviewed my family for her book. And from what my family has found out, all of the information about Lost Bird's mother in the book is untrue. I'm sorry for writing this BUT the truth must be known and I WILL be writing a book about my grandmother, Lost Bird, in the future to counteract the fiction that appears in this story. I hope someone reports this to Renee. I would love to speak with her and I'm sure my family would want to do the same. 
 I have used the product for 2 months, and it just hasn't worked. My problem is just as bad as it was before I started using it. I am glad it works for others, but I just can't give it more than one star. 
 Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist .The author is a anthropologist in real life and I feel she gave to much detail as to body parts & conditions ,& locations in the book , and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about "Gabby " including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of Gabbys place & How Gabby and Tempe were friends from GRad to man parts in life . Book was not for me I dropped it at the 3rd chapter . 
 I am a long time beer brewer, who suddenly decided to switch to cider. This book starts with planting trees. I didnt want to wait that long. I wanted recipes! The section on yeast was a real disapointment, it listed one yeast not to use. Elsewhere I have read of the debate over English Ale yeasts or Champagne yeasts. This was the info I wanted. If you have NEVER brewed this is your book. If you have ever brewed and want to make a batch skip this one, get Paul Correnty's "Art of Cidermaking". Yes its out of print and runs nearly $50.00, but its worth it 
 I had to read this book for a class at University of Milwaukee-Wisconsin, and I will never, ever recommend this... to anyone.  Is he really trying to reach people?  Or just other PhD peoples?  Gimme a break 
 After having seen this movie, I understand why Europeans, Arabs and everybody else hates Americans... There are scenes where we hoped the servants would either poison the two annoying guys from Kansas or just flat out shoot them in a hunting accident and make them disappear.  The story idea is great, but the acting and script is so poor and unworthy of being described in a review.  Jesse must either have personal ties to the building where he filmed-or really fallen in love with the building. Everytime the story could have taken off we get a stop with yet another look at the building itself.  It's a miracle to us, how anybody on here could call this movie funny or entertaining - the movie is bad, pretending it to be a satyre doesn't make it any better 
 I bought the book due to its high variety of cocktiel mutation pictures.  As for a lot of the information - I agree that it is outdated and therefore may cause a problem.  My avian vet agrees and has given me the heads up on what is best for my little guy.  So far she has not been wrong and he has become a strong and beautiful bird since being seen by her.  The best advice I can give any bird owner is to ALWAYS take your bird to an "Avian Vet" and believe their expertise over any book!  Books are helpful but not always correct.  The reason I mention an "Avian Vet" is because they specialize in birds.  You wouldn't go to a foot doctor if you had a cold, so why would you take your bird to a cat/dog vet?  There really is a difference and it shows in how they handle and understand your bird.  They are sometimes hard to find, but worth looking for.  Good luck and happy bird owning!  : 
 Dr. Dean Ornish is a quack, plain and simple. He is on the advisory board of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which is just a front for PETA. Do an exact phrase google of "The Dietary Delusions of Dean Ornish" to get the skinny on this fool.  If you want to save your life don't waste your time on this book. 
 I am a fan of Ron Rash's fiction too.  I did not think that this book was as good as the first two.  The characters were not as compelling, the language not as lyrical, and the plot not as exciting.  There were too many loose ends--Travis's future college plans, reconcilation with his family, etc.  The whole book moved slowly 
 I retuned my copy two days after it arrived. The similarity between this book and the other is uncanny. That the other book  was published years before this one leads me to believe that Mr. Alburger has plagarized extensively from the original. The other book contains pretty much the exact same information - word for word. Whole chapters are virtually identical. Admittedly, James Alburger adds a few ideas of his own but they are not worth the price. There are at least 5 better books on VO than this 
 	Linda Lawrence Hunt must have had a time machine.  She chronicles Helga and Clara Estby's 1896 walk from Washington State to New York City in her 336 page book Bold Spirit.  She did so, even though all were unavailable to her.  Helga Estby, a Norwegian immigrant, keep many detailed journals during and after her journey, but her family burned them out of spite and shame.  Helga Estby walked across America to receive $10,000.  She planned to use it to pay off the debts she and her husband Ole and their ten children had accumulated.  Or so says Linda Lawrence Hunt.   	Bold Spirit is ten percent fact and ninety percent speculation.  Gleaning from only a few newspaper articles, public records, and a few interviews, Hunt manages to produce a considerably long piece of what she calls non-fiction.  For all we know, Estby planned to use the money to open up an opium den.  Just because the Estby's were struggling financially and Helga was offered $10,000 doesn't mean she planned to use the money to pay off debts.  Sometimes people do things that don't make sense.   	Hunt's "primary sources" are questionable.  Biased and inaccurate press is as much of an American tradition as hot dogs and beer, and it was especially rampant in Victorian America, as literacy rates and newspaper production rates were increasing but rules about unbiased media hadn't been established.  While periodicals help supplement a biographical account, they should not be the foundation of it.  Because time makes memories fade, interviews of family and friends are just as inaccurate. 	Hunt assumes the political views of Estby and her daughter.  She assumes that Helga was a feminist.  Had Helga been as strong of a woman as Hunt portrays, perhaps she would have written a book about her walk, like she had planned.  Perhaps she wouldn't have taken her nineteen-year-old daughter with her on the 3,500-mile walk.  Perhaps she would have opened up a school or started speaking to the community about her walk.  Estby becomes incredibly apathetic after the walk; perhaps she was depressed because of the death of two of her children while she was away.  Perhaps because she and Ole were never able to fix their relationship after she was away for so long.  Perhaps it was because she was raped or hurt on the trip.  No one knows, not even Linda Lawrence Hunt.  This kind of speculative "non-fiction" should not become a precedent in the historical world. 	This book would have been enjoyable if it were historical fiction.  Hunt could have used her imagination as much as she wanted to do pretty much what she did in Bold Spirit: fill in the gaps left by the documents.  She could have spruced up the story and added plot twists.  Her writing style is insultingly simplistic. 	I would recommend this book to a fifth grader.  The writing style is easy enough to understand.  The plot is basic.  On the surface, it is an encouraging tale about a bold, courageous woman.  But anyone interested in historical integrity, an interesting story, or reading anything past a fourth grade reading level should probably stay far far away from Bold Spirit 
 I picked up this book hoping it would live up to its title, but what I found was that it was rather boring and lacking in character development. The ending seemed rushed and many of the issues raised were left unresolved. I was disappointed. 
 This book is a scam.  Artist have to pay a steep price to get in this book, one that has very limited distribution and nobody of note will ever read.  They do the same with books of poetry, preying on the intense desire of artists to get their work out there.  Save your money.  Just look at the first few pages and you will see they have no design ability, thinking that more and brighter means artsy 
 If you know anything about wicca and pagan practice, some of these spells are dangerous and not something you should be using.  yes, it has a disclamer in the start...but why print them if they are not to be used.  I leave with you the wiccan law "And HARM YE NONE, do ye what will".  It's a known and important part of our practice that we do not harm.  Many believe that what you do will come back on you, threefold.  so just be careful. 
 I thought this book was very well researched, however, I was disappointed to see that 30 pages are notes and bibliography in a book that is 310 pages in length.  This book could also use another good edit for several 'snags' that I encountered.  Otherwise it is a good read 
 Definitely not the worst "How to SK8" book I've seen but not  that great either 
 My original order was 1 pair of tennis shoes missing so when I had to re-order the 2nd pair of identical tennis shoes, I was overcharged & also had to pay shipping fees again. I tried several times to resolve this problem via Amazon & the shipping co. Bealls Florida, but was basically ignored & never received my refund. I find this to be deceitful & poor customer service 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 This is an easy read... But you have to hash through a lot of common knowledge about the Bulls to get any interesting tidbits about Jackson.  Sacred Hoops gives you much more perspective into Jackson than this book does.  The author teases the reader with an opening story about how Jackson smokes two cigarettes and drinks a beer before he talked to the Bulls after a game... A great bit of informaion, but many true Bulls fans could have picked this up the the local papers or sports talk shows...  The author gets most of his inside information from Tex Schram, Johnny Bach, and Skip Schaefer.   The majority of the book is a general chronicle of the Bulls 8 year 6 title run offering few insights on Jackson.  If you followed the Bulls, read Sacred Hoops, the only 'fresh' information comes from the last two chapters about Jackson's year off and some information about Jackson's first year with the Lakers.  It reads quick, but do not expect learn any new in depth information about Jackson 
 I thought the subject matter of the book was timely, important and accurate.  I enjoyed the thoroughness of the analysis and comparisons of leaderless versus typical organizations.  However, that's where the book really ends.  There's no real actionable data for leaders to take back to their companies, only the argument of what they are up against.  I would love to read a Part 2 to this book that completes the cycle.  That is, how modern companies can utilize these patterns to their advantage to grow in the market place.  I think there are extremely valid applications of this.  One example that stands out is Salesforce and AppExchange.    By developing Apex and adding a marketplace (AppExchange) for third party development, Salesforce is expanding its footprint and innovating through organizations they may never have previously had a relationship with 
 This adventure of Cheech & Chong see's them playing a couple of dudes who work for some Arab dudes who like want them to drive a car from Detroit to Las Vegas but they have no idea why, they just wanna get paid for the job. Theres a lot of things happening to them as the drive from one place to the other.   There isnt much of the Stoner Humor in this one compared to other C&C movies. The laughs arnt there as strong as the other either, but the humour is still defintly there. I have a feeling Richard "Cheech" Marin probably wanted to show he could act as something other then the Cheech charactor, they play a couple of Arabs in the movie aswell, and lean more towards a humor not so pot headed. I think Cheech was trying to establish himself as a real actor. But least he stayed true to Cheech tho, he didnt kill the charactor or anything.  I'd say this is the weakest of all the C&C movies. I even think Get Out Of My Room is funnier then this... but dont count it out tho, it's still got some great bits in it.... my fav is when Cheech needs to go to the bathroom and ends up going a way he didnt expect.  There's no bonus features or anything which is a bummer. Seems the only one to get any attention has been the first movie... if there not going to give these things extra features, then they should have at least made the DVD a double feature with Nice Dreams (Columbian release's, thats why that particuler title)  We need a new Cheech & Chong movie, this may be the weakest, but it's still better then most of the stoner movies being made these days, thats why we need Tommy and Richard to make a new one to show the kids today how it's done 
 We read this book for our book club, and the overall feeling was that it was a quick, easy read, but very predictable and a little over the top.  We all agreed that we wouldn't be passing this book on to friends to read as we did not enjoy it that much 
 It is necessary to correct the current trend of public commentary, which tends, systematically, not to understand events in the former Yugoslavia but to construct a propagandistic version of Balkan rivalries, designed to validate the existing post-modern myths and prejudices. This book faithfully reflects the post-modern blinkers that its author has helped first create and then perpetuate in his "coverage" of the Wars of Yugoslav Succession. This book reflects his (and their) belief that the Orthodox nations of Southeast Europe - embodied in "the Serbs" - are The Other vis-a-vis "The West" in the Huntingtonian sense. The author's assumptions are prejudiced in a coarse, primordial manner.   Judah's mindset helps us understand why the problem of the Balkans under UN/EU/NATO/UNMIK/KFOR/SFOR. . . is inseparable from the quandary of America under the bipartisan regime inside the Beltway, or that of Europe "united" under the Leviathan of Brussels. This book unintentionally poses many questions, and answers none. Can any meaningful unity of nations sharing European heritage be restored? To what extent, how, and why has the modern, secular, "post-Christian" West inherited the antipathy of West to the carriers of the Byzantine tradition? How do those two traditions converge, and how do they diverge, amidst the continuing onslaught of globalized secularism? Such issues are not merely political. They are as much "cultural" as theological, and they have been political all along. It is on the way we deal with them today that the future of our civilization will depend, and it that endeavor Judah has decided to side with the bad guys.  A book is badly needed to counter Judah's prejudice and ignorance about an area of the Old Continent which need never be the "powder keg of Europe." Though the Balkans, however delineated, contain many states and even more nations, they have one thing in common: for most of history they have not been masters of their own fate, but objects of policy by dominant outside powers. Though depicted by Judah as aggressing against their neighbors and generating wider conflicts, the Serbs in most cases had these conflicts foisted upon them by powerful outsiders and their local minions.  In particular Judah's attempt to relativize the Ustasha genocide of some 500-700,000 Serbs is scandalous. Had the same apparatus of quasi-historical whitewash been applied to the victims of Treblinka, such book surely would not have seen the light of day - and rightly so.  Even if all history-as a philosopher argued-is in some measure contemporary history, it need not be dominated by the obsessions of the day. The cause of tolerance in a troubled region can never be advanced by misrepresentation or by the sentimental lapse of seriousness which judges one patriotism as admirable and condemns another as inadmissible. This book is found wanting on all fronts 
 I bought four of these and returned them immediately. Two were dead out of the box. A third had horrible sound.  After searching the internet and reading a variety of reviews for similar products I finally settled on the 900 Megahertz Wireless Intercom from Radio Shack. (43-3102)  Beautiful sound. Well made and about half the price of the Reporter. Pretty much the same featues but it only claims a range of 300 feet as opposed to 1000 feet. So if you need more than 300 feet for range it's something to consider. Better warranty than the Reporter as well and for 8 bucks you can extend that warrarnty for another year.  Anyway I couldn't be happier with the RS intercom. I just can't recommend the Reporters given that 3 out of 4 units that arrived were faulty 
 It is a wonder why I needed another 480P version of this movie.  When you purchase 'blueray' you may think at least 780P but not with this one.  I guess I should have been more careful but with all the hype I assumed the movie would be in a higher def 
 I'm a fan of Koontz but this book was a disappointment. First of all it seems that not much happens. Molly, the main character, goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing. It's too cutesy with children and dogs (Koontz, please, the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired). For most of the book it would be a 3 star book, but the ending is too cheesy and religious. What will he write next? A "Left Behind" book 
 First, despite what the socialist apologists tell you, Walter Rodney almost certainly was killed by a bomb he was holding in his lap while plotting to bust some co-conspirators out of prison.  Only afterwards did his fellow socialist party members concoct a story about exploding walkie-talkies.  Come on.  It exploded in his lap for goodness sake.  Mark Hoffman tried that defense and it didn't get him anywhere either.  Second, championing the cause of the poor, which Rodney admittedly did, is not the same as actually helping them, or even more important for HEUA, being a perceptive scholar.  Rodney's book is riddled with distortions, fallacies and unsubstantiated premises.  One glaring example.  Rodney pays practically zero attention to Mediterranean Africa.  For him, only sub-Saharan Africa is the "real" Africa.  Why?  Because his natural ethnic affinity for the area.  Nothing wrong with that, but then again, you shouldn't title your book "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa" but rather "How Europe Underdeveloped Sub-Saharan Africa." Rodney has engaged in thinly veiled racial rage and socialist dogma to rail against a bogeyman, a straw man, or almost anything other than the truth: Africa's problems arise from its residents, not from outside forces.  And spouting Marxist dogma isn't going to change that fact.  It was known 25 years ago; it's known a fortiori now 
 The pretentious photo of the author in a flowing ballgown on the back cover should have been the first warning.  I've never read a Danielle Steel before and I won't be speeding to the nearest Barnes & Noble to get another one.  Other reviewers have commented on the annoying amount of repetition;  I picked up on that before reading the reviews.  There have also been suggestions that Steel needs an editor.  For gawd's sake, she writes for one of the biggest publishers in the world!  They must have hundreds of editors but perhaps, just perhaps, they are intimidated by the prolific Ms. Steel.  Then there are some worldclass gaps in credibility.  Nobody could be as eccentric as Stanley and run a powerful (and megarich) conglomerate. There's no way a house as large as The House (in the center of San Francisco, no less) could ever be bought and restored for $750,000.  The oh-so-happy ending is as predictable as the setting's weather.  Ms. Steel has made a lot of money from her readers.  They deserve better than this 
 I went into my first listening session of Amputecture looking forward to TMV's crazy way of writing their progressive/jam/indie style, with a healthy dose of Spanish influence.  What I got instead was a band that went into one song with a vague idea of what was going on, and just played until someone got sick of it.  At least, that's what I hear.  Yes, as a musician, playing until you drop feels good.  It's a direct, uncompromising expression, and it's powerful for the artist... but in this case, completely incomprehensible for the listener.  I listen to a lot of progressive and "noisy" acts like Porcupine Tree, UneXpect, Ion Dissonance, Ephel Duath, and while all of them go off on tangents and explore new sonic territory, none of them leave orbit quite like The Mars Volta, which is something that Omar doesn't quite get.  Just because it feels like a sonic money shot to you doesn't mean anyone else is going to like it.  And that's where we come to.  Essentially, this entire album was based around a dozen or so riffs and the rest of it feels improvised.  If that's what you're looking for, than go for it, but it doesn't break any new sonic territory like people here are saying:  This kind of thing happens in every  bands practice room near the end of their jam sessions, every day, all over the world.  There is no definable style, no ideas to be had, and nobody can take anything from this.  The songs are impossible to reproduce live, and often TMV's shows are boring since they'll play a song and not stop playing it until someone gets sick of it, so you'll get maybe 4 songs a set.  I call Amputecture "Progressive for Dummies" because it is.  Progressive music takes a lot of time and skill to pull off correctly, and it's something that combines ideas, or plays old ideas differently, or just plays everything in a new way.  The Mars Volta do none of this, and simply just bang away randomly at their instruments and put it to tape.  It's pretty much a sham, top to bottom, and you might as well go listen to your friends garage band try to throw together a cover song, get tired of that, and just go off on a little improv jam session.  Repugnant album.  These shysters make money off of people and put no effort in to it whatsoever 
 If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS 
 Oedipus was a weird book to reab, because the plot was all twisted. The characters in the book are nasty. Oedipus kills his father and has two kids with his mother.... 
 I came to this after reading "The Pact," which had its problems too (occasionally cardboard characters/unbelievable situations) but was quite readable overall and kept me awake too late at least one night! This, while the idea was good enough, was a real disappointment. Having Rebecca tell it backwards took away all the suspense, so I was kind of like, who cares? Plus, we didn't really get a sense that Hadley and Rebecca had such a wonderful romance. "show, not tell," is the basic principle of fiction (and non-fiction) writing, yet all of this was just based on Rebecca telling us what a romance it was -- we didn't actually see it. Also, the different voices -- while not a bad idea -- Weren't handled well here. The best way of using different voices is to give you truly new insights into a situation, not to just repeat the same scene twice or even three times. As someone struggling with fiction writing myself, I may be too sensitive, but it seemed that this book should have been structured differently, and perhaps edited more comprehensively, to be truly effective. Jodi has certainly gone on to bigger and better things, which is good to know, but don't start with this one if you want to read her stuff 
 Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the "hero" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being?  And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack).  Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms.  Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves "ironic", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism.   Is this film an accurate portrayal of them?  Yes, in some ways.  Is the film worth watching?  Yeah, at least once.  Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth.  This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays. Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film.    
 I've purchased other products from Interactive Health, including the iJoy (which is AMAZING compared to other massage chairs I've tried), and their Ottoman 2.0 (which hits the spot on the calves wonderfully).   I bought this in hopes to get the same quality and effect as I have from their other products, but have been disappointed. The two massaging handles on either side of the pillow massage the sides of my neck well, but doesn't hit the back of my neck at all--and that's where my sore spot always tends to be at! The "pillow" itself is hard and can be uncomfortable, so you have to position your head carefully in order to really relax.   I wouldn't recommend purchasing this massager at its expensive price. However, should you find this massager on sale, it's a decent product. I'm still in the pursuit of a more effective neck massager, though.. 
 The book starts off where Black Notice left off.  Although I have read Black Notice, that was a few months ago, so I found the book confusing and lacking in necessary detail.  And I think that writing the book in first person present was a huge mistake.  While we see through the characters eyes, the view is bland and colorless.  I did not feel that there was any connection with the character, but that she was trying a writing exercise in communicating what you physically see 
 I found this book to be offensive.  On page 2, the author acknowledges the language differences of the process (toilet training vs. toilet learning).  As a reader, I understood her position and was comfortable to progress onto further pages.  As I continued reading, I was content with the author's writing until I accessed Chapter 4, where she discusses the positions of experts and references some of their works.  On page 47, she references the controversial book of "Toilet Training in Less Than a Day," by Nathan Azrin, Ph.D. and Richard Foxx, Ph.D. and that their "program was devised not for speed, but to help the retarded learn this difficult skill."  I think the term "mentally challenged" or "developmentally challenged" would have been more appropriate.  In spite of my shock that someone would write a book and refer to those with special needs as "retarded", I continued on until I accessed Chapter 6, "How Can I Train My Child Under Special Circumstances?"  Under the section "Using Public Restrooms Alone", the author discusses what she considers "supervised" use of facilities.  She states that a parent can stand outside the door while the child uses the facilities alone.  She states that a parent can "ask an appropriate-looking man to take the boy into the restroom while you wait outside the door. (Same for situations with girls, Dad.)" and to "only let a child alone to one that is in shouting distance or in view."  In a world where pedophiles are lurking in such areas and seize those moments when a child is alone to harm them, I find that advice to be completely irresponsible.  At that point, I could no longer continue reading this book and take advice from someone who would make such irresponsible suggestions.  I would rather have my child in diapers for the rest of her life!  Over 275,000 copies sold -- I wonder how many of those were returned, as mine was 
 I bought this book so that i can get more ideas and choices in my daily dishes.  i've read many great feed back from here and therefore i went ahead and bought the book.  I was really excited when the book arrived, but as soon as i open the cover, all my excitement quickly disappeared.   There are several problemswith this book.  first one is the pictures.   Perhaps, this book might be one of the earlier edituion publish by wei Chaun publishing company, therefore the photo doesn't show the detail process in how to hand the ingredients.  I noticed that other books that were published in the late80s and early 90's have pictures that are much more useful becuase it shows how things should look at each step.  This book only have pictures of the finished product.    Second problem is their rescipes.   half of the book involved simple stir fry stuff.  beef with onion and Sa te souce, beef with mix snow peas,  beef  with veggie in oyster souce.  i guess this is what home cooking is all about.  you make one dish. the next one you can add a different veggetable and call it a new recipes.  the souces are all the same.. (corn starch, soy, sugar and water).  with a tiny bit of cooking experience and interest, anyone can come up with those stuff.  the same goes with the stir-fry chicken and pork dishes.  it volved the same style just different meat.   I know that in chinese home cooking, most of the time you used the same source, brown soy thickened with cornstarched, either that or black bean or oyster ource which you can buy in a jar from a chinese store.  I am not crazy about the veggetarian their soups dishes in this book.  The dishes are too traditional.  it involved ingredients that are loved by older people like my grandmother.  younger generation  don't usually endore these dishes.    Other reipes i found useless are the appetizers (ham, chinse BBQ pork, beef shanks, and chinse sausage, sliced hard boil eggs and roasted peanuts, cashews).   first of all , the cold cut meats and nuts. can be purchased.   99% of chinese people don't eat these except when dine in restaurant.  most meats are something  buy from stores.    Finally, i should mention that i am chinese. i have chinese home cooking all my life.  I also travel to HK and Taiwan quite frequently, so i am very familiar  with many different dishes and various cooking styles.  I consider myself as a rather experienced cook.  I can make just about everything i've can tast.  I am dissappointed that this book only have one type of cooking style, that is basic stir-frying.  I know most of the stuff in the book already.  the recipes are the very basic home cooking recipes.  there's no new ideas.    I've  tried several recipes from the book, and the result was a very dissappointing.  and I am not impress with this book.  It is rather difficult to make recommendation for this book.  on one hand, this book contains many simply stir fry recipes useful for those who are not familiar with chinese cooking.  However, you do need have cooking experience to be successful.  you need to understand chinese ingredients in order to follow these recipes.  If you're chinese  you probably already know how to stir fry most of the stuffs from the book, and hating all the soups and appertizer becuase of the weird ingredients in them.    
 After reading other reviews, I expected something a little more. Other than Gimme Little Sign, the first listen did not impress. Maybe it will grow on me. If not, my Daughter may like it 
 I had high hopes for this book, but was let down. The book is an academic work and is a boring read. It does not provide any real insight into the forming of Milestone Media. The author relies on other sources instead of actual interviews with the founders of the company. The author draws many conclusions based on his visits to comic conventions, stores, and interviews with fans 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 I just mailed those back this past week to Beall's in Florida.  However, when the mailman took it from my mailbox (I am 83 and no car) he brought it back the next day because of insufficient postage on it.  There was $l.71 due.  So, I put  (5) 39 cent stamps on it, which would have been  $1.95.  However, the next day the mailman brought it back and there were only 3 additional stamps instead of the 5 I  had put on  it.  I called the post office, and fortunately, the postmistress believed I was being honest, and told me to send it back with the mailman.  He wasn't a happy camper, but I did send it back, and I trust that she went ahead and mailed it for me.  I was concerned that it might have been too late for an exchange.  Other than the fact that the pants were too large in the legs and around the hips....they were okay, but by that time, I had changed my mind about them, too. Also, I had bought these with a gift certificate from my granddaughter and never could find a place to apply it. Jeanne Alle 
 My #1 use for this scanner is for public safety scanning - I have family in law enforcement & we like to listen in.  I own a Uniden BC248CLT, & for years I owned a BC80XLT handheld. My BC80XLT was recently damaged & needed replaced. I ordered this BC72XLT, & am ready to return it also. It is not anywhere near the quality my prior Uniden handheld was. My 80 picked up as well or better than my 248 does here at home. This 72 picks up maybe 50% of the traffic of my others--whether in the house, outside, or even right in town. The buttons on this are awful, too. I have to go through multiple steps to do things that took only 1 button press on the 80. The reception, though, is my biggest concern AND complaint.  I never had to purchase any extra antenna or such for my other Uniden handheld to get the better reception. Also, the volume, even at max output, is only "normal" listening level--so if I am in a noisy environment, I cannot turn it up to hear it better. My old BC80XLT had much better volume.  An additional warning - Uniden's Support has gone down the toilet. I thought Uniden was a company that would at least *acknowledge* my complaint, and maybe even have some suggestions of a better product - all I got was an auto reply that I should hear from Customer Service in 2-3 business days--and then I never heard a thing. I checked my support question on their site, and it was marked "closed." Good luck 
 With regard to concerns about the audio quality of the this MP3 version, the original audio CD version ("The Collector's Edition"), an 8-CD set, is still available from Amazon UK. I paid a little more than twice the MP3 price. The ISBN number of the Audio CD version is 0-563-47702-4 
 I remember reading Lynn's book "Excuse Me Your Life is Waiting" and it came at a turning point in my life and I inhaled it like a drowning man inhales air.  Having said that I can only shake my head in sadness for whatever must have happened to Lynn before she passed on. She kept saying in "Dear God! What's Happening to Us", that it sounded crazy and thats the ONE statement in that whole sad book that I agree wholeheartedly with.  I have no idea what happened to Lynn that took her off in what was obviously some sort of delusionment that flew in the face of all that she had written previously, but its very sad.  If you have ever read any of her previous work, please spare yourself the time and money and leave this sad tome on the shelf and remember Lynn when she obviously had all her faculties and was luci 
 This disc is BAD!!! Right at the 2" mark the sound of the "rock water" is join by what sounds like a slow draining bathtub. This sound is more or less present throughout the entire hour. Other discs of this type that I've heard don't do this 
 Can be easily captured without buying the DVD. Firstly, rip up $13. Then, beat yourself over the head with a hammer until your brains are coming out of your nose. Then, have Dana Carvey spit on you. Finally, shoot yourself in the stomach.  This movie is not funny, entertaining. It does not even have a remotely interesting story. As some of the other reveiwers have said, this movie has the same terrible joke, repeated throughout the whole movie.  Avoid this one like the plague 
 The author shows she is obviously making a transition from poetry to prose with this novel.  Her sentences are long and wordy, and her numerous metaphors make little sense in their context.  She goes to great lengths to describe many little and unimportant details, causing the actual story to suffer from lack of content.  Her descriptions of life in general seem unreal - she describes things and events in a way that no person would do in the circumstance.  The storyline is decent in some places, but it is generally hard for the reader to follow.  Many times, I had to go back to read paragraphs and pages again to realize where the author was going.  It is true there were many points in which I wanted to stop reading all together, which is a rarity.  I was altogether disappointed in the book.  I thought it would be decent, from all the literary awards it had won, but it really was just pages of fluff and poetry disguised as prose 
 This book is more a history of Bohemian style than anything else. The photos are uninspiring, dated and not at all what I considered "Bohemian" to be.  It was a total disappointment. It IS hard to find books that show you how to decorate in an eclectic, ethnic and Bohemian style which is what I was lookin for. In the end I've decided to add ALL ethnicities to my bedroom: Morrocan lamp, Mexican wrought-iron candelabra, Thai carved wood platform bed, rattan headboard, leopard skin chair, carved red Chinese armoire, and Indian-style entertainment cabinet!  Now that's what I'd call Bohemian 
 Yes, T&C is the oldest continually published magazine in the USA, and it's their 160th anniversary. However, I see little reason to celebrate.  Why? Because I fail to see how it's really improved over the years.   Nowadays, this magazine seems to cater far too much to the material lusts of the "nouveau riche". Back in the day when it was a true "high society" magazine, there were rather interesting and educational articles on the arts, literature and culture. It was beautiful and it really gave a person something to aspire to, but now just like so much of the rest of society has mutated into a lot of pretentious materialist wannabees bragging about "bling bling", so has this magazine.    There are far too many adverts for so-called "luxury goods" for my tastes, and although they put in a patronizing article about women over age 60 being the new "power" base, they insist on using only THIN 20-something models who probably can't afford the clothes they are modeling!  Articles wise, they are starting to sound more like Glamour or Cosmo than the erudite publication I used to enjoy buying on the newsstands 20 years ago.   Yes, T&C has changed with the times...but these are not good times if that is the case. It's too bad 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
  This movie started off with a promising atmosphere which hinted at fun and thrills to come, but is let horribly down by laughable special effects, paper-thin cliché'd characters and some cringingly awful acting.  The students (blonde bimbo, geeky nerd and sincere young thing with a crush on the stereotypical workaholic prof) heading off in their jeep into the wilderness certainly had potential, but any attempts to build a creepy atmosphere of isolation is diluted and spoiled by the intrusion of the weak and pointless sub-plot about an army special forces unit battling against insurgents.  This military operation (think Arnie's team in Predator meets the marines in Aliens) gives Coolio the stage to strut his stuff. But, I'm sorry to say, convincing he ain't.  Obliged to join forces with the students, the remainder of the film is basically a series of action set-pieces in which the humans battle it out with the pterodactyls. The ensuing gore is laid on in a very OTT style reminiscent of the Evil Dead series (but nowhere near as stylish) and creates a few (unintended?) laughs.  The 18 rating is certainly undeserved too - there are far more effective and scary 15's out there.  Even as straight to DVD `B' movies go, this is pretty poor fare. The final scene hints at a sequel - they really shouldn't bother 
 First off let me start off by saying that I am a very big fan of Edwin McCain, his band, and his music.  I bought this DVD thinking that there would be a good bit of live footage with him playing, but was only left with my pocket's empty, and my hopes shattered.  Edwin McCains personality is portrayed here, as all other reviewers have said, but that really is all that this DVD does well.  With only about 15 minutes of Live music I, as a viewer was left asking myself why Edwin and ATC Records decided to put this disc out.  The only notable music on this DVD is "I'll Be".  This is very easily Edwin's lowest quality item put out, lacking the passion, and originiality that so many of us know him by.  A noteworthy Story, if not the only one is the story of how he wrote I'll Be, and the only reason that it is noteworthy, is not because it is a great story, but rather I'll Be is a great track.  So if you have money to spare, and time to waste then you can buy this DVD, but unless Edwin releases a new DVD I suggest, that you stick to his CD's 
 The original Wild Things; you know, the one that was a bona-fide guilty pleasure/lurid trashy thriller, has now spawned not one, but two direct to video sequels.  Wild Things 2 was a waste, and Wild Things 3 is no different.  The story, if you want to call it that, is practically a carbon copy of the previous films where two sexy girls are in the center of twists and turns with loads of cash and murder in the mix.  There's twists aplenty here, all of which are pretty much non-sensical, and they're actually pretty predictable.  Mortal Kombat's Linden Ashby, who was in Wild Things 2, returns as a clueless detective, and Starship Troopers' Dina Meyer is here as well, for no apparent reason.  The girls are hot, and the steamy scenes between them are better and hotter than in Wild Things 2, but nothing can save this from being another needless and pointless direct to video sequel.  Stick with the original Wild Things; it wasn't a masterpiece, but it was a fun trash-noir thriller that was actually memorable 
 I bought this phone based on a review in Wired Magazine.  I love their reviews usually, but this one really let me down.  I read another customer's review (I forget where) saying they had sound quality problems, but I thought yeah right...one in a million.  Well I bought the phone and had the exact same experience.    Very poor sound/voice quality.  It sounded worse than a cell phone in an underground wind tunnel.  I cannot imagine why. I charged the battery for 48 hrs, I had it on a separate circuit, and it had it's own line. I plugged in an old GE 2,4 ghz phone an whamo...no troubles what so ever. Needless to say,  I took the phone back and bought a cheap desk phone with a cord.  Sometimes you don't get what you pay for 
 well i bought this series agaisnst the star rating it has and i can only say that in my humble opinion it is badly written the acting is ham,and the actors of a standard that do not rate on a scale of 1 to 10 and i do not mean they score higher than ten. i cannot understand its  five star rating as comparing it with other series such as medium, numbers,waking the dead,it should never have got passed the pilot.if i could i would rate it 0 stars.if there is a secound series i will not be buying it.  
 Arthur Seldon uses Abraham Lincoln as an example of a leader who believed in limited government, "of the people, by the people, and for the people".  In actuality, Lincoln lead a failed government attempt at state railroad building when he was in the Illinois legislature.  He instituted the first conscription in the United States, and the first income tax.  He lead the charge of an unconstitutional export tax on Southern cotton and then an actual blockade.  He intimidated the Supreme Court and executed Union soldiers for sleeping on duty.  Seldon should do a bit of reading about Lincoln before he uses him as an icon for small government.  I, personally, was so turned off by the introduction that I couldn't bring myself to read the book 
 AFTER LISTLENING TO THIS CD A COUPLE OF TIMES AND WATCHING DR. KNOW PLAY WITH BRANDON CRUZ I THINK THAT THIS CD IS WORTH EVERY PENNY.IF YOU CALL YOURSELF A DR.

 This pair clearly knows what they are doing, but who in their right mind would spend millions to live in a bad derivative of Dorothy Draper and Sister Parrish? Their use of clashing patterns and brilliant color is one step away from a nervous breakdown. In a vigilent attempt to get press (and boy have they), they have masterminded an attention getting style that has kept them on the forefront of shelter magazines for two decades, yet they are clearly the laughing stock of thier peers. Pity they could not do something original AND liveable. Now that would have been brilliant 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 I prefer a mixture of music on a cd, not all slow, and not all fast 
 I regret I did not read some of the other below-3-star reviews before I bought this book - all of those comments are true.  First of all, the text is impossible to read. One would have thought font size is a trivial point when it comes to the quality of a book, but trust me, it is not.  After just 5 minutes with this book my head was swimming.  Even the captions to the photos are quite difficult to read.  Apart from the awful presentation, the author has little to offer readers: (1) Contents - if you are new to interior design, this book does not give any systematic, practical and to-the-point tips to get you started.  Nor is it well-organized. I was expecting to learn the basics on the historical influences on style - the book does have a chapter on this topic, but it failed miserably to point out the key differences of different periods nor is it sufficiently illustrated.  Everything is in a muddle.   There is indeed a few glossaries of terms in the book, but I seriously wonder if it would be relevant for most amateur decorators, for example, the ones for fabric and period furniture. (2) Images - as one has to give up on reading the text of this book, one naturally turns to the photos in hope of finding design inspirations.  As some of the other reviewers so rightly pointed out, the design images selected in this book is far from impressive.  They may not be to the extreme of being ugly, but certainly one would find better styled pictures in any furniture catalogue, say even from Ikea.  In summary, the book does not deliver what it promises in the title - I do not feel I have learnt anything useful or practical that I can immediately apply to decorating.  If you are an absolute beginner to interior design and looking for practical tips on decorating, I would highly recommend the "Essentials" series ("Living Room Essentials, Bedroom Essentials, Bathroom Essentials etc) which offer easy-to-read, instructional and user-friendly knowledge.  The designs featured in the books can often be easily emulated at any budget.  If you are however more interested in the asthetics and styling aspects of decorating, you might find books like "New York Apartments" more inspirational as they feature stunning design projects, often by award-winning architects or interior designers.  
 I attempted to watch DARK DESCENT but failed. I saw enough to recognize that this seemed to be a remake of OUTLAND which in turn was a Sci-Fi translation of HIGH NOON. Both OUTLAND and HIGH NOON are classics with great casts and well crafted scripts, but DARK DESCENT is a remake of these classics only in the sense that Frankenstein's Monster is a recreation of humanity. Some of the parts are there, but you don't want to take them home. There is a lot of dialogue, none memorable, and little action. The plot pacing favors insomniacs. Many of the actors are unknown even in their own native countries, whatever they may be. Let's not forget the special features, which consist of a menu that offers a single "choice": "play movie", thus demonstrating that the menu's only useful function is to demonstrate that it has no useful function. I gave the movie one star because it is better than daytime television, but my advise is get OUTLAND and watch the best Space Western ever made 
 While reading this book, I remembered a story of "Four Blind Men and an Elephant" that I have heard since my childhood days. The story goes like this:   Four BLIND MEN decided to "see" an elephant for the first time. When they were near one each tried to understand how it looks like. Being blind by birth, they decided to touch and feel the elephant and each one started to describe it one by one.  One of them said, by holding its tail in hand, "I know how the elephant looks like, it is like a long rope" and thus announced his great discovery to other three blind men.  Immediately another blind man who was holding one of its legs said, "No, you are not correct, it is like a pillar!" He sounded very confident!  In the meantime, yet another said, "No, you both are terribly wrong! It is like a long tube"! He was holding its long trunk.  The fourth person disagreed with all the other three and said "No, it is like a big round rock" and he was holding its body by the belly.  So, if you are not blind you know how the elephant looks like and you know for sure it does not fit into any of these descriptions proposed by the four blind men.  But all of them were so confident and each tried to describe to the other, but no one finally had true knowledge about how the elephant looks like.   Think about this situation. When these men go back home and they all try to explain it to others, what would be the end result? And if those who heard from these four blind men in turn explain it to yet others, it would be no less than a catastrophy!    Unfortunately, the author of this book Mr. Rabi (Mr. Rabindranath R. Maharaj) in fact was surrounded by a group of people who were "Blind" to "True Spirit of Hinduism" (it is very evident from lot of conversations honestly portrayed by the Author himself in the book that none of them were qualified in scriptural knowledge of "Hindu way of life" the modern name of "Sanatana Dhrama") who were shaping his childhood basic lessons in spirituality and that too in a land far away from the root of Hinduism. Mr. Rabi was too focused on "Brahman" concept and he saw the "LIGHT" (or Brahman radiance/energy which is neutral to everything, focussed in maintaining the material manifestations and it sure lacked in Love) and missed the "SUN" (The Supreme Personality of God, the source of pure Divine Love) which emits it.  I would never criticize Mr. Rabi for writing this book (like others) but rather appreciate his openness in admitting his failure and his reasons in not understanding Hindu religion so that others can learn from him and avoid those mistakes. Also I feel very sorry for the poor guidance he got from the people around him when he was sincerely trying to follow a faith that he once tried to believe in. His father might have been a great Yogi for many, but was of no use for anyone in showing the right path and not even for his son who was craving for God's love. Or may be he too was merged deep into the neutral nature of Brahman effulgence! This path to God has been highly discouraged by Krishna himself in Bhagavat-Gita! Thus lack of proper guidance and emergence of "Self made FALSE Hindu GURUS" in this world is eating into the very base and existence of Sanatana Dharma (or Hindu way of life).   Same way many "Hindu born" persons fall prey to other religion and faith, thanks to their understanding based on a blind man's theory of the "elephant" which ends in conversion. This book would be a "Very Good Tool" for converting those who are weak in Hindu (Sanatana Dharma) scriptural knowledge! Well done Mr. Rabi!   One message for the author: If you were looking for love of God and would like to experience and nourish it through the study of Vedic scriptures (of Sanatana Dharma), please read BHAGAVATHAM, (it describes the personality of the Supreme, his Love and His activities and one of the best admired English translations is about 17,000+ pages written by Srila Prabhupada) and you can relish it for rest of your life and fill-up your consciousness with full blown true love for God (in his special personal form) which would ultimately result in reaching the Heavenly Father (through Moksha) in the spiritual realm of the Supreme as stated by God in Bhagavad-Gita.   As always, true guidance from a self-realized person is required for understanding the true meaning of the scriptures and of course, true devotion to God is a must. Otherwise, your chances of getting lost in the vastness of its knowledge is very high.  Hinduism has answers and methods for fulfilling all kinds of desires (material and spiritual) and in the end when a living entity (after several life times having enjoyed material life in return for positive karma or even sufferred enough for negative karma accumulated through various free will actions) desires for getting connected back to God (his original father) it shows the right way only through a qualified teacher (Guru) who could guide you in the right direction otherwise you would follow the wrong scripture and rituals and could even mistake Kamasutra (if you have only read "Kamasutra" while trying to understand Hinduism) as the designated way to spirituality.  This would be like the blind man's description of elephant.   Ultimately any practice or faith that promotes love for God and His creation need to be encouraged and every true faith should teach ONLY that. No faith should teach hatred towards another faith. No faith should use false information about another faith for "Selling" its own Theory of God and Love even if it is true.  In the end, faith or belief is not important, but Love that has developed is important. After all, God does not belong to or follow any faith or religion!   Krishna has rightly said in Bhagavad-Gita: "Leave all forms of religious worship and just surrender unto me and you shall come to me without fail". So, why should there be any fight between religion, faith or belief? Know that nothing matters in the end except Love between God and Man to return to the Original Eternal Home! 
 We bought this book for our 2 year old daughter, and even I had trouble putting the valentines into the slots.  The valentine was not very durable, and was starting to rip already after the first time we read it together.  I was very disappointed and returned the book.  It was not up to Sesame Street standards.  Try "Elmo Loves You" instead 
 This is a beautiful board in theory.  I like the concept of the angel markers in various colors, along with the crystal dice.  Therein lies the problem. I don't see where tiny dots on a pair of dice can ever correspond to an honest answer, unless of course one knows how to divine with dice.  Divination with dice should be the ultimate objective of Angel Guidance, with a transition to oracle cards or some such for additional clarification if need be.  Unfortunately, this board is not designed this way.  This board fails the moment the holder of the dice is meant to use the number of dots to move the marker several paces up a chart of words and phrases.  Divination then becomes a game, and that game is not always fun.  The answers do not always fit the questions.  It can be like forcing a square peg into a round hole.  Some answers may be too general or too sugar coated.  The holder of the dice may have additional questions, or may find the need to problem solve.  The author has left no room for any additional clarification on issues that may arise after a marker lands on any word or phrase.  Unlike tarot, there are no symbols or pictures to interpret.  It's just simple words that fall flat.  The provided guide book is of little help either.  Yikes!  I will give this two stars, only because I like the crystal dice.  My advice?  Learn how to divine with dice and go from there.  Toss out the so called board.  It's crap 
 I could not have been more disappointed in a book! This book offers no real spritual inspiration. Maybe Frank Peretti has become enchanted by the Bigfoot legend but this book is far and away his worst. The plot is weak, character development is terrible and the ending is anti-climactic. Extremely disappointing!  Sometimes good authors feel obliged to publish a book, maybe he was pressured, who knows. This is even close to the same caliber of Piercing the Darkness or This Present Darkness 
 Amazon never sent the correct order.  I spend 2 hours on the phone trying to get them to send the right item.  I eventually had to decline the order on the 3rd time not getting the correct amount of pop-tarts.  They kept sending once box when i was supposed to get 12 
 This book is a pioneering effort to simplify network analysis for the unitiated but... there are too many eccentricities and mistakes for this tome to be taken seriously as either  a technical guide (see Wasserman and Faust) or a sociological simplification 
    This is  largely the same team of Letters who do the majority of  lettering for Image Comics, and maybe one day when they decite to do it for a more professional comics company, then they can write a book like this, until then, NO SALE 
 My wife and I are tired of cleaning up after our 4 cats. Though the Catgenies are terribly expensive to purchase and to keep stocked with Sanisolution and granules, it would be worth it for more free time and a cleaner basement. Unfortunately, they just don't work.  Becuase we have 4 cats we bought 2 Catgenies. Even with 2 of them it was more than the machines can handle. Even when we ran them right after the cats made their deposit the impeller was never able to grind up the turds properly. They clogged everytime and beeped incessantly.  Another problem is the scoop. Even though it scoops 3 times for every cycle, it always left turds behind. Those turds would then go through the whole cyle, which includes drying. That means that, even if they're scooped up the next time it cycles, they're going to be so dry and hard they'll never be ground up properly. Again, this results in clogs.  We had them for a little over 2 weeks. In that time we had to run extra cyles, backflush and even take them apart and clean them.  This product results in far more work, not less

 I had not realized what great performers Michael Flatley, Colin Dunne and Jean Butler were until I watched this version of Riverdance. The lead dancers in this version are not in the same league and much of the performance is sloppy compared to previous versions. What made Riverdance great for me was the precision, timing, and dancers dancing togeather in the Irish dance numbers. It is all gone here. Try "Riverdance: Live from New York City" or the video tape "Riverdance: The Show" instead. This version should not have been released 
 What can I say of something that bad? This movie sucks.   I waste my money and time buying this pathetic movie 
 For me, this pill does nothing to suppress my appetite. Actually, it seems that I was more hungry on it, and I don't know how that could be! For the first couple of days, my stomach was gurgling and it scared me but it went away. I have taken the pills for about a month, and no weight loss!! I will not get another bottle when I'm done. BTW, i am exercising too. 
 I ordered a 6th edition of the book, but was sent the 5th edition, which is useless for my class.  The order arrived 2 days before my class starts.  I have assignment due the first day of class being a graduate class.  I have about 150 pages to read, and a paper to write, and have no time to deal with this mess.  Trying to find a contact phone number for Amazon was impossible as well.  This was a big shocker and a great disappointment in the whole ordeal of on-line ordering from Amazon and its third party 
 Is it possible to write a novel that features Carnivale in Venice, sexy vampires and serial murder and still have it turn out completely boring? Yes. All the elements were there for a good story but it never quite meshed. There are endless repetitive scenes of the main character Jordan attending one party after another when she's not busy (stupidly) following a lone man in a dottore mask through the dark streets. The romance between Jordan and Rangor, the mysterious vampire, is plodding and unbelieveable. Rangor does absoulutely nothing that explains why Jordan would fall in love with him. Through most of the book he mainly stalks her and speaks in crypic messages. By the same token, this world-travelled immortal's fascination with the dull and ordinary Jordan is unexplainable. When their big love scene *finally* arrives it's a big letdown because the characters are so poorly drawn that you just don't care about them. Scenes that are supposed to be spooky come off as laughable, like when Jordan goes into a desecrated church and finds her friend's body on the altar and when she touches it, her head rolls off! The book only gets interesting near the end when Rangor's past life as a Viking warrior is revealed -finally some action. Too late to save the story, alas 
 Another reviewer has stated that Mark often.It's good songs.Small package.Bring home some milk ok?It gets out stains too 
 If you read between the lines on all these glowing reviews, you will find out that this is a ridiculous movie with some good (not great) acting.  Jessica Lange basically does an impression of Marilyn Monroe with a southern accent.  Well not all of the time, since her accent seems to come and go.  The amount of effort that you will spend trying to suspend your disbelief will negate any good qualities this movie has.  Skip it unless you really, really, really love Jessica Lange.  By the way, if this movie is set in the early sixties, why does the daughter have a peace sign on her bedroom wall?  This is the same daughter that finds a grenade in a drawer and promptly pulls the pin and tosses it to her boyfriend! Puh-lease 
 Ho hum--I will never get my 5th grader to read this tome--however moving the story line and imagery.  It is too thick to easily add to a history block of Ancient Civilizations around the world.  The language is too dated.  The narrations dwarfs the action.  Children today (and writers for children are directed to SHOW the meaning and NOT TELL IT.)   Thankfully, author Geraldine McCaughrean wrote a wonderfully telling of GILGAMESH, so I turned around and ordered her retelling of ODYSSEUS.    Does anyone want my copy of Padric's version.  The cover art is great. 
 I received the wrong size and color. I returned the product and was told that a refund would be credited to my account.....I am still waiting.....was told that amazon forbids seller to ship a replacement item 
 Now, before the "Castle if Mirrors", I was a big Charlie Bone fan, I could not wait for this book to come out.  All of the other books had unique interesting plots.  However by the time Nimmo got to this book, she lost her touch.  For example, this book had way to much "Harry Potter" take offs, which you could easily find if youve read both books and paid even the slightest attention.  Also so much of the information in this book was completely pointless and overloaded (unless she plans to use it for her later books.  And what was really corny was  the whole new thing about one of the characters who  has already been in the other books has just suddenly gained a power. Anways, readof you like, but I don't know if it will be worth it 
 ...or at least don't read THIS book about it.  What a mess.  This is one of the most nastily-written books that I can think of, and how can you be nasty when writing about something as delicious as PIE?  I agree with the other reviewer who didn't dare donate this book to the charity book sale!  Directly into the trash bin! 
 If you do not know basic word like PITHY, STOLID, then I recommend you buy the book. And if you feel like you are more advanced, then buy a harder book than this one 
 Frame's attempt to make a consistent CHristtian epistomology creates more confusion than anything else. THe principles set forth in this book hinder comunication and any sort of theological or philosophical fine-tuning by  reducing meaning to application and providing mulitiple perspectives of  looking at everything. Rather than a step in the right direction of greater  precision in understanding, it is two steps backwards toward theological  confusion in the cloak of philosphical sophistication 
 Got to be the toughest piece of leather a cow has ever produced!  I've literally never had a pair of boots that need THIS much breaking in and I own LOTS of boots.  Makes me not even want to to wear them 
 Ok...so everyone is getting wounded in this tale from Feehan.  Seems like no one stays in one piece and about 1/3 of this book is fixing people up and giving each other blood.  Shea is abused, injured, throat ripped out, and second degree burns caused by the sun ... well...in my opinion none of this should happen because it isn't very well address or even believably described. Jacques is badly wounded and this surgeon (Shea) ....while in the middle of the woods in a third world country and on the run from people who want to kill her...sets up an operating room just in case anyone may need surgery while they happen by her isolated cottage. HUH???  Is this a joke?   So wonder what happens to the hero and heroine?  Well if you ever read a Feehan ....exactly the same thing that happens in all her books.     So why do I keep buying them?  I ask myself over and over again WHY?  Feehan does put a lot of energy into that first two or three chapters.  I always believe that I am going to LOVE it, that this book will be different,  but she gets into her same old routine and nothing new EVER happens.      
 As below, this book does not include birds in the other peterson guides.  Far better books are out there 
 Maybe i'm not as cultured as some of the people who rated this book, but i have read the likes of Jane Austen and Louisa May Alcott and i think it is safe for this to be a true review. Please, please don't put yourself through the torment of reading this book, it is probably the worst book i have ever read. It goes on and on about the littlest of details which don't have anything to do with the book. I read this when i was 11 and it is safe to say i wasn't too immature to read it. Everyone in my class read it and i'm pretty sure we all had the same opinions, it really sucked. I would tell you the worst part of the book, but that would ruin the story. But let me just tell you a little tip, don't read it. Don't read it, don't read it, don't read it. I tried to read it again last year and i couldn't put myself through the pain and torment of reading the worlds worst book. Don't waste your money or waste a part of your life reading a book about nothing 
 I have used Turbo Tax for at least past eight years and always have been very pleased with it. This year however some "genius" decided to change the entire format and approach and I found this year's version to be terrible. Very confusing now when used to be clear and simple. Hard to even download, confusing up dates, difficult to find numerous frequently used items (estimated taxes paid in previous year, capital gains/losses, state taxes paid, and more). The running total of taxes owed in upper left hand corner came out different from final taxes supposedly owed.     I have zero confidence in this year's program doing my taxes correctly so will have to have an accountant do return for first time in many years. Have recommended Turbo Tax to many over the years, but would strongly recommend against buying this year's product. A perfect example of how to take something good and make it lousy by messing with it. Suggest you save your money and either go to an accountant or use another firms software, this one stinks 
 I worked my way through this,and kept asking myself why. This book is the product of a certain mind set in this country that props up certain points of views and tries to silence others, there simply is no other way to explain how this got published and, pick my jaw up off the floor, a movie made.  The writing is totally uninspired. Likewise the, uhh...plot. If there is a character, meaningful dialog, descriptive passage somewhere in this thing, please invite my attention. Swofford accomplishes only one thing: makes you real happy you don't have to spend time with him other than when you are struggling with his book. It doesn't matter how you feel about war, politics, life, or anything, this is just hard labor. Yes, I've done my time in the military and in combat. Swofford can't tell anyone anything, about the Corps, any military, combat, life, or putting one foot in front of another each day. Sadly, I think that this is a tragedy, because he had the opportunity to experience much, some of it even positve, but he missed it all. The people who put their names on the cover of this book and gave it favorable comment are dispicable 
 I decided to read a book on the five-hour flight from MCO to LAX, and then on the return flight of something less than five hours.  (Flying downwind eastbound, of course.)  I purchased "The Aquataine Progression" by Robert Ludlum, in paperback form.  (I must admit that I still can't get used to spending $7.95 for a paperback book!  But, the horrors of inflation obviously continue to haunt us into the 21st century, and beyond.  This promised to be worth the price inasmuch as it was touted as a "New York Times Bestseller.")  I got to Page 17 of the 658-page book before I gagged.  I managed to read only a few more pages before I set it aside disgustedly.  I quote from the book to explain why:  "Lieutenant Senior Grade Gordon Ramsey had been hit by a fluke rocket that had winged out of its trajectory over the coastline and in on Ramsey's fuselage; the explosion had filled the jet streams" - - (etc).  This almost stopped me in my tracks.  The reason for my hesitancy being the fact that there is no such grade or rank in the US Navy as "Lieutenant Senior Grade."  My inclination is to think that a noted author like Robert Ludlum (or the editor at Bantam Books) should know that while there is, indeed, a rank of "Lieutenant Junior Grade" in the US Navy, there (conversely) is NO such rank as, "Lieutenant Senior Grade."  (The ranks of "Ensign," "Lieutenant Junior Grade" and "Lieutenant" equate to "Second Lieutenant," "First Lieutenant" and "Captain" in all other branches of service except the US Coast Guard which echoes the rank structure of the Navy.  Most confusing, of course, is that the rank of "Captain" in the Navy is equivalent to "Colonel" in the other services. )  I swallowed my disapproval, and continued to read.  But then, the author goes on to tell us that the skipper of the aircraft carrier, a Captain, calls in our protagonist, a Lieutenant Junior Grade, to inform him that he is being promoted to squadron commander after "Lieutenant Senior Grade" Ramsey met his fate with the rocket as previously mentioned.  Here again, I blanched.  A skipper of an aircraft carrier would hardly deal directly with a Lieutenant "Jay Gee" (JG, for "Junior Grade") to inform him of such a thing.  There are, of course, officers of intervening rank and intervening commands and responsibilities below that of the skipper of the ship. You would have other Commanders, Lieutenant Commanders, and Lieutenants who would be in the chain of command between the skipper and the protagonist.  If there's one thing that's paramount in the military, its delegation of authority!  It would certainly be somebody else who would inform the JG of his "promotion."  So, I had to swallow hard, again, and go along with the absurd notion that a Lt. JG would report directly to a Captain, let alone the skipper of the boat.  Then, while these two are conferring, a four-star general shows up unannounced via a tender to chew-out the Navy Captain.  Aw, come on.  Between the four-star and the Captain are three-star generals, two-star generals and one-star generals.  The chain of command would insert these people into the mix well before a four-star would come and deal directly with a four-striper, let alone "chew him out."  After all, one is ARMY, and the other is NAVY.  The ticked-off general would vent his anger through not only his own chain of command, but decidedly through the chain of command of the US Navy.  I swallowed hard, again, but kept reading.  Now, what happens is that the general proceeds to chew-out the captain while the JG is still present in the quarters.  BIG SWALLOW this time.  NEVER in military protocol or in the constraints of military courtesy would a senior officer berate a junior officer in front of somebody who was junior to THAT officer!  It just does NOT happen - - except in B-grade movies that aren't worth the price of admission.  Not only that, but we are now supposed to believe that the JG interrupts the general, and tells him that he's off base for berating the captain.  I almost upchucked!  The captain dismisses the JG, but he refuses to leave (yeah, sure!) and continues to give the general a piece of his mind.  (Yeah sure, again.)  After all, he's a hot-rock fighter pilot, and he's not gonna let some four-star berate the skipper that just promoted him to squadron commander, right?  The general absorbs the static from the JG, but "orders" the Captain to launch a strike despite the unfavorable and deteriorating weather over the target.  He calls the captain "chicken" if he doesn't order the strike, and calls the JG "chicken" if he doesn't fly it.  So, the JG and everybody else fly the mission rather than being labeled as "chicken" despite the previous critical decision regarding unfavorable weather (which, of course, is a ridiculous contention) and the JG gets shot down.  Okay, this is a far as I got in the book.  It's just entirely too hollow and too outlandish in its premise to entice me to read any further.  This sophomoric rhetoric brings this book down to comic-book level.  I can't believe the blurb that says this bookspent time on the best seller list of the New York Times!  But then, I guess that inasmuch as so few of the American public will spend any time in military service these days, this kind of bull-loney can pass for "real world" scenarios and the author can weave such bull-loney into a "believable" plot.  It's a shame.  And, so is this book!  Carl B. Jordan   
 Just back from a 9 day backpacking trip in Utah, using both this book and Adkison's book on Escalante. It left me with poor trail descriptions, (scarily) poor or wholly incorrect maps, and an "interesting" (read: madman-style insane) style of giving directions to trailheads. I am by no means new to the outdoors, nor to getting to remote trailheads, routefinding, etc; I can say with a degree of confidence that this is the poorest guidebook I have ever purchased. The second star is given for his "reccomended" hikes, which were, on the whole, generally right on 
 The book is absurd.  Rose reifies "culture," assuming that it is a property of "children" or "adults."  As a result, she fails to recognize that the process of enculturation is actually a sharing  of cultural resources rather than a colonialist imposition of cultural  hegemony. Furthermore in using Freudian psychoanalysis, she undermines her  counterhegemonic cultural critique, as Freud, himself, maintained a view  that "the child" is less than the civilized adult.  As a result  of these two fatal errors, her analysis is bogus 
 My 2 1/2 year old son loves this book and I think most children familiar with the movie will because it presents familiar characters and situations.  But it feels *so* incredibly tossed off!  The writing is slapdash, lackluster and just pathetically bad.  Good storytelling is more than just hitting the high notes of a film -- if you're going to bother making a book, it should read well *as a book*.  This book lacks the heart and soul that actually "animates" the movie 
 Find the Bathrooms First is an outline to what could have been a very useful book.  Unfortunately it is light on examples, runs out of steam, and is weakly written.  Great books like this follow a pattern of make-a-point/tell-a-story.  The book makes many points, but it does them in a rapid fire fashion and never gives examples or stories that bring it home to the reader.  What results is a list of ideas without a picture of how they hang together.   The book offers a six week program, but the authors ran out of steam on week 5 and week 5 and 6 are only one page each.  The writing is weak.  Here is a typical passage, "Unfortunately, sometimes once you are part of an organization, you begin to come across skeletons in their closet."  The equivocation sucks all the life out of this sentence.    This unwillingness to make a strong statement is helpful in face-to-face conversations but makes for dreadful reading.  The sentence should have read, "All organizations have skeletons in their closets and it's only a matter of time until you find them in your new organization."  The book also needs more copy editing.  For example, the author is an alumni of my school, the Univeristy of Massachusetts at Amherst (not Amhurst.)  There are other distractions of this type.  I gave this book two stars (instead of one) because the information is genuinely useful and if you follow the steps in this book you'll be better off than if you don't.  
 Sorry guys, but after all the hype that was building up to the initial release of the Blue Lion Collection here, I am extremely disappointed about the final product here.    OK, first of all I was a big fan of this show back in '84 and '85....but that was when I was only like 10 or so.  So, weigh that in with what I have to say below.  So 20+ years later, even after restoration, the animation in this series just doesn't hold up.  From the crudely animated environment to the pencil like drawings of the lions and Voltron, to the terribly animated mouth movements, the animation is just horrible compared to the 3D enhanced animation we get today in modern animated shows like Justice League and other mainstream anime series.  Oh, one note about the restoration itself.  If this is restored, I'd hate to see what it was like prior to restoration.  It still looks pretty bad, IMO.    Another thing I find disturbing is the juvenile dialogue.  Very childish dialogue on top of very childish voice-overs.  I mean it's not even funny.  It's like the scrounged the bottom of the barrel to get these actors to voice this show.  I guess I'm just spoiled now that modern animated show get some top voice actors to give life to the characters.  I bought this collection with the intention of buying the whole set, but after struggling to get through the 15 episodes, I'm not gonna waste any more of my time or money on this badly aged series.  If I may say so myself, the packaging is the only redeeming feature of this set.  Shame the series itself isn't any better.   Now, if they were to ever release the 3D CGI animated version of Voltron, I'd buy that set in an instant.  That one was for a much mature audience.  Hopefully it'll see the light of day soon.  IIRC, it was only 26 episodes or so, so a 4 disc set would catch that one 
 I read the reviews for this mix album and it seemed like i couldnt be getting a better cd but i was pretty dissapointed. I liked the Cosmos cd and some previous G.Communication but this mix isnt what i expected. It starts out promising but quickly changes with a selection of pretty shameful hip hop. I am a big hip hop fan and the stuff on here doesnt do the mix any favours. I also thought the change of tempos was a bit jumpy and it just never seems to go anywhere. I was waiting for some good tech house to kick in but it is all a bit 'bar friendly' if you know what i mean. If you are looking for good Fabriclive compilations i'd go for.....Freestylers, Plump Djs, James Lavelle and Aim. This one just didnt impres 
 This is the worst popular science book I've read. I will defer to the above reviews, by those trained in science, for specific examples of misinformation in this book, but despite that I am only trained as a diesel mechanic, I began finding statements which made me utter, "Say, whaa'?" and "I don't think so," throughout the book. By the time I reached the part where objects have "swelled" and "puffed out" as they near the speed of light, I knew I was reading buncombe, as I had been taught in high school that they instead become shorter.  The section which concerns the development of the atomic bomb is likewise botched. That it covers this topic and completely ignores Leo Szilard, the man who not only conceived of the atomic bomb but held patents on both the bomb and the nuclear reactor, shows just how worthless this book is. It is ironic that credit for America's starting work on a nuclear program is given to Einstein here, because, contrary to the book, Einstein did not write the letters that were delivered to Roosevelt. He only signed letters that Szilard had written and Szilard handed them to Alexander Sachs to be delivered to Roosevelt. Indeed, Einstein had no inkling that an atomic bomb was possible. Once Szilard explained the concept of a fission bomb to him, Einstein admitted, "Huh! That never occurred to me."  The book's account of German's progress toward a bomb is likewise distorted. On 6 August, 1945, the team of German atomic scientists, who where interned in England, were placed in a room with hidden microphones and given the news that the USA had destroyed Hiroshima with an atomic bomb. At first they were unanimous in their disbelief, but after hearing further radio reports of it, they assumed that the USA had somehow dropped an entire nuclear reactor on the city.    This, and a far more accurate account of the German nuclear program can be found in the book "Alsos" by Samuel Goudsmit (pronounced "Howd-shmid"; a fine book profiling the people who worked on the Manhattan Project is "The Uranium People" by Leona Libby; and the best overall account of the development of nuclear weapons is the magnificent "Day One" by Peter Wyden.  "E=mc2" is not only infested with misinformation, but it is hideously written. Tortured sentences, errant punctuation, dangling modifiers, and one handsome redundancy. Near the beginning of the book, Bodanis, in describing the development of the period (.) describes it as "a round circle." A round circle! You know, as opposed to some other type of circle, such as a triangular circle or a square one?   If, as he claims, David Bodanis really taught at Oxford, then all I can say is, poor ol' Oxford ain't what it usta be. 
 This movie could have been so much more than it is. It offers up more wasted potential than an "American Idol" audition.  First, there's the angle of the absent father. While we're thrown some teasers - and even a pseudo-reunion between him and Ely - we are not ultimately emotionally satisfied with the outcome. There's no real resolution, no deep truth.  Then there's the angle of the "love triangle." This never took off, simply because Celia and Hank had no further interaction once she and Ely took up together. And then, Ely parted ways with her entirely. Through all this, Hannah delivers no stunning performance. Her character is fairly two-dimensional at best.  And then there's the "drive to win" that Ely is supposed to evince. This never really appears. We're just supposed to understand how driven he is by his brooding looks and foolhardy acts.   I will give kudos to the slow motion filming sequences in the beginning and the end. They are affective. However, we could've done with a little less bull drool flying through the air like a trapeze act.   All in all, this movie is plagued by wasted potential. The waste of Molly Ringwald's character is especially troubling. Why even introduce her, if she isn't going to play a pivotal role in what happens with Ely and Hank? A lot of this film seeming plodding and pointless.   I wanted to like this movie. I truly did. I'm a whopping huge PBR fan, and desperately wanted to like this movie. However, the movie itself prevented me from doing so.  
 In my opinion of "Travels with Charley," Steinbecks depicts a society in a search of something. I like the way he describes that hunger for travel," ...not toward something but away from something (P10)," which is true not only for Americans but also for most people in the planet. Nevertheless, I did not find the book appealing or interesting enough. It was not one of those books that you cannot put down. His sophisticated writing styles made it difficult to follow for ESL students and for non-native speakers 
 The only cake I actually considered from this book was the one on the cover.  I was not pleased with many of the other selections on the inside.  If you are looking for something traditional, which I am, then this book is probably not for you.  Even if you were to find something you liked, I must caution you that this book lacks the instructions needed to be provided to a baker/designer in order to accomplish the re-creation of many of these cakes.  There are some impressive masterpieces in this book but none that I haven't already seen displayed in various bridal magazines that I have previously purchased.  Also, the cakes in this book carry a heavty price tag so be prepared to go over budget if you decide to set your heart on one of them 
 I have watched all of Jack Black's films and I have found this one to be his worst. My Wife and I couldn't keep from sleeping through it. I will admit that there were some silly parts and somewhat funny parts, but for the most part we had to force ourselves to laugh at this ridiculous movie. I'll more cautious before I rent another Jack Black movie. I hope this doesn't ruin his career 
 I couldn't get this product to work with my existing equipment.  The Netgear extender had a default IP address of 192.168.0.101.  Linksys routers serve IP addresses in the 192.168.1.x range.  I couldn't get beyond this incompatibility.  My search of the Internet for a solution only found more people reporting the same problem.  I finally returned the Netgear extender for an equivalent Linksys product which I had no problem getting to work.  
 The minute I took it out of the box I knew I would return it. And that was before I even opened the book! The pages aren't numbered but it appears to have about 25 pages in it. Taking the price into consideration that comes to almost $1 a page. Additionally, inside there are many blank areas to write your ideas on so ultimately I was spending $19.95 for a note pad. Too bad. Everyone else seemed to love the ideas the author presented. I couldn't get past the feeling of being cheated to even read her ideas 
 I bought this item despite the review that said it was too small. Big mistake. It is small! It's not big enough for my 21 months old. I'm very dissapointed because I liked the infant version.  
 Ordered two frames from the third party source.  Neither on of them worked at all.  It has been a nightmare trying to return them for a refund 
 Don't be misled.  Because Thomas Berry is promoted as a Catholic priest, many people are falsely led to believe that his books present Catholic or Christian teaching about the environment.  Instead, this book presents a New Age blend of do-it-yourself religion mixed with pseudo-science.  If you're into that, you'll probably like this book.. 
 Like many of the readers, I agree that Ms. Evanovich seems to have run out of ideas.  The series could be written by a twelve year old.  Just give them a checklist- blow up car, eat donuts, feed Rex a donut/grape/piece of pizza, eat donuts, vascilate between Ranger and Joe, eat six tastykakes.  You get the idea.  Ms. Evanovich did expand the plot a little with this book, though.  She added in Ranger's shower gel to the list.  It was only mentioned every other paragraph.  Might I add that I have never smelled a shower gel that lingers quite like his supposedly does.  Seriously, the books went downhill after the sixth installment.  If Ms. Evanovich cannot expand the plots and allow more character growth rather than rehashing the same events over and over, perhaps she should consider ending the series.  
 the movie title itself says a lot, the movie itself is a total scam, fools people to rent or to watch it. a horrible directing, script and performance. you'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain-dean bad movie 
 Note that the paperback version is the student study companion to the hardback book, not a paperback version of the original text 
 Another simplistic, generic, super conventional, template-derived, power-pop emo band. If they had any respect for music they would stop what they're doing right now 
 Nicky Cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment, as he turns  in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movi 
 While this book had some good ideas, I thought his advise to men to sleep around after a break up was very irresponsible. He admits that many men will be prone to use sex at this time in an addictive way, to numb their feelings, so why encourage them to do so? Even worse, what about the feelings of the women that these men will be USING for their "healing" sex?? nobody deserves to be used that way 
 Maybe it was the editing or the translation, but this book was a long and frustrating waste of time.    There was no spark in the writing, plot or characters.  It was as if everyone was either on Prozac or needed it!  I was really let down because the middle started getting more interesting so I kept reading, thinking it would finish strongly, but was disappointed.  Actually, the only reason I am writing this is because I was taken in by the many 4 and 5 star ratings and am pissed off that I was duped!!   
    The author of the review "Bad" could not have been more on-target. (And now I will proceed to be similarly lambasted by those of you who deem my articulate review "unhelpful" simply because I don't agree with you that this book will solve all of the world's problems. Thus, since I write negative reviews AS WELL AS positive ones, I will certainly never challenge anyone's "Top 100 reviewer" status.... but that's another story; I digress...)        This book is a jumbled cacophony of lists, adages, and "how-to" advice; all with no inherent interconnection, and limited usefulness in practical terms. I, like other reviewers, was only reading it as it was required reading for an online law enforcement course I was taking (I am a cop). Therefore I felt the need to warn those of you who are actually contemplating the voluntary reading of this book for purposes of enhancing your career.        I notice of course the flowery praise from other reviewers. This is somewhat unexplainable to me. All I can think of is that we as a people (admirably) are more likely to comment on something we feel positive about, than the opposite. And don't get me wrong, if this book helps you in some way, or you feel it has effective information to suit your needs, then by all means, I am not knocking your experience. Certainly there is SOME amount of helpful info to be gleaned here (thus the 2 stars instead of one!). It just seemed like overall, you are just being given an "information dump", with little coherence or style to speak of.        Additionally, many of the concepts and actual phrases are taken DIRECTLY from US military doctrine, as well as the actual leadership publications. At times this is appropriately noted and referenced, but other times it is not. (I spent 9 years in the Army, and some of the terms and phrases the author uses are VERY familiar, believe me!)        The real-world examples and anecdotes are few, and lackluster, and the author is quick to jump back into his ingrained style of dumping on you more maxims and formulas (some of these are so clicheed as to be almost PAINFUL to read, especially if you have read a few self-development books in the past). In the end one is left with the impression, "I could have written this book!"       Also the review would not be complete without noting the gratuitous and sometimes ghastly grammatical errors. They are all there folks: misspellings, syntax errors, usage issues, incomplete sentences, the works. I am not an English major, but come on, isn't someone supposed to review this stuff before publication? If you have read a few books in your life (not saying you need to be Einstein) you will surely find all the grammatical flaws distracting- and, admittedly, a bit disheartening from a man trying to "teach" me something.       Like I said, if you get something out of this book, my hat's off to you. Personally I found it dry, formulaic, and almost completely UN-helpful. There HAS to be better books on leadership out there! Wait... I'll recommend one right of the bat: try to get your hands on Army Field Manual 22-100, "Military Leadership". You'll find great historical examples, practical applications (to the military, though, not police work), and you may be surprised to find some of the same information as in Baker's book! (Minus all the grammatical errors though).  
 Really, there's no difference in these two books.  They both have whiny main female "heroines" who invoke ZERO sympathy!  This book was not funny, not clever, and definitely NOT worth spending money on. I just don't understand how someone will stand for being stomped all over like this and does not quit...especially after all the extra "drama" that popped up.  All she did was complain about everything...just like Andy in DWP.  I don't know which book was published first, but the authors of this one and the DWP author had the same mind.  These books read almost exactly the same: young girl gets impossible boss.  Made to do unbelievable things.     The only person I felt bad for was Grayer, the son.  Poor thing. Parents uninterested in spending time with him even though he loved them deeply.  I just don't see how a book can be humorous when this was ones of the book's main points.    I was going to use this book to see whether or not the movie would be worth viewing, but I doubt I'll go see it.  If I do, I'll be using a movie pass or someone else will foot the bill.  Pass on this one 
 This book is a huge disappointment-it leaves out 80%of the movie,and the pictures are only so-so.I don't recommend this boring book to anyone who's a die-hard Poppins fan.All kids will do is look at the pictures to cure boredom,then toss the book aside and forget about it 
 This is a great idea, however if your crib has anything larger than a Jenny Lind style piece of wood on it, it won't work.  We don't have a sleigh style crib, but the top edges were still too large for the velcro to even touch.  It would be great if they would come up with a larger size to work for the more popular/larger style cribs everyone seems to be making/buying these days 
 What can you call a woman with a Bryn Mawr education who makes fun of a 10th grade drop out from the south because he, like about half of the other people from his socio-economic background, mispronounces the word "ask" as "axe"...?   An arrogant idiot!  And one who knowingly and for profit perpetrated an indelible stain on an American tragedy, and further muddied the waters for future researchers.  And unlike contemporary audiences of this unfortunate work, the modern reader now has access to the knowledge that both McMillian and her husband have been exposed as known CIA assets and propagandists.  This book is a good way to waste 6-8 hours of your life that you can never get back, is based on what the writer knew to be bald-faced lies, and is presented in an insultingly smug manner.   This book isn't worth the matches it would take to set it on fire. 
 It's strange how so many businesspeople I meet tend to be right-wing, anti-communist and great believers in personal freedom, yet run their businesses like Stalin's Russia. Workers are motivated by a mixture of fear and ambition and any individual opinion that deviates from the party line is seen as a threat.  I'm a manager. All I ask of my staff is that they're honest, work hard and treat everyone with respect. That's it. For my part I give them a clear idea of what I expect and make sure that they have the tools to do the job and receive recognition of their achievements. What I don't do is mess with their heads.  This book is symptomatic of a trend in management culture where it is not enough to ask people to do their jobs well, we now have to re-engineer their souls. The aim of this book is to motivate staff with 'fun' activities in staff training sessions, but the reality is intrusive and patronising. One game invites workers to mention a childhood achievement that they were particularly proud of and then get other members of the team to discuss it. Well, I believe in personal freedom and part of that is not feeling obliged to talk about personal things in a work setting.  Chairman Mao had his 'Cultural Revolution' and this smacks of the same attitude. It's not enough for people to do as they're told, they now have to have the right attitude and if they're not willing to be team players, they're out. It's like 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers'.  Buy this book to find out how emotionally dysfunctional people struggle to motivate teams and get it horribly wrong.

 I have never thrown a book away before, but this doesn't deserve to be saved.  There was no plot to speak of other than a young lady that didn't like herself very much or have much confidence, and a lot of trashy dialog that most teenagers I know could have written better.  Boring, badly written, this book has nothing to recommend it 
 I heard about this book and unfortunately bought it before I could read the reviews here. I didn't know a book could be boring and over-the-top at the same time. Her descriptions of the punishments are so ludicrous and repetitive, that I found myself skipping them over. Beauty seems to have no personality or thought processes and the end is utterly confusing. All that said, I want to find out what happens in the next book! I just don't want to spend money on it! Hopefully I can find it in the library, although I doubt it 
 Dear-o-dear-o-dear! I have just had the dubious privilege of previewing this offering aimed at the pre-teens, paedophiles and tone deaf. It was like being a fly on the wall at a karaoke sleep over. I listened in disbelief as the girls slaughtered the pop classics - "Dancing Queen" may never sound the same again. It was scarey to think that these little divas had been given the benefit of "getting it right" in a studio setting. I'd hate to think what they sound like performing live. Most of the songs here make Little Jimmy Osmond singing "Long Haired Lover From Liverpool" sound quite good in comparison. Some songs are performed slightly better than others; "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" was listenable but I would still urge these little darlings not to give up the day jobs. (I hope they haven't already?) If they keep practicing some of them may go on to better things but in the meantime I can't see it myself. Perhaps this CD was somebody's idea of being cruel to them. You know... play it back to them in a few years time when they are grown up. Still, bless 'em eh? 
 A friend of mine turned me on to Spoon, and at first I listened enthusicatically... but then I got bored. Although Spoon's songs may be catchy at times, they are empty and deviod of any alterations. The same simple drum beat mixed with the same simple guitar riff may be appealing for a minute or so, but in the end I don't think I've ever listened to an entire track. If this is 5 star music today, our culture is severely lacking depth 
 This review is for the Spanish edition ONLY which I recently purchased (ISBN:8498160162, publisher: Linkgua).  Note, that this is an ABRIDGED EDITION (edición abreviada) and is not true to the original text, this is evident commencing with the first sentence of the book. The reader will get the general idea of the novel, but will not read the words as written be the author.  I submit here an example of the above-mentioned sentence:  ABRIDGED EDITION (ISBN 8498160162): A fines de octubre, don Santiago de los Santos, conocido vulgarmente con el nombre de Capitán Tiago, daba una cena, que era el tema de todas las conversaciones en Binondo, en los demás arrabales y hasta dentro de la ciudad.  ORIGINAL TEXT: A fines de octubre, don Santiago de los Santos, conocido popularmente bajo el nombre de Capitán Tiago, daba una cena, que, sin embargo de haberlo anunciado aquella tarde tan sólo, contra su costumbre, era ya el tema de todas las conversaciones en Binondo, en otros arrabales y hasta en Intramuros.  This editing is consistent throughout every paragraph in the book.   If you just want a good read, then this edition will suffice. It is an excellent novel. However, if you are an admirer of the Spanish language, please get your hands on the original version.  
 This DVD set doesn't look professional. Cheap camera work combined with ok (at best) music make this DVD a mildly entertaining 40 (x3) minutes. The sequencing is ok, each DVD starts with a visual tour of each city accompanied by music. There are maybe a total of 20 girls dancing in this DVD set (some of which are far from attractive). Some of the girls are on two different DVD's, which is kind of weird since it's supposed to be a different city on each DVD. I bought it so I could play it in the background on mute when I spin at parties, but this is not the right DVD for that. The music in this DVD doesn't match the dancing, and since the girls aren't professionals, the dancing itself is pretty awful. If you want to see girls dancing to techno music, go to a club. The last ten minutes of one of the DVDs are a lame interview with some unknown DJ, which is totally pointless 
 I found these gloves to be OK for short rides, but the stiffness of the material around the fingers made it painful.  I actually had to remove the glove from my right hand after a while because the pain was getting annoying.  Granted, these are Mtn Biking gloves, I don't understand why they would make them so stiff as to actually dig into the hand.  I've tried to break them in, but after a dozen or more rides, they are still stiff 
 This movie is utterly unremarkable -- actually, scratch that.  This movie is actually VERY remarkable -- because of how BAD it is.  First of all, the protagonist is pathetic: it's impossible for the viewer to sympathize with her because she is just a pitiful, weak person who does absolutely nothing to try and solve her problems; all she does is cry and moan.  Second, the actors are some of the most wooden and stiff performers I've seen in any movie.  Third, there are some plot gaps and questions that never get answered, which disrupt the movie's flow and continuity; for example, the protagonist gets hit head-on by an 18-wheeler truck, and her car is absolutely mangled, but she walks away without a scratch.  Someone care to explain how that's possible?  I probably would have stopped watching this piss-poor excuse for a movie if I wasn't at a friend's house (and there's the fact that it's his movie): I sat through it just to be polite.  When all is said and done, this movie just isn't worth your time.  I'm glad I'm not the one who actually paid my hard-earned dollars to buy this piece of dung 
 You don't need to trust me--you can look inside the book and get a load of the first translation of the "Frog King" which is unreadable.  Someone just took an old translation and reprinted it on poor quality paper.  This does not do justice to the tales 
 No,  class not worth of money chinees printing contants very low quality this year 
 I could not finish this book.  The writing was stilted and generally not readable to me.  The plot seemed interesting, but the writing style coupled with the unbelievability of the characters at the beginning of the book left me simply not caring about the story, or characters.  You have to have one of three things to make a book readable:  Good writing style, good characters or good plot.  This book almost had a good plot, but it was buried with poor writing and wooden characters.  I do not recommend this book 
 "I have received your new book against the human race, and thank you for it. Never was such cleverness used in the design of making us all stupid. One longs, in reading your book, to walk on all fours. But as I have lost that habit for more than sixty years, I feel unhappily the impossibility of resuming it. Nor can I embark in search of the savages of Canada, because the maladies to which I am condemned render a European surgeon necessary to me; because war is going on in those regions; and because the example of our actions has made the savages nearly as bad as ourselves." Voltaire (1755 
 As a true beginner, I had a lot of trouble understanding the concepts in the book. It did not give nearly as many examples as were necessary nor was the presentation beginner friendly. I wouldn't recommend this book... unfortunately, I don't know of a good alternative 
 While I remember listening to their previous album "Lemon of Pink" and being blown away by the  sampled instrumentation and assured flow of these surreal compositions that rivaled the organic electronic innovations of Mum, I am sad to say the new album sounds something more akin to mediocre, experimental b-listers Styrofoam (who have done some good work despite that comparison). For some reason I was under the impression that this album was a B-sides album, and I still hope it is, because if not, then I feel the majority of fans out there seriously misjudged the talent of this band, acrediting the first two albums to a drug-induced vision. This all too apparent drug induced not-so-much-of-a-vision shows it's ugly head in the format of too many overbearing, if thought provoking sound clips with not enough musical substance to back it up. Hopefully these guys will reaffirm their gifts with the next release, but I know I don't speak alone when I say that the transcendental moments of amazing electronic fusions found throughout their last two albums are all but replaced by shoddy, juvenile gimmickry that actually does feel lost, yet safe.  
 If you saw the original Broadway cast of Fosse perform, you would realize how sad this video really is. If you want to see real Fosse choreography, rent or buy one of his movies. 
 Any blurb that begins: "We think of Europe as the charming continent of windmills and gondolas..." signals a book that doesn't set its sights too high up the evolutionary tree. It's like saying "We think of America as the charming continent of cowboys and obesity". It's treating the reader like a five-year-old.  Yes, Europe has problems. But it doesn't hold the copyright on riots, minorities that can't be assimilated or no-go zones in ethnic ghettoes. If more citizens of your wonderful country actually shifted their butts out of their air-con SUVs, got passports and came to visit Europe, you wouldn't need silly, patronising books like this. And, yes, we've got windmills and gondolas, if that's what makes you happy. 
 This books seems interesting until you learn (within a few pages) that the author forbids masturbation at any time and basically sees sex as a crude animal instinct.  If you're a big Bill Bennett fan you might enjoy this, but for those inerested in developing a little more restraint while still participating to some small degree in modernity, look elsewhere.  BTW, Mr. O'Reilly, the world is NOT a more brutish place than ever before.  Sad, to say, it's almost certainly less so.  
 I will make it easy for you:   At one point the author quotes "The Rover", in particular the line "I used to rock it  sometimes I'd roll it..." and does his best to determine the evil significance of the words "rock it" and yes, "roll it".     Not even amusing in a sarcastic light but a complete waste of time and money.   In recent years Jimmy Page has become a patron of ABC Trust (Action for Brazil's Children Trust) donating his time, energy and money to help Brazilian street children so i encourage you to spend your cash wisely.     Or you can buy "Fallen Angel" and allow a self-admitted drug casualty to explain his true meaning of "rock it" and "roll it."    It's up to you of course.  
   It does not seem that Thomas Pauley is particularly rich.  One of his best success stories is getting a good loan rate so he could buy a used Mercedes that had 55,000 miles on it.   That's rich?!  It seems that if he were "rich beyond his wildest dream" he would pay cash for for any new car available and not think twice about it.  There is also a fair amount of nutty ideas like "If most of the world believed in fairies, unicorns and mermaids, you would see them running around all of time." One of the most objectionable ideas is his concept of tithing.  He makes God out to be some sort of cosmic accountant that will strike back at you is he does not get his 10%. Additionally Mr. Pauley's concept of tithing is very specific. According to Mr. Pauley giving to a church or charity is not tithing. Giving 10% to a rock star because you are inspired by his lyrics is fine (as in the case of his son).  If fact he would say that giving to poor people would be "foolish spending".  You should tith to your spiritual source. I get the distinct impression that he wants me to kick back 10% to him.   There are a few good ideas like make lists and get specific about your goals but it is never followed up by an action plan.  You should just put in your order and wait for the universe to fill it.  Mr Pauley covers himself with a hugh loophole which is, if this system didn't work for you it means that the universe didn't want you to have it.   I suggest Napolin Hill's "Think and Grow Rich"  instead.       
 I liked a couple of the songs but alot of the music sounded pretty much the same.   Trish,IL 
 Don't bother reading this one - bought it, read it, regret I wasted time and money. Forget this guy. 
 Oh, what a bitter little man is Marcus Gray.  I don't know how anyone can excuse this hate festival of a "book."  All that Gray does is make personal attacks (mostly on Joe Strummer), and claims that his purpose is to take apart the myth of the Clash.  No.  He clearly has a major bone to pick with them (especially Joe Strummer.)  I gained no new information from this book, nor was I entertained by the "author's" writing style.  The only thing that we know for sure about these four guys is that they made great music, and were human beings, no more or less flawed than any of us.  The only thing that we know for sure about Gray is that no one will write a biography about him, nor, in the spirit of this "author," will anyone, but the handful of people who may consider him a relative or friend, notice when he exits the planet.   
 It takes over half of the book to get to the plot, a criminal who passes away after telling his family that he was a war hero during WW II, and it turns out that he wasn't when the family tries for a military burial, the lead character Private Eye Kinsey Millhone is not the sharpest tack in the box, at least 60% of the writing is vivid descriptions of room decor, scenery and includes the foaming soap bubbles in a sink of dishwater, and if she mentions her underpants once she mentions them 40 times, the ending was too rushed and very unsatisfactory.  This was my first Grafton book, I may go try one of the earlier ones as I can't believe an author this popular writes this style of trivial drivel.  Skip L is for a Loser 
 Cute describes these books in the 10-mintues-a-day series.  Pleasant, a little fun, a little insipid.  But, really, not so bad just to get a taste of the language before you decide to move on to deeper study.  Actually--in contrast to more than one other reviewer--I found the word-substitution presentation to be quite helpful in anchoring the meaning of the word into my memory.  This is not an untried method, being also used in the EasyLearn Language audio programs, and other texts.  Those word stickers don't stay on too long, though.  Be prepared to lose a lot of them 
 I must begin by saying I am a fan of Gregory's and love 'The Other Boleyn Girl', 'Virgin's Lover' etc - could not put them down.    However, I did not like this book at all - and I tried very hard.  I see that I am not alone here as other people have loved her other work and disliked this one.  There was too much focus on the incest and sex - and while I completely understand that Beatrice is just a fictional character, the detail in the way she treated her brother sexually, etc was a bit much at times.  I actually preferred reading about the beautiful land she lived on.    One positive thing I will say is that Gregory really has driven her point home well on the fact that the women of Beatrice's era were very much powerless - they had no money of their own, could not inherit land even if they loved it - in fact lived and breathed it - more than their (to quote another reader) 'dimwitted brother'.  They were really quite forgotten and I have always found that truly sad - so well done to Ms Gregory for making that very important point.  She brings women to life on the pages of her books moreso than anything and you really feel for them - as much as I loathed Beatrice I felt sorry for her at the same time - she was in many ways a product of society and the way she and all women were treated.  She went mad in her desire to possess the land she so loved - but if she had the freedom that women today are lucky enough to have, she would probably have been a relatively normal woman.  A sad tale indeed.    I wouldn't recommend this one though - I'd point people towards Gregory's other work 
 I just purchased this book at a local store and I plan to return it. My interest was caught by the book's title and what it promised, but I should have read one chapter (and maybe these other reviews) before purchasing the  book. The writing seems choppy and rather overblown in its descriptions.  For example: "Standards for aesthetically pleasing proportions are  scientifically logical, achieved by following mathematical rules that date  back to the civilization and architecture of ancient Greece." Wouldn't  it have been simpler to write: "Mathematical rules established in  ancient Greek architecture are used today for creating pleasing  proportions"? Even though I was very interested in learning about  proportions, the ponderous writing style kept me from completing chapter  one. It's too bad that Ms. Stoddard did not have a good editor to guide her  in using simple English to explain what I'm sure are useful ideas 
 This book poses as a feminist text, but is really a guilty pleasure fest of stories of women cutting each other down in bathrooms and streetcorners. It portrays women in a very poor way, with the justification that "I concentrate on the bad aspects of women in competition cause that is what we need to change" Or maybe because it sells books to talk about women fighting over men, obsessing over their weights or badmouthing each other. There is no serious intellectual analysis here. Try Michael Messner for a balanced,intelligent and fun discussion of women in sport 
 John Rechy's 1963 CITY OF NIGHT was a shocker in its day, an episodic collage of metro-area male prostitution, sex, and self-destruction written in a style that echoed Jack Kerouac's beat literature.  Although dated by slang, changing mores, and the AIDS epidemic, it still bears reading today as a portrait of  gay street life in the pre-Stonewall era.  NUMBERS, Rechy's second novel, is quite another matter.  NUMBERS is essentially CITY OF NIGHT repeated, but without the "shock of the new," with less style, and with considerably less interest.  The extremely episodic story concerns Johnny Rio, a Los Angeles street hustler who several years earlier overdosed on the lifestyle and escaped to a solitary life in Arizona; now he's back "for just ten days" and, not unexpectedly, finds himself drawn back into the malestrom.  There's nothing here that Rechy hasn't said elsewhere and often quite a bit better, and NUMBERS feels much less a novel than a series of strung-together sexual fantasies lacking significant point.  In this instance, the result is less interesting than annoying; readers interested in Rechy's work should pick up a copy of CITY OF NIGHT, his first and finest work, instead.  GFT, Amazon Reviewe 
 In a society that tends to believe in creationism, Wells continues the politically correct campaign to change minds through public appeal instead of research.  Science is a slow process that requires evidence presented to academic peers for the process of a slow paradigm shift to occur.  Since ID has no evidence other than a longing from the dominant political group in the US, it is nothing more than faith.    Wells does a good job of citing numerous scientists, admitting that they are evolutionists, yet finding their disagreements with evolution.  He uses the process and characteristics of science (peer reviews and tentative conclusions) to challenge the general tenet that evolution is the fundamental process of biology.  Wells would like to win the media battle, but that has already been decided, and ID/creationism wins.  However, science is not democratic.  Evidence is required and supernatural processes do not provide the necessary information.  Wells, and other supporters of supernatural processes, will continue to get support from the general public until science education recieves proper support.  
 I am a first year Ph.D. student, and I find this book quite frustrating to read. The reading drags on and on, and I can't really remember what I read. The examples in the book are somewhat helpful, but they do not seem to fully explain the concepts very well. I hope the next edition will have a more comprehensive explanations for the concepts in the book 
 The track with BG is standard, just like the original but with an added section featuring rap by BG 
 I also have the problem of random disconnects.  We had a techie come in and try to set it up for us, he got it working, but the thing still randomly boots us off.  It does the job, I guess, of giving us a connection, but it's got almost no reliability.  I hear it's got a lifetime warranty; good, we can return it 
 Tells you what you should be doing but doesn't tell you how to do it. He explains what the quadrants are and goes in WAY too much detail describing the different types of people in these quadrants and does not tell you how to get from the employee quadrant to the investor quadrant. Makes suggestions like start a business or develop a business system. No mention on how to do that.   I just finished reading his Yahoo Finance article "A Taste for Debt" from 10/31/06 about upcoming tough financial times and he ends the article in typical Kioysaki (no explanation or in depth advice) fashion by saying "So what do I recommend? For now, enjoy the party, don't drink too much, and stay close to the exits".  Thanks for that Robert. I can't wait to not recommend and never buy one of your books again 
 I originally read this book for a class in college, but was unable to  finish it due to deadlines.  With more time on my hands, I picked up the  book recently and attempted to read through it.  I found the book had a  great deal of history, including names, dates, and facts that are difficult  to find elsewhere.  However, the book was very difficult to read due to the  style.  It was very long and monotonous and I found myself getting very  bored with it at times.  Lewis should have written with a style that  engaged the reader more since many of the interesting facts were lost in  the endlessly long discussions about each black writer.  Also, the book  included many of the writers in the Harlem Rennaissance, but it barely  talked about Harlem at all.  Many of the writers during the Harlem  Rennaissance did not even live in Harlem.  It seemed to be more of a  history about African Americans in the literary world at that time.  I  picked up the book because I wanted to read about Harlem -- not the Harlem  Rennaissance.  I wanted to read about the everyday residents of Harlem.   Overall, the book had some interesting facts, but it is a very boring read  and very difficult to sift through.  If you ever got bored reading your  history textbooks, I would not recommend this book since it is written in  the same style 
 ...the author ...described some of the recipes as possum stew (she actually uses the animals she runs down on the road) and wasp larvae appetizers.  Unless you have a taste for the extreme and you loved the menu on the Survivor Outback series, you would do well to steer clear from this one.  A good novelty item, I guess 
 What a rip off. Very little music for the money. Recycled music at that 
 I didn't find Diablo Cody's story to be funny or entertaining in the least. Her character reminds me of the girls that used to run in the local "punk rock" circle. They'd do anything for attention and cry "Look at me! Look at me!" although there was nothing special about them. Diablo seems intent on shocking the reader, but it comes off as tedious and crass. Two stars because it does provide a behind-the-scenes peek at the Twin Cities sex trade, but otherwise a boring disappointment 
 As ex-infantry I found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable. This low budget movie spoils the book. A supposed highlight is the SAS field craft, but that's a bad joke. The SAS troop crowds around for camera shots, all the while talking loudly if not shouting. Bog normal infantry don't do this never mind the best of the best, the SAS. The fire-fight sequences are passable. The interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but can't make up for the rest of it. The foul language Even if it's what they used in the field, should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot, making it unsuitable for many audiences 
 Whatever ills are in the world, it's all the fault of the corporations. That's the basic premise of this terribly misguided one-sided and totally non-objective movie. For example, instead of saying how terrible it is for companies paying people in the developing world peanuts for their work, they forget that these people's alternatives ARE EVEN WORSE and that's why they took that job in the first place!  These jobs provide them with one of the few options they have and, if they chose that job freely, it must be their BEST option, no matter how crazy it seems to us. As people's skills rise, as opportunities increase over time (by having MORE corporations and not less, to create more competition for these people's labor), and as the country becomes wealthier, these people's wages will rise automaticaly and in fact, the wages of the whole country on the average.  There are no shortcuts to his.  A famous story comes from Nepal where anti-child labor laws, at the urging of the UN, turned thousands of kids overnight into prostitutes as those jobs, as sad as it may be, were their best options to avoid starvation and feed their families.  It's a slow process, but all the industrialized nations went through that process.  Government-mandated "shortcuts" usually produce results which are even worse.  However, the results speak for themselves: in VERY short period of time, for example, HUNDRDS OF MILLIONS of people were lifted out of poverty in China, India and around the world thanks for the "evil" capalism & its corporations.  No other system has ever done it so quickly as in the past 15 years in China and India alone.  Also, cost of living is very low there, so these pennies really can go a long way, don't measure it to the cost of living in the West.  What is the filmmakers alternative they offer for these people? I guess to let people starve to death, then the makers of this movie don't have have anyting to complain about!?  Other examples of stupidity include showing that a company is like a person who's a psychopath.  A corpoartion is a legal entity yes, and may act like a separate "being" as far the law in concerned, but does a corporation have a nose, feet, stomach? Can it eat apples or sneeze or have arthritis? Of course, not, than how can you attach a human idea like a psychopath to it??  Several of the main "spokepersons" in the movie, Chomsky, Michael Moore, Rifkin and others are renowned for their off-the-wall comments which frequently have NO basis in any kind of economics or reality.  To correct the inaccuracies in the statements made by these and other people in the movie, you'd have to stop it every 5 minutes and explain to the audience how profoundly wrong the statements are.  Throughout the whole movie, you're basically bombarded by one-sided arguments with VERY little of the other side presented, despite the director's claim of the opposite 9they claim 1/2 & 1/2, it's more like 80%-20%).  Just look at Chomsky's comments about how the consumers are so stupid, they don't realize that all the things they buy they don't really need. I mean we don't need fashionable clothes (hey, let's all dress as boring as Chomsky!), DVD players, or any new gadgets that make life easier or more fun.  Who is the judge of what you REALLY need?  Chomsky, of course. He is the final arbiter of what you really need or what you don't. You're too stupid to know what you want, according to him. He says that you should do "more important things", like...perhaps studying lingistics (which he teaches but which very few care about).  The movie DOES make some correct and good observations, especially regarding polution, however, I'd say that 80% of the movie is factually and logically flawed. It's also FULL of economic fallacies. It's worth watching I guess, just to see how many errors one can make in just 1 movie.  Despite all the ranting in the movie, it fails to mention THE biggest reason of most of the problems it brings up - too much governement interference is every facet of life.  For examples, how could a Government of Brazil forbit the people of collecting rain water! How could the U.S. government do so many things for private companies with public funds?  Just forbid the governments from playing favorites with companies, forbid government corporate welfare of ANY kind, forbid subsidies to companies, cut the suffocating red tape and regulation (esp. in developing countries but in the West too), cut corporate taxes to 5 or 10% (and see unemployment rate go to almost nothing, give people all around the world a better life, increase competition, etc.)  If these and other governments (and not corporations') problems were eliminated, the vast majority of ALL the problems which the movie brings up will simply go away.  An interesing film for anyone to see how the truth can be twisted by mindless people with an agenda to go back to 15th century rural lifestile (spoken about with much admiration), people with NO understanding about economics, how the world really works and how to REALLY raise the billions out of poverty who this movie does the biggest disservice for. 
 Rod needs to take a listen to the Faces "A Nod is as good as a wink" or his own "Gasoline Alley" to remind him that he once had deep authentic soul and heartfelt grit and he was once a hard core rock n' roller. The money, success, cars, mansions, top 20 Disco hits, and the exploitation of big band which never suited his artistic abilties to begin with have crushed his rock n' roll heart. This album here is Rod does rock ala bad Vegas style meaning there's routine by the numbers uninspired spineless rock n' roll bull. Do the right thing and buy Faces "A nod is as good as a wink" to hear Rod when he was "Rod the MOD" and skip this platter of SELL OUT. CHEERS! STRATCAT (O.F. 
 "Success" is a fluffy concept. Whatever it is, the author doesn't attempt to define it. Her advice, to be "successful", you must be loyal and you must make the boss look good. There is little more substance than this. It appears to be a book format rehashing of  the author's seminars. Worse, the message is contaminated by a disturbingly noticeable undercurrent of sexism throughout. The author clearly plies a "feminist" agenda. It is emblematic that all of the quotations placed at each chapter head are those attributed to women.  I rarely have become so annoyed by a writing to want to be rid of it. Because it is so disagreeable, I could not in good conscience even give it away to anyone. I have had to return it.  I recommend more worthwhile and substantive works such as "Crucial Conversations", "Crucial Confrontations", "What Your Boss Doesn't Tell You Until It's Too Late" and "Winning Office Politics" 
 This may well be one of the worst books ever.  Totally unbelievable plot line, bad characters, bad dialog ... don't waste your time with this stinker 
 This "art tool" is basically two plastic panels that POORLY reflect an image on paper. There is nothing to this toy. Looks like the manufacturer spent a lot of effort on packaging and marketing and put NO effort into the product. Also, the name "digi" is hysterical, there is nothing digital about the product - the 2 plastic panels are inside a case that resemble a laptop. LOL! Big waste of money! You get better results tracing images the good old fashioned way when using parchment or tracing paper 
 My roomate who is devoutly Catholic has this book and I decided to read it, because to be honest, if I read all history books that I would agree with, I would find that my world was very narrow and one-sided.  Let me first start with some of the positives.  1. The book did present an orthodox perspective on many historical events in the early church.  Some of these examples include the debate over the Trinity, Divinity of Christ Gnosticism and other controversies that were prevalent during this time period.  2. His research and work on Thomas Aquinas was excellent.  His examination of the early Scholastic movement was by far the best portion of this book.  3. He does criticize those in the church who abused their positions prior to and during the time of the Reformation.  However, this was brief and will lead into some later criticisms.  4. He does actively criticize liberal Catholics who would see the church morph into something that has no basis in the Scriptures or in Church history.    Despite, these positives, there are many aspects of this book which are historically inaccurate and present an idealized picture of Church history which reflects a tendency to show a one-sides view of the Catholic Church.  In this way, he moves away from being a historian and instead becomes an Catholic Apologist in the same vein as Karl Keating and others.  Criticisms (especially concerning the Protestant Reformation):  1. His utter dismissal of Eastern Orthodox and Protestant Churches as heretical.  On page 111, he describes eastern Christianity as being a "hotbed of heresy."  It would seem that all Christian faiths outside of Roman Catholicism are untrue and without merit    2. Protestants particularly are treated with disdain.  Luther in particular is vilified as a rebel.  He quotes selectively from Luther in order to paint him as a wild and irrational human being.  While Luther's later anti-semitism is well worth being criticized or condemned, Crocker goes too far in tying Luther to Hitler and the Holocaust.  Also, he does a disservice in creating a false portrait of Erasmus as a superior theologian to Luther.  3. Along the same lines, Calvin is given some credit as being the greatest Protestant theologian, but he is ultimately dismissed as creating the first "Christian Police State."  Now, Calvin again was a man who was imperfect, but his Geneva Republic which he called an "Aristocracy bordering on Democracy" was one of the first attempts since ancient times to create a system of checks and balances and representative government that had not been terribly evident in the Middle Ages.  In the American context, it might be interesting to note that Calvinism (in its distrust of human nature) was influential in helping the American Founders to create a system of checks and balances whereby we got our Executive, Legislative and Judicial Bodies.  Also, Crocker's comparision of Calvin's view of art to the ACLU was a cheap shot that could have been omitted.  With some of these thoughts in mind, I recommend reading this book to provide a one-sided view of history.  However, I would not read this as a detailed and non-partisan account of history.  A better book that is historically more sound and would seem to be non-partisan would be "The Protestant Reformation" by Diarmaid MacCulloch is a much more unbiased look at the Reformation.    
 However it doesn't work as well as my previous one from Pavoni. The cover on the Capresso fits around the outside of the grinder so when you transfer the ground coffee to another container there is always some cleanup required. It also takes longer to get the beans finely ground. 
 I'm trying to replace my trusty 12+ year old DeLonghi that got broken accidently. This Oster 6297 is the THIRD attempt at replacing the DeLonghi. Even DeLonghi isn't the same anymore. They are Chinese made junk. This Oster looks great BUT....the thermostat is NOT accurate...cooking a Stouffers Lasagna for 52 min. @ 350 yields a COLD center of Lasagna. The outside of this oven is DANGEROUS hot. The "convection" is useless, it neither saves time nor cooks better, in fact it DRIES out the food. The ergonomics of putting food in and taking food out is dangerous...it's VERY hard to take out the trays with any kind of weight on them without skinning your knuckles on hot glass.  Stay away from this mess 
 I read the book to find a new gems of wisdom from the prophet.  It became clear that the book is full of virtues that very few would quibble with.  However, you would think that a modern prophet would give at least one quote from the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, or Pearl of Great Price. But there is not a singe one.  Upon reading the book, everyone will see that we believe in the Bible, since it is quoted every few pages. The book stands for everything Christian that everyone will agree with, and stands for nothing that is uniquely Mormon.  No mention of the restoration of the gospel, Joseph Smith, eternal families, or any of our beliefs from the plan of salvation.  More and more, we seem to downplay who we are, a part of mainstreaming which all members should objectively admit is occurring.  
 The stuff in this book might be true, but that doesn't mean I'm going to change my life just to please some man. I always have a choice and the man in my life can either accept that, or go find another woman. End of story 
 Buying and reading this book was a mistake. The author is obviously just a book writer and knows nothing about the home inspection service! That was clearly evident since I am a home inspector and there was nothing any novice inspector could learn from this book that they wouldn't already know. If you want to learn about home inspections then you have to buy a book written by an expert in that field - a home inpsector with many years of experience - not an author that writes books on random topics! There are other books that are far superior to this book. My recommendation is don't buy this, spend your money on another book 
 Darkman X. Please stop putting your sh*t out there. I'm so very sorry but i really liked his first two albums. Nowadays all i hear is the same ol sh*t.

 Two stars is an exaggeration.  I was surprised that this music did not comprise of anything which stuck with me.  It was way too unstructured for my listening pleasure.  I do not mind when musicians go into the studio/session without any preconceived ideas or even framework for the songs (LTE, Bozzio, Levin & Stevens, & Attention Deficit are all examples of pure genius for an outcome w/o having things written or rehearsed prior to).  The actual sound of the guitar almost sounds like an additional saxaphone at times.  Some of the musicianship is worthy.  Yet I am now looking to get rid of the CD I purchased (and that is saying a lot) 
 Well, nice cinematography as set-designer work: nicely interiors and well dressed actors. Maybe, visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once, but not enough to consider it as a remarkable  movie of year, as other reviewers trying to assure 
 I did not count, but it did not seem as though I read 201 answers, but fewer. In many years of working and interviewing, more lately than formerly, I encountered perhaps 3 of the questions.  In today's market, it seems interviewers are looking for evidence of directly applicable and detailed skills, especially technical and hard ones, for comfort with the candidate, for evidence of being quick, adapting well, and for initiative and solid achievement.  The questions are mildly contrived, and I have not been asked more than about 3 at any time in my longish career. Possibly because he covers so many which are illegal or too personally probing in this litigous era

 It simply scares me to think that some who read this book will believe that what it says is true. While this theory of economic imperialism isn't technically impossible, it's the kind of idea better left to an ideological blog somewhere instead of a book purporting to be a true account. Books like this make the left look as naive and stupid as Ann Coulter books make the right look bigoted and, well, stupid. This is an incredibly implausible account, and books like this, claiming to be nonfiction, undermine good writing and reporting everywhere. Shame on the author and the publisher. The only redeeming quality of this book was that it contained a list of other books published by Berrett-Koehler, the contents of which make it obvious that BK is simly a peddler of 4th rate crackpot theories, all of which appear to be of the nonfiction variety. 
 THIS BOOK IS FULL OF $%#*, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! I'VE CALLED MANY OF THE NUMBERS AND THEY NO LONGER EXIST. THIS BOOK IS A FRAUD AND A WAST OF TIME. ""I HATE THIS BOOK 
 The big problem with this book is its misleading title:"Ancient Palestine: A Historical Introduction". Do you think you might get some history? Nay not so.  This is merely 50+ pages of discussion explaining how difficult it is to get a true picture of ancient history.  Good only for sending to a hard shell fundementalist who firmly believes every word in the Bible is gospiel truth.  Lots of references to where the bible can't be historical accurate.  Following what would be an introduction in a normal book, there is a page or two of one line chronological listings of historical periods.  Thats it.  If you think you are going to get a summary of Palestine History - you will be as shocked and disappointed as I was 
 As is sometimes the case, the title of this book is somewhat misleading.  Having read several books which were generally favorable to Greenspan I thought this one might give a balance counter view.  Overall, it turned out to quite a disappointment.  In the first few pages Professor Batra made it clear that he thinks he is probably more qualified to be the Fed Chairman than Greenspan.  On page 1 he says "He had not done any path-breaking work in economics, at least not that was commonly cited."  On page 3 he says "It could explain how he had advanced so far without sufficient credentials; how his extraordinary career appeared to derive crucially not from merit but from favoritism and connections".  Also on page 3 -"Greenspan did not even have a Ph.D. at the time; nor had he penned anything pioneering to earn the recognition of his peers".  On page 7 I again knew the book was in trouble when Batra stated "...because in my view intelligence and integrity go together".  Does anyone actually believe that all dishonest people are dumb?  On page 9 Batra made it clear that the book was as much, or more, about his economic philosophy than it was about Greenspan when he wrote "In fact, I will offer a new economic paradigm to cure the global stagnation that has resulted from tax trade, and monetary policies inspired by Greenspan".  He does offer a paradigm; unfortunately, real world experience shows that the paradigm does not to work as he postulates.  Clearly, the book is attempting to put forth his agenda.  As the rest of the book demonstrates, Professor Batra is a fairly strong liberal in whose world the working poor will spend all additional income and the idle rich will simply put extra income under their mattress.  He regularly harps on reducing income taxes on the "poor" and increasing them on the "rich" and "big businesses".  As recently as 2003, the Congressional Budget Office documented that the bottom 40% to 50% of the population pay little or no taxes while the upper income individuals and businesses pay the vast majority.  How the government could reduce the taxes on people who do not pay taxes is never addressed.  Professor Batra does correctly point out that the Social Security tax is quite regressive.  In order to discredit Greenspan, Batra gives Greenspan gives Greenspan far more power than is warranted.  Throughout the book, Batra tries to convince us that the President and Congress did whatever Greenspan might suggest or support.  As written, the book makes one believe that Batra never watched Greenspan testify before Congress where the congressmen tried to get Greenspan to support their way of thinking.  Basically, Batra tries to blame Greenspan for all of the acts of Congress.  Batra's new paradigm he calls Economic Democracy.  In this Economic Democracy the Federal Government would buy most of the stock of the large companies and then give it, or sell it at a big discount, to the employees of the companies.  That way the employees would be in control rather than the CEOs and boards of directors.  Clearly, Professor Batra is not living in the real world.  In the real world most of the employees who were given the stock would simply sell it in fairly quick order and that, of course, would return things to where they originally were.  For many years I was an "employee owner" of the nations largest totally employee owned company and I can attest that they do not operate in any way close to what Professor Batra assumes.  The good professor needs to get out his ivory tower and get a job in the real world.  If you want to learn about Greenspan, this is NOT the book to read.  Save your money. 
 Unreal. Short term fasts are more realistic. Unless you're loaded with money and time to take 10+ days of vacation, you can't realistically do this, not in a job that deals with the public. Still, it's all talk, common sense -stop shoveling food in your face and get off your couch and exercise. There's no scientific data, no detailed info on how to fast effectively. The chapters are terribly repetitive and end in a promotion for juice machines. I am returning this book for a refund or exchange. I find nothing worth revisiting in this book 
 I tend to agree with all of the above reviews regarding this book. I am attempting to read this book at present and find it very difficult to understand how the different test models apply in the real world. I use to test setup for a major computer company. I am guessing that Chapter 8, Syntax Testing, or Chapter 9, Finite-State Testing, would apply. But I need more than the brief introductory paragraphs to know which one applies: Ch 8 - "Syntax testing is a powerful technique for testing command-driven software and similar applications. It is easy to do and is supported by commercial tools". vs Ch 9 - "Originally motivated by hardware logic testing, the finite-state machine model is an excellent model for testing menu-driven applications." The material in the chapters is thorough but dry. 
 This type of music is like a blister on the brain.  You can't get rid of it and it is irritating.  Yes, this is the problem with most FM radio when this CD from 4 years ago is still getting played.  And the tune to "This Love" is beyond annoying as he pauses between each word.  Moron 5 rank up there with Gwen Stefani and Black Eyes Peas for most annoying, successful artists

 Wheeler has only one premise: plot everything on an XmR chart and watch for outliers or trends.  The entire book has very little other technical suggestions for data analysis.  Wheeler's mathematical detail is extremely weak.  For example, he doesn't show where any of the multiplicative factors come from nor does he give references.  The same depth of knowledge can be gained in 10 minutes with a Google search 
 The 2nd edition of this book is terrible. Look it up and see what other people have said about it. Be sure you can flip through this edition before buying it. Also, look at the author's website and prepare for the shock of your life (he writes a book about a subject he knows next to nothing about) 
 I have tried many pilates DVD's with and without props and this one is not worth paying or doing.  The instruction is ok, quality of video is good BUT the workout itself is 40 minutes of nothing really... very disappointing! 
 I took Dr. Mount's class at the U. or Arizona, and he's a really smart guy, but the man can't explain anything. It's not just his book either; his lectures are just as cryptic. I went to class thinking I understood the concepts, but then I got totally confused when he lectured. I would try to clarify things with the book, and again, I'd get even more confused. Someone who reviewed this book earlier said that he tends to use 10 words where he should use 1; I couldn't agree more. The figures in this book also need a major overhaul, and he should definitely include more examples of the many complex concepts he talks about. While I have no doubt that there is plenty of useful information in there, getting anything out of it is a chore. I would only recommend this book to someone who already had a strong knowledge of bioinformatics concepts 
 The main problem with Domesticating History is that it claims to show that the historic houses "reflect less the lives and times of their famous inhabitants than the political pressures of the eras during whih they transformed in museums" -- but then barely discusses the museums themselves and the messages they conveyed.  We get a lot of detail about the other political efforts of the people who tried to found these museums, but we have no way of knowing to what extent those other political beliefs manifested themselves in what visitors saw, because we never really learn *what* they saw.  That many of the organizations that sprouted up to restore and maintain these homes had deep ideological divisions makes this omission even more glaring, because the reader has no way of knowing which agenda, if any, eventually won out.  There is interesting and informative material here, but what argument there is, is poorly presented 
 I hated this book.  I thought it would be funny, and I wanted to read something that wasn't the typical.... but the author's take on everything is so negative that I couldn't stand to read it.  She indicates you're doomed to get fat, your doomed to be uncomfortable, you're doomed to have an idiot spouse/partner, etc.  People like this author give pregnancy a bad name.  Yes, it has its moments of being uncomfortable, icky, etc., and if you choose to focus on all that, like this author does, you'll also be miserable.  I chose not to be 
 Sugrue's thesis in this book is that endemic racism (along with economic decline) is responsible for Detroit being largely Black, poor and greatly in decline.  He's a revisionist historian who wants to refute older narratives that Detroit is corrupt (because all the city governments after 1967 have been run by Democrats and Blacks).  Instead he attempts to refute that by showing the deeply ingrained racism in the community.  Sugrue's attempt at political polemics is bad history.  He fails to mention the obvious: Detroit is over-taxed and run by incompetent, corrupt politicians.  It's public unions have caused government workers to be some of the highest paid in the country with little to show for it.  This is thanks to former-Mayor Young who instituted an arbitration law.  To pay for this, the city's taxes are exorbitant which pushes businesses further out.  Because of this, Detroit never found other businesses to take the place of the declining auto-industry which has inflated pay for its jobs in the first place.  Of the past three mayors, two have been highly corrupt.  Archer who was mayor in the '90s, after a distinguished career in the state Supreme Court, tried to reform the city but was kicked out of office.  Young and the current mayor, Kilpatrick, are very corrupt.  Just do a google news search of "Kwame Kilpatrick" and "corrupt" and you'll see the various scandals that have plagued him.  Other than stealing city funds for himself and his family he turned down a $200,000,000 private gift to the city for charter schools because the teacher's unions were against it.  Young, mayor in the '70s and '80s, made room for a GM plant by confiscating private land through eminent domain.  Few could understand why he buldozed tax producing land when he could have given over acres of abandoned property, except that the residents of that neighborhood voted overwhelmingly against him.  Yes, white people with means fled Detroit for the suburbs.  But Sugrue glosses over that fact that middle class Black residents left as soon as the could too.  Southfield, a surburb township, is overwhelming Black and middle class, populated by those who couldn't stand the crime and corruption of Detroit.  Far from being an example of a typical post-industrial American City, Detroit is the exception.  It should be held up as a prime example of how not to run a city.  That being said, unless you've been assigned this book, don't read it.  Sugrue gives excuses and vague general reasons (aka racism) for Detroit's decline when the real problems are staring him in the fac 
 I read this book with high hopes, as it seems to have been highly regarded by many who have dealt with autism.  However, I was quite disappointed by it, on several levels.  The depiction of Daniel's autism is very textbook---I got very little sense of him as an actual little boy.  He followed the book on autism too exactly---right down to obsession with Thomas the Tank Engine.  The methods that helped him, which although this isn't spelled out seemed to be a modified form of Floor Time, were not really convincing to me.  This book failed most for me as a novel, though, not as an autism portrait.  The characters never came to live for me in any way.  Melanie's estranged husband, Stephen, comes across as such a cold fish that it's impossible to understand why anyone would have fallen in love with him in the first place.  Andy is such a stereotype of the rural, uneducated natural angel that I can't buy it at all.  A few characters are thrown in for reasons I can't totally fathom---what purpose do Larry or Veena serve?  However, I did keep reading until the end, and I had mild interest in the outcome.  I am glad autism is finding its way into popular literature, but I hope it can be written about in a more skilled matter in the future 
 In Refuse To Choose, Barbara Sher badly confuses two very real but very different problems: the inability of some people to finish any project they start, and the shame dumped by family and friends on people who pursue many diverse passions in life.  The book rightly dismisses that misguided shame thrust on people with ecclectic interests, and in doing so may be very helpful and encouraging to an otherwise successful person who meets that description.   But for people who are unable to bring any project to completion, the book offers little useful advice, and several suggestions that are likely to make the problem worse instead of better.  Instead of explaining how to complete projects and escape from the traps that prevent them from being completed, the opening chapters dismiss the value of completing any project we start - an assertion even this book can't support for very long.  In the closing chapters of the book, Sher gives exactly the same advice that anyone else would: pick one project and see it through to the finish, ignoring all others.  And that's a reasonable suggestion, but it leaves most readers right back where they started.   In one particularly ill-conceived passage, Sher encourages overwhelmed parents to set aside parental responsibilities in favor of other priorities; she gives the example of feeding the kids cereal for dinner instead of going through another day's shopping routine, and asking the children to help out with an important business report instead of working on it privately.  On the surface, this sounds reasonable: why let drudgery sap away any more creative energy?  But a deeply misguided philosophy of parental and personal responsibility lies underneath this type of suggestion.  The children in this scenario learn that it is their responsibility to solve the parent's problems, and they also learn that eating properly and other such "adult" behaviors are ultimately unnecessary.  The parent in this scenario learns that the sound parental decision-making is unimportant - and then the parent wonders why the adolescent child shows no ability to make good decisions.  There are good ways for a parent to maintain a reserve of creative energy, but this ain't one of them.   Some of the ideas in the book are useful.  It is indeed a good idea to put aside others' negative judgments of our many exciting projects, and to find encouragement by making lists of past accomplishments, and to keep a journal of creative ideas, and to occasionally abandon a project with the same enthusiasm with which it was launched.  But these are not new ideas: Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way covers the same territory with much greater insight and wisdom.  If you're looking to free yourself from your inability to complete any projects you start, get The Artist's Way, follow its program, and find out what the real problem is.  And keep pursuing your many interests - but do it to satisfy your deepest desires, not to distract yourself from them 
 If the Kranks really did what they set out to do and skip Christmas, that would have been a good story.  The end.   Instead, they end up having to scramble to try & make Christmas "happen" for their daughter unexpectedly coming home.  In other words - a typical stressful material holiday, instead of a celebration of friends, family, or even, gasp! Christ's birth.  I agree - if you don't want to celebrate Christ's birth, if you don't want presents and holiday decorations and family time - skip it.  Why torture yourself?    It would have been a good story if they did this.  Instead, the plot deteriorated into a very stupid, ridiculous and unrealistic dash to the finish line of "making Christmas happen."    A completely unsatisfying and unfunny read.  Threw it away so others wouldn't have the displeasure of reading it 
 There are not many books that I read that I find boring, but unfortunately this was one of them.  I was especially dissapointed after all the glowing reviews saying how funny this book was supposed to be. I found it very repetitive and dull. I also agree with other reviewers who wonder what the whole side-story about the tractor book was for. Those readings from the father's history book were especially boring.  It also took me more than a week to finally finish this since I just couldn't get into it. It was just silly episodes about the eccentric father and greedy, but supposedly, stunningly-beautiful Valentina over and over.  The author tried to delve a little into the history of why the sister was the way she was and about the horrors of war but then left us with no clear ideas about what she thought about these topics. We also never quite know whether Valentina is a good or bad person. Luckily I didn't pay much for this because I bought it second-hand from Ebay.  I wish I'd gotton it out of the library instead. Not worth the time it takes to read since there are much better books out there.  I learned nothing from this book and can't even say I entertained by it either.   
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 I ordered the Journal about a year ago and received 2 issues, and  never received another issue.  I contacted customer service about the problem, used the problem  report forms(or whatever it's called) and NEVER heard from them again.  I get this email today telling me to renew my subscription...  (after I had almost forgotten about the whole incident)    What nerve!!! I remember when I bought this a year ago, another person had written a review warning people that she had not received her subscription.  Back then I just thought this would never happen to me..  (the same thing happened with Vogue magazine)  Boy was I wrong.  The 2 issues that I did receive were pretty good though.  I buy tons of stuff from Amazon but I would highly recommend getting  this from another vendor or ebay(they're usally cheaper too)  
 I thought I was getting a good deal and a good product at a cheap price, but instead I got what a paid for and nothing more.  Cheap product at a cheap price.  Only used a few times, literally 2-3 times, then one time when my girlfriend put the glass down on the table it broke and wine went everywhere.  Luckily we acted quickly or else a bunch of carpet would have been ruined.  They feel really cheap too.  If you only want to use them a few times, get them, I know we will never get these again 
 I'll start with the positive:  The main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall, good-looking, smart, humble, etc.  The story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words.  In short, it was a competent work of fiction.   That's where my praise ends, because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas.  Sure, it's a work of fiction, no one is going to take it seriously, yada yada yada.  But that's not true, is it?  So many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers.  Alright, here are my problems with it:  First, politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power, but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state.  In Term Limits, Vince Flynn just beats you over the head with the "power corrupts" mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song, yet from the lips of the Marine Combat Veteran Congressman who is our protagonist.  You know what, though?  There are people in politics on BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE who really want to do what's right, who really are trying to make a difference for the positive, for this nation and the citizens.  In this book, however, the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough to make good decisions.  Second, murder is a viable answer.  This repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land.  Come on, get real.  This book touts a Special Forces Unit as being so committed to the Constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn't balance the budget.  And, they get away with it because it's really the right side to be on.  Murdering our leaders is the answer according to Vince Flynn.  Murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation, that being elections.  Elections apparently just get in the way.  Third, the balanced budget.  For years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget.  The book makes it the central theme.  Balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible.  It's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel.  A Coup!!!  Yet, when the conservatives did take power, despite Vince Flynn's prescient forecasting ability, they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn't flinch.  Even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility, they claim that NOW!!!!! the deficit isn't a big deal, that it's really just a function of the percentage of GDP and we ought to all forget about it.  This book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later.  It's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits.  Fourth, the good guys don't do bad things.  The Special Ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians.  The bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool.  Flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous, though shalt not?  - CV Ric 
 I hate to be yet another naysayer here, but seriously....what is all the hype about these books? My poor sister (who for some reason loved them) told me to read them, and I struggled for WEEKS to finish the first book in the series. Normally, a book of Eragon's size and reading level would be devoured by me in less that a day or two. However, upon reading the first chapter, I was struck almost immediately by the choppy sentence structure. Almost all the sentence were the same length. It was hard for me to read more than a chapter at a time because passages simply did not flow well at all.   When I finally finished Eragon, I thought that the second one had to be better, since it got published. I was dead wrong. Both books had an incredibly boring story, derivative plot, unoriginal characters and setting (also names stolen almost directly from Tolkien!!  ), pedestrian language and writing style, wooden dialogue (every character spoke with the same exact "voice," none were really distinct from each other), and cliched expression after cliched expression. In Eragon at least, the entire book was full of passages of "purple prose." Worst of all, the author only TOLD and hardly ever SHOWED the reader what the characters were feeling. Speaking of characters, Eragon sorely lacked both character description (I didn't even know what Murtagh was supposed to look like or how old he was until the book was almost over), and there was almost no character development whatsoever. I felt no emotional involvement and didn't care a thing for almost any of the characters. Making the reader care about their characters is one of the most important things authors must do to create a meaningful story with emotional depth. For instance, if George R. R. Martin can make me learn to love a traitorous villain who commits incest with his sister, then why can't I care about the "perfect" titular HERO of these books???    Believe me, I gave this series many chances to impress....and it failed. I love the idea of Dragon Riders (a la the Pern series) and I thought the character of Saphira had some good things about her. Being a linguist, I love the idea of language having a deep, abiding power of its own (which has also been done a la Tolkien and Le Guinn), but the things in this story just felt like a boy's fantasy daydream, down to the sexy elf chick in tight leather of all things.  Just because someone is young and writes a novel does not make said novel good nor does it make said novelist a prodigy. I truly think that the only reason either of these books were published in the first place is because Paolini's parents were the ones who published them.   My apologies if my rant offends anyone, I'm just a little upset that I spent so long plodding through this only to find that it did not improve. Normally when I read a book, I can tell its good because of the shivers of excitement I feel while devouring page after page. That quality is the main thing that was missing from Paolini's works. I truly hope he has a chance to improve his writing over time.  
 This movie lives up to it's horrible reviews! It's not really bad enough to be called "So bad it's good" and not good enough to be considered a good movie. Yeah, it's bad but it's not a cool or funny type of bad. The script is based on a book and though lots of people claim the book is great if it's anything like the movie I probably won't read it! The story is totally cliche and unoriginal: Earth is in ruins and taken over by aliens and a group of humans must save themselves from extinction, slavery etc, etc. The dialogue is weird, the pace of the movie is weird and the ending is very predictable. Combine a bad story, lousy acting, bad costumes, low quality special effects and bad camera work and you have this cheese-fest of a movie. Travolta is the bad guy in this movie and it's really easy to hate him, perhaps a little too easy! He calls humans "Rat Brain" but I think the word is better suited to him! Travolta is really bloated in the face and I don't think it's the costume or makeup. What ever happened to getting in shape for a role? He's an average actor and this character did nothing to bring out his good qualities. On the plus side there is a lot of shooting and explosions in the movie so if you're into that you might like this movie. I thought it was a stinker and will not watch it again! 
 I definitely wouldn't know Sony made this. It's crap. I put it down on a table, it shuts it's self off, it refuses to play some regular (store bought) CDs (no scratches). It eats batteries. It's very, very loud when it does decide to play a CD. I am very disappointed. I was better off keep my 3 year old Pannasonic, it has better rumble control and plays all my CDs 
 are the words that describe this book.  I am studying for a test right now and I can't bear to read even one more page.  I'm not just saying this because its a school book and school is boring...this book is really excruciatingly repetitive and horribly worded.  I gotta read alot of the stuff multiple times just to understand what this [guy] is trying to say.  He could have simplified the book so it's half the length that it is.  Ravi Sethi, the author, sounds like a [conceited person] who thinks he's so smart...He should be fined for writing this book and making poor college students like me read it.  This book is causing me much mental anguish 
 I loved the fact that you can program your fitness segments, but this tape should be labeled just for beginners.  The toning segments didn't fatigue my muscles, and the cardio I barely broke a sweat. If you are a beginner, this is a great video to start with.  They only do 6 reps for weights most of the time and the cardio is not too hard to follow, or too hard to do.   In all 5 stars for beginners, 2 stars for intermediate/advanced. 
 By my good fortune I happen to have had the pleasure of  working with Master Kwan, However briefly, in Boston last winter. Drawn to him by "The Wandering Taoist" I happened upon him in the Boston public garden, Teaching. After a couple of months, working together with his students and speaking with them about their experiences with him, I heard a few things that could be of use to the validity of Deng Ming-Dao's work. It turns out that when I once questioned Master Kwan's main student (of ten years) about Deng Ming-Dao's work, he said that he had met Deng Ming-Dao and was present while he was being tought. that said Master Kwan's student then stated that Ming-Dao was a  western man who had asked Master Kwan if he could write a book about him. Master Kwan agreed an told Ming-Dao a few stories and such. Afterwards Mister Ming-Dao proceeded to say that he had no further use for Master Kwan, and left.  To this day Master Kwan has never read any of the material published about him, nor has he recieved any kind of royalties from Mister Ming-Dao. That said, it must be understood that Master Kwan wouldn't trouble over such things as royalties, he leads a very humble life, but his students do find it frustrating. If you would like to see Mater Kwan for who he really is, I invite you to visit the site that I stumbled upon last winter at; www.easternheathpractices.org. I hate to slander anyone over such things but I feel very strongly about this. Thanks for your time and patience 
 A very very dangerous book reminicient of the McCarythite past of this country where decent people whose views clashed with the right-wing bullies; were lynched and intimidated in public discourse.  There should be a huge outcry against books such as these whose merits are dubious and whose sole motivation is political smear and revenge.  Typical of a neoconservative icon like the pro-Israeli Horowitz whose fellow neocon warmongerers scared the American people into the invasion of Iraq and now dangerously Iran...  American better wake up and smell the fifth column of neocons amongst us. One of their trademark traits is their consistent reliant on fear and shameful exploitation of world terrorism to further their agenda for Israel, a country they'd die before they criticize.   It is precisely in that motivation that honest academians are being crucified in his hatefest Horowitz calls a book.   As is always the case, its best to question and do some digging about the source that smears before you latch onto his fears.    It then goes into length about history of the Democratic Party and how it has nothing, nada good to offer. A fact which is interesting considering the author's own lovefest with the Party when he was a 60's hippie.   If Horowitz seems content in bashing his own roots so be it because that in a nutshell is what this book is about, exposing what Mr. Horowitz's considers his own shameful past.  Highly recommended for the easily brainwashed amongst us 
 It's a good thing I watched the movie before reading  the book or else I wouldn't have known what the heck was going. I was stranded at a bus station in Philly and "Beloved" was the only book I had to read to pass away the time. Dull, dull, dull. Torture, torture, toture. I had to re-read each page more than once just to understand what was happening. This book is too long, too boring, and extremely overhyped. It leaves you braindead. I enjoyed "The Bluest Eye" more than this. Skip this book at all costs and watch the movie instead. The movie's just as boring and confusing, but it's visual and last only 2 hours and 52 mintues, which is less time than a week of reading 
 According to evidence, astronomy in India, China, and several other cultures developed independently. Indian astronomy wasn't influenced by Greek astronomy until Alexander came to the area. Chinese astronomy has at least an 8,000-year history; later developments suggest collaboration with Iranian cultures, but the oldest stuff is homegrown. So how did this writer determine that this astronomy came from the same source? Where is the archeological and literary provenance?  There isn't any. You have to accept on faith that this person is telling the truth. They aren't, and they didn't check to see whether any of the nonsense they spouted had any relation to evidence 
 I found this book extremely boring. I forced myself to read the whole thing because I'm a San Franciscan, but I didn't even feel it captured the city well. I kept turning back to remember who characters were, and as far as the plot...uh...did something happen? The cover is the best thing about this book 
 I have enjoyed all the Cat Who Books . Have owned or borrowed or went to library to read them. Always can't wait for the next book to see what Koko and Yum Yum are up to. Have two of my own and think they are smart things to have 
 Interested as I am in the subject matter, I was very disappointed in this book.  It would be better labeled "Meditations of Malinche," as the book is overly heavy in giving us the interior thoughts of this historical figure.  And these hemorrhage in rhetorical questions.  What I most missed was that the novel failed to make the larger than life characters and events of this period of Mexican history come alive in three, palpitating dimensions.  The language often turns lyrical, poetic, symbolical and/or abstract, removing me from the events narrated instead of immersing me in them 
 As a woman interested in the art and science of Ayurveda I was of course drawn to this book.  It is a very informative and helpful book but the tone of Svoboda's writing is very condescending.  In the beginning the author appears to have great respect for women and the fact that they are the givers of life.  But in every other paragraph to follow the doctor seems to make a point to talk down to the reader.  It's hilarious actually.  I wish I had the book in front of me to quote from.  He even goes so far as to instruct mothers in how to raise their children.  I don't know if this doctor is even a parent.  He makes no mention of his own experience in this area.  The amount of effort and energy that goes into creating and then raising up human beings is enormous and deserves respect and appreciation, which Svoboda for some reason is unable to offer to his readers.  This book does little to truly support women of any age group now that I really think about it.  Women need compassion, not simply facts and a "talking to" about how they should be doing better.  So for all those who wish to read this book, you will find clearly presented valuable information about how Ayurveda relates to womenkind.  But getting past Dr. Svoboda's holier-than-though tone is like scraping a heavy layer of ama off the tongue 
 irish how are ya, only been in ireland once. reviewed by the horse doctor, anyone want to buy a three legged dressage horse 
 You charge too much for shipping and handling. I would have been better off going to a Retail Store 
 I've never written a review before. I love the Repairman Jack novels, but this was a waste of time. I'm glad it wasn't more than $0.50. Apparently, "electronic edition" means "no editor involved." For example, on page 3, Jack checks his appearance: "NY Jets warm up Jacket over a flannel shirt, worn jeans over tan, steel-toed work boots."  Only a page later, "Jack found himself on the move before he knew it, his sneakers whispering along the pavement." I guess I missed the part where he changed his shoes.  Beyond this and other distracting errors, there was really no story. I usually enjoy Repairman Jack because there's plenty of exposition of the secondary characters' motivation, and Wilson really ratchets up the tension in his novels. None of that is here, and I don't think that's because it's a short story. This whole thing feels slapped together.  Fianlly, I'm also disappointed because I think this plot (Jack being arrested) is worthy of being part of a longer novel 
 Reading this novel was slow going.  As a guy, I found the lack of action stultifying, and the flashes of humor were too quaint for me to derive any pleasure from them.  The answer to the book's primary riddle--who shall Emma marry?--becomes obvious early on, and everything else is just a tedious pairing off until that riddle is expressly answered.  There's a bit of local and historical color, but rarely does the narrative rise above the description of, say, a summer outing.  Not one of Jane Austen's best 
 By "it" I mean the evil monster called "Repetition". It may sound like a strange thing to say, but if you already own Doyle's "Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire", there's absolutely no reason whatsoever to buy this soundtrack.   The film feels like you've seen it a thousand times already, and so does the score. I can't stress enough how much I dislike the habit of many composers to develop a specific sound and a certain set of themes and motifs, and ride them out until the end of days. That being said, it's not a big reach saying that Goblet Of Fire and Eragon sound exactly the same. And they do. The orchestrations couldn't be more identical, and the theme is the same, even if Doyle adds a few flourishes.  It may fit the film somehow, but if you forget that for a second and evaluate the music as an entry in the long history book of film music, or even in the not-so-long book of the last few years, or worse, as a standalone piece, it's just a horrible product, it's Patrick Doyle on autopilot. And even if it does fit the film, there's more to a great film score than capturing a scene reasonably well. A great film score gives the film a unique feeling, and Eragon doesn't do that. Instead of writing an "Eragon" score, Doyle churned out a Patrick Doyle score. Sound crazy, but that's the big difference between good film composers and great film composers.  And contrary to the opinion of many, Doyle is merely a good composer, and so we get a Doyle score with Eragon fingerprints instead of Eragon music with Patrick Doyle fingerprints.  
 I unfortunately could not get through this book. T.R just went on and on, getting a bit carried away with his own wit and literary skills. I wish  I could write a better review, but I can't get past the second chapter. Perhaps further on down the road I will give it another try. In the meantime I recommend all Tom's other novels. 
 While I have all of Ina's previous cookbooks and use them frequently, this is a cookbook that I can't say I've made much use of at all.  The recipes don't have as much appeal to me as the recipes from her prior books.  They seem a bit fussier to make (in keeping with French cooking, no doubt), but not only that, the food itself simply doesn't seem as appetizing.  I realize this is simply a matter of taste, but had I actually spent the money to purchase this book (I received it as a gift), I would have been extremely disappointed.  Perhaps my day to day life doesn't call for recipes such as Bouef Bourguignon and Filet of Beef au Poivre.  And as charming as Ina can be, reading the personal details of her idyllic life with Jeffrey in France does get just a tad bit nauseating...I would highly recommend sticking to food, and particularly the food that Ina made so popular in the Hamptons.   
  McKenzie offers a fun and popularized account of the life of David.  However, the text he produces, far from being scholarly, often reads a bit like a tabloid account of King David.  Deconstructing the book of Samuel, a Herculean and important task, has been accomplished elsewhere by serious scholars who offer very deep reconstructions of this most fascinating and contradictory character.  Readers looking to explore the subject would do well to look for Professor B. Halpern's seminal work, "David's Secret Demons."  While not as breezy in style, the book goes far deeper in uncovering its subject and will offer the reader far more food for thought.  Therefore, if looking for an easy read, pick up McKenzie, but those with a serious interest in King David should put the time and effort into a more serious work.  Please, take a look at Halpern; you won't regret it.  
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 While some of the topics Johnson brings up such as the mixing of cultures that takes place during this time, she lacks the organizational skills and talent as a writer to make the book compelling.  Her work is all over the place and it's hard to follow especially when trying to use it as the basis of a research paper (which is what I had to do for a upper division history class of mine) 
 Besides the politically focused lyrics the beats, rhythms, synths, horns etc....feel luke warm and familiar. There is not a single track on here that sounds like an anthem. The songs start at a mid level tempo and stay there for the duration of the track.    UB40's earlier works were most noteworthy for a song to go through multiple phases of progression, leading to dynamite "crescendo's" featuring synth solos or horn solos, choruses that made you want to sing! In terms of production UB40's earlier works are a goldmine of multidimensional richly layered tunes.   The production is totally lacking on this album.  On this album you will find the simple "one" "two" "one" "two" piano rhythm (on almost every track!), coupled with very basic(bland) & repetitive bass rhythms. The Sax is here, though it never shines.   Though if you are a fan of UB40's more toned down late 90's to present sound, this album probably will not dissapoint you. Because even though the songs on this album are not bad, they just are not that good.   Furthermore, in light of this album being toted as UB40 "getting back to its roots"....do not be fooled.      Simply put this album lacks the energy of their earlier works.    If you are interested in UB40 check out the following albums for some of the best Reggae period. Listed in order from heavy dub influence to more progressive/cross genre influenced works; 1980-1983, Present Arms, Signing Off, Geofrey Morgan, Labour of Love, Labour of Love II.   Thanks!

 This book is littered with very poor grammar, layout and typesetting from cover to cover making it a difficult and painful read for a technical book. The enclosed CD rom comprises a heap of code, very poorly formatted (and expressed) lecture notes and unrelated information. This book is also very mathematical and as such would not be recommended to a novice 
 I almost put the book down after a 100 pages as I couldn't figure out what it was about or where it was going. The ending was equally bad, the book just goes no where besides talking about anti establishment type themes. Horrible. 
 Being a huge fan of the original, this was a waste of production money.  If one was to remake The Music Man, one would think the remake would be so totally different than the original there would be no room to compare.  Robin Williams would have been great in that respect! Matthew Broderick was a cardboard cutout with limited emotion and no dancing ability.  Why he keeps getting roles like this is beyond me 
 Very sorry I wasted the money on this book as well as her others!  ;- 
 Amnesty inspired.  Full of baseless rumors that cannot be documented.  Very anti Han, and racist.  
 Neoliberalism was born on September 11, 1973, when a US-backed military coup murdered the democratically elected President of Chile and ushered in the tyranny of General Pinochet who murdered and tortured thousands, closed parliament, and outlawed political parties and trade unions.  If that doesn't give you pause about the compatibility of neoliberalism and democracy, read this book.    In Hayek's model of an ideal constitution each citizen is given one vote per lifetime when they reach the age of 45 (page 113).  Then, Hayek decides that's probably too generous, and calls for an "indirect method of election" where the legislature would appoint regional delegates who would appoint new legislators, without any popular vote at all (page 114).    Neoliberals hate democracy, in both theory and practice, and are much more comfortable with an oligarchy 
 As much fun as sitting in your accountant's office with your lap full of tax receipts. Of course, there are worse things in life, but please, remind me of what they are. Better yet, don't remind me! 
 Thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story.  We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.  John Grisham cheats us out of that fun.  The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings?  That's bad.  Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules 
 I really wanted to like this CD. I tried, I really did. But in the end, it never got above generic rock for me. Yes, it does rock pretty hard at times, but the main thing I couldn't get past was the pretentiousness of the lyrics. Enough of the heavy-handed Biblical imagery already, Barbara! Leave that sort of thing to Dylan...he knows what to do with it. (In fact, they end this CD with a cover of Bob's "Highway 61 Revisited," and don't do the song any favors.) And while Barbara Keith has power in her voice, I don't hear much soul. Take a listen to Neko Case to hear the difference between a belter and a singer who can mix a strong voice with subtlety.  Musically, the CD is full of pretty straightforward rock riffs, a bit along the lines of Joan Jett without the growl and later ZZ Top. They're basically a competent bar band that needs to lay off the sophomoric "poetry," and honestly, I'm a bit baffled by the overwhelming response this CD has gotten here in the Amazon reviews. I guess this might sound good compared to a lot of what you hear on mainstream radio and MTV (when they play videos) these days -- that is, you'd have to not have been doing much exploring outside the mainstream over the past decade or so. To each their own, in any case, but the lyrics of these songs make me cringe. I need it played with more freewheeling spirit, more heart, more soul, and a little more creativity. A bit of a sense of humor wouldn't kill them either, for that matter 
 Original time window too long.  Book never received.  Told to wait two weeks longer.  Still no book.  Had to buy it elsewhere for reading group.  Book is excellent.  A1book service poor 
 I rank this book slightly higher than Season of the Machete, simply because I only got to page 25 of that book before giving up on it. I finished this book, but it was hardly an enjoyable read. The one positive is that the chapters are very short, so it feels like the novel moves along at a nice pace. The actual content, however, is very poor. This book is just surviving off the past Cross novels. If someone was just picking up this book having not read any of the prior Cross novels, they are just not going to understand or care about the subplots involving Cross's estranged son, his other two kids, this new love life, etc. I've read all the books leading up to this book, and I barely cared or understood what was going on.   Compare this to Kiss The Girls or Jack and Jill, and it comes up way short. The story and the plot are very thin and very disjointed. Nothing about this book keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you will only feel compelled to finish it if you are a completist. This was by far the worst of the Cross books. 
 Unless you are a complete novice to the subject, I would avoid this book. These so called 'gurus' merely give some of the ideas they have had for making procedural textures, and suggest what you could potentially do. Then they go into great detail on subjects like beveling a brick texture! Not useful. You WONT find explict texture recipes. You WONT learn how to code a texture engine (like Bryce uses for example). There is little you cant find on the web. If this book were [less expensive] I might be singing a different tune.. 
 Like some of the other reviewers I cannot say that this is an interesting book. I have read many New Age books, many of them quite scholarly. This is just not a good book. Sorry, Mr. Taylor -- better luck in the next life,  eh 
 I bought this CD because it said Eamon as an artist. WTH? I can't find Eamon anywhere on this CD. It says Eamon on the other one, but I'm not even going to try. Never again will a buy a CD associated with Agnus Dei.  LAST WORD: Don't buy this if your buying it for Eamon music 
 I didn't read the book. I was looking for a serious biography of Hoover, after seeing Oliver Stone's primitive representation of a dark perverted homosexual in "Nixon". I thought : "well, it's 2006, this should be a serious object for research now". Looks like I'm wrong. The cover quotes Newsweek: "Eleanor Roosevelt was right. Hoover's FBI was American's Gestapo." Well, this is appalling. I know that Eleanor was a Gestapo specialist, as I know Newsweek is a well-documented contemporary history magazine. I mean, those are the ones you should trust when you look for information either on Gestapo, or Hoover. It means the FBI/Hoover deported Jews and tortured thousands of people, doesn't it ? Do I get the information right ?  I just don't get it: either there's no serious american historians of the 20th american history main characters ; or there is a liberal new order of things on such publications. Maybe there's another possibility, just tell me what's wrong here. Please 
 This abridged edition leaves out many of the most famous passages in this wonderful play. Also, the quality of the sound is very poor. I have bought all the other audio Shakespeare. This is the worst and not worth buying 
 This is a typical mathematical monograph which means it is densely written with almost no examples.  It's too bad since that makes decoding the text much more time  consuming 
 This is an okay read - nothing more, nothing less. The overall plot is very interesting and the story is well told up to a point. The real flaw though is the rushed, and in my opinion, corny, ending to this book. It really was substandard, straight-to-video, B-movie type of stuff (and yes, I am reviewing the book). I won't give too much away, but why at the very end would the chief baddie be the one to carry out 'the deed', and not one of his followers? And why was it the 'good' guy who tracked him down and stopped him carrying out 'the deed' - surely the police / FBI would have got him?   As with John Case's previous book, The Genesis Code, the initial plot will have you hooked, but as the story drags on it does become a little silly and rushed.   
 This volume would have carried a lot more weight if the proofreaders had done their jobs correctly. The many typos detracted from the sometimes useful text. The TV show Bewitched became Bewitch and near the end of the book a page just ended in the middle of a sentence. The next page started a new sentence and thought. Overall I liked what he had to say but I couldn't get past the errors. It just lost its authority with all the sloppiness. 
 This reviewer is grateful that this book was not her first Dash mystery, because it would have been her last.  Ms. Benjamin is too talented a writer to be judged on the basis of what one can only hope is a major and temporary lapse in judgment.  If you're looking to try her work, go straight to her first book.  In this book, Rachel Alexander comes off as not very likeable:  wearing the victim's clothes and jewelry, sleeping with the victim's boyfriend, trying to live the victim's life....all of this has Rachel coming across as a rather sick voyeuristic woman...In fact, her treatment of the victim's boyfriend makes her a rather cruel and callous one.  This reviewer does not understand the purpose behind having the victim's dog witness the crime or how the dog even figures into the plot at all.  And not enough Dash in this book!  Dash is but a secondary decoration in this book...and Rachel even goes out into a dangerous situation in the dead of night, and leaves him behind!!! The only good things I can say about the book is the writing style is good and you will be kept guessing as to what happened in the victim's last moment until the book's end; the problem is that by that point, you'll not care if Rachel herself winds up sharing the victim's fate.  Ms. Benjamin is a better writer than this; her character needs rehabilitation after this book.....The readership deserves more Dash and less trash.....This reviewer's advice:  Only resort to this Dash mystery when you've read all of the others..... 
 Though I am a huge U2 fan, I was disappointed by this book.  It is clear that it is written from a very ambiguous 'post-modern' Christian viewpoint, and this is echoed on every page of the book.  The author's agenda of reframing Christianity in the 'po-mo' world is so obvious and incessant that it ruined all the other aspects of the book.  To end in a cliche way, "I still haven't found what I am looking for" 
 I received this product as a gift. It was broke within 4 hours of opening it. Someone was playing with it normally and the ball smashed the glass hard enough to crack it. This product should have been designed to handle abuse and it broke under normal stress 
 Detailed look at the workings of the Agency and the influence of its Directors on work and morale; however, the author presented an uncritically positive characterization of Tenet and an equally rosy portrayal of President Bush's handling of foreign affairs. The author ignores lingering questions and concerns (e.g. where are the weapons of mass destruction, statements by the Administration linking Hussein and al Qaeda), frequently uses partisan language and soundbites to describe President Clinton, and, overall, comes off as an apologist for the current Bush Administration 
 BradyGames strategy guides...always a hit or miss endeavor.  Unfortunately in the case of Mortal Kombat: Deception, this strategy guide soars far and wide into the 'miss' category.  For starters, the movement commands are tiny...so tiny in fact that you have to strain your eyes and hold the book close up to your face just to interpret the commands!  A good portion of the character's special moves are dead wrong, with either incorrect button or directional presses.  The combos listed are done very half-heartedly...instead of laying out the combo button by button, which is what strategy guides normally do, they opted to use only the name of the combo moves, which, if you bother using the guide, would result in you constantly consulting each of those moves to see what their button combinations are.  Fatality fans be warned...the guide barely has any of the character's finishing moves.  Most of the chracters who are listed have only one of their fatalities listed, and in some rare cases their 'hara kiri' move as well.  However, more than half of the 24 playable characters don't have any of their finishing moves listed, period.  And a few of the finishing moves listed are completely incorrect!  The strategies given for the characters are rather uninspired and half-hearted.  The authors have included a 'Kodex' in the back of the book as an excuse for not having more than half of the character's moves, stating that there are a series of codes on the BradyGames website that you use the Kodex to decpiher.  There happen to be no such codes on the website, further demonstrating the overall useless quality of this strategy guide.  I'm sorry to say that you are far better off just getting a strategy off the internet...this guide is ultimately unfinished and uninspired, and I was rather angry to have wasted my money on it 
 This is not meant to serve as a useful review but as a warning that the positive reviews here at amazon are not reflective of the actual quality of the book. This book, in my opinion, is unreadable and listlessly and discursively meanders. A complete waste of time that lacks depth and resonance. Take time researching this book before you buy it because it's the worst book I've ever purchased. 
 Has one of my fav tracks on it   "Spirit in my life". but as a whole cd my mind kept wandering. The first 2 tracks are killers. shame about the rest. 
 Is this sharing in the 2000s?  I found this whole book very peculiar.  No, I'm not sharing my stuff with you - but I can try to give you something else instead.  I can understand that's how it works sometimes -- but it is it really sharing.  Very strange book 
 I have always been keen to Miguel Migs music releases, and would like to purchase his newest one on Amazon.  So please Amazon, let me listen to samples.. 
 I think the title of the book is misleading.  It is stories of the author's experiences and not very instructive or interesting.  It was not very well written.  Save yout time and money. 
 In the fine print it says "The audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore will not play on some CD and DVD players." This should be in bold face, bright contrasting colors on the cover! I have numerous different CD and DVD players and it will not play on any of them. This is very disappointing as I can't seem to find a "normal" format of this album 
 after carefully mounting the solar panel outside my shed, in plain view of the sun, the shed light worked twice and has never lit up again. After the effort I put in carefully mounting the unit I'm very disappointed and don't feel like rolling the dice and seeing if the replacement will work. 
 I bought this book hoping to get some insight about Mj's years with the Wizards. I was left dissapointed. The author seems to be intent in portraying MJ in a negative light. He does not have quotes to back up some of his words. A lot of the facts are wrong. I understand that, while writing a negative book about Jordan would be different from the normal bioographies out there, the book has to be HONEST. And this is far from honest. As i mentioned before, A LOT of his facts were not true. He blames MJ for the businesses decisions that were made. What he forgets to mention, is that Abe Collins has the final say in any decision. ( He admitted this himself ). Also, how can you say that Jordan's third coming wasn't successful? He had better numbers than lakers superstar Kobe Bryant ( per 48 mins ). The bottom line is that, Leahu is another author trying to make some money by writing a negative book about Jordan. he jsut doesn't have enough negative material, and ends up resorting to lies. Trully disappointing. 
 First of all, before anyone immediately rushes to deem this review "unhelpful", let me describe something.  The concept of this soundtrack is amazing in it's right.  There are majour highlights to this cd which excel past things which other soundtracks are trailing behind in.  However, it is not a perfect cd.    The highlight of the score begins immediately and sets hopes for you to expect.  "Dead Already", despite the ill-sounding name, is a playful track with a great xylophone-marimba tune with an odd sound aiding it in the background.  At first, when things start getting better, Newman introduces his secret weapon: the foreign percussion which he uses.  I have let some of my friends hear this, both foreign and not foreign, and all have agreed on the excellent usage of this for the single opening and ending (which is generally the exact same thing with few differences) tracks.  However, this expectation that was laid down never really fufills itself.  Instead, we have a drone of tracks which sound excellent for about twenty seconds...then become repetitive and warranting a skip.  They all have nice tunes and occassionally a piano theme, but never really go beyond and aadd anything worthwhile.  In track 8, American Beauty, we are given a soothing, gentle piano and strings joint, with one of the most relaxing themes I've heard to date.  The track drones on, but is still a great listen - had it been a bit shorter, it would have been perfect.  This brought the standard up a bit, but then we still have the same repetitive music again later.  "Choking the Bishop", while it worked for the movie, is extremely difficult to listen to.  Finally, "Any Other Name" and "Still Dead" gives us what we already heard, almost exactly to the point.    My basic point is that the concept for this soundtrack is superb, but it has poor execution.  For the film, it works spectacularly, but as a sole soundtrack, it doesn't live up to what it could produce potentially.  However, the few minutes of excellent music we do get to hear is enough to warrant a reccomendation from me, but I will only give it two stars in it's overall presentation 
 Vanishing Voices does a good job of showing how larger languages are destroying smaller ones, and the methods of language death.  This is all pretty much common knowledge.  However, the authors fail in their attempt to give a reason as to WHY language death is something with which we should be concerned.  The only argument they put forth is in a ecological/enviromental analogy, which says that biological diversity is good and stable, therefore, linguistic diversity must.  However, they only go part way in their analogy and reject natural selection for languages.  They also show that linguistic diversity corresponds to environmental diversity, but state this has nothing to do with the inexcessiblity of the areas.  The violin-playing and loaded words are hard to stomach if you are looking for good social science.  I would not suggest the book unless you are an ecological activist wanting to try to link your cause with "saving cultures" or with yet another critique of the West 
 How can someone who has ever learned to write, produce such a stupid paperfilling. If you enyoy reading, pass this bunch of nonsense, else you maybe never touch one book again. How can a sensible person ever think  about a Nobel nomination for this cheese advertising fool 
 We rented this movie, knowing it wouldn't be an Oscar winner or anything. I've seen some bad movies based on video games and comic books, but this took the cake. It was so lame! We thought it would at least be entertaining...no luck there. The best part about it was when it ended. What a relief! 
 I have watched Emeril and perhaps others using this food processor and ending up with liquid all over the counter.  I just dismissed it as part of Emeril's shtick until I bought this machine for myself.  The first time I tried to use it with any liquid ingredients (making mayonnaise), it blew much of the liquid through the joint between the top and the bowl.  The top is just flawed in its design, as it would seem pretty obvious that the part of the top overlapping the side of the bowl should be on the inside rather than the outside of the bowl.  I suppose it had not occurred to me that anyone would design the top in the way that KA did, much less that such a design flaw would be overlooked in so many reviews (e. g. Consumer Reports and Cook's Illustrated).  In any case, this machine is pretty much useless for wet ingredients and borderline for dry (they blow through the badly designed joint as well) unless you feel that wiping up a large part of your ingredients from the counter, the outside of the bowl, the bottom of the machine, and any items nearby is a reasonable thing to expect to do.  I will probably get rid of the machine in some way and go back to the Cuisinart I have had for some time as it is a much better design in this regard. 
 I do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment. But I simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it. This is called censorship, and it gives me the creeps. As a parent, I have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children. So to realise that somebody has been cheating on me, trying to do my job so that I did not have to explain how society has evolved, how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud. this review is about the Harper collins Edition , edited by Patricia C. and Frederick L. McKissak, illustrated by Michael Hague 
 This is a horrible movie with no redeeming value. I realize that such a knock will actually drive people to purchase this. Let me bring something to you attention.  This is a slasher movie with effective gore. In fact, for the time, the gore was more sick that similar movies. However, there are no scares, no suspense, no clever script, no story and it has a stupic ending. I know, that applies to most gore movies!  The problem with this movie is that it is overly mean spirited towards women (I am a man, a 6 foot 235 pound big strong guy that also raises a family).  The story, which has a guy killing women b/c of mistreatment from his mother, seems like it was written and directed by a person that shares the same demons as the killer of the film.    The murders in this movie are so mean-spirited (yet with no cinematic value) that a normal movie goer would have to be offended. This movie is not sick in a "good" movie way but rather sick in an ashamed manner.   This is a woman-bashing movie that should make any viewer feel guilty that they are patronizing this garbage. A movie should have an entertainment value. There is no cinematic, artistic touch on this film.  This is simply a mean, mean movie!    
 This book is very poorly written. This book doesn't define terms, doesn't bother to explain things, and just goes into incredible detail on things that leave the reader lost. I've heard it said that it's for a graduate audience. That's no excuse. 
 The premise of the story caught my attention -- a man presumed dead for years, whose wife had already collected a large insurance policy on him, appears to be alive after all.  The problem is that Sue Grafton's fictional detective Kinsey Millhone is too incompetent to solve the case.  How does she resolve her dilemma?  By asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy Ms. Milhone's curiosity.  Lame!   And then there is this subplot into Ms. Millhone's personal life that leads to nowhere.  I don't know what "K" or the rest of the alphabet has in store for readers, but I'm not interested in finding out 
 This books is a load of nonsense. A prime example of pop spirituality.   There are things in this book that are factually WRONG!!   This nonsense is to philosophy and spirituality what a fastfood hamburger is to cuisine.... you know what? That comparison is unfair. This book is far worse to the spiritual well being of a person than hamburgers are to the physical. 
 I was very disappointed.  The one star I gave it is for the instrumental with the recorder, it was good.  I thought the rest was a very poor tribute to LOTR 
 You'll never get the straight story about nationalism out of Eric Hobsbawm, who himself appears to try to reconcile his own ethnic identity with the topic.  David Pryce-Jones once noted that in Hobsbawm's own autobiography: "he [Hobsbawm] boasts of a visit to Bir Zeit University on the West Bank to display solidarity with the Palestinians.  Why Palestinian nationalism is valid, and Jewish nationalism invalid, is something else Hobsbawm fails to analyze and explain. Quite crudely, he approves of nationalism in countries which proclaim themselves Communist and anti-American, like Cuba or Vietnam, while rejecting nationalism in countries which are not Communist and are pro-American, like Israel" ([...], Jan. 3, 2003).  Such twisted thinking is evident through "Nations and Nationalism," where Mr. Hobsbawm spares no effort, however subtle, to demean nationalism that doesn't conform to his pre-existing prejudices.  In short, when writing about nationalism, Mr. Hobsbawm allowed his considerable analytic and writing skills to become corrupted by his religion, communism.  Therefore, unless you are an acolyte of that religion, this book is not worth your time, money or effort to read, and if you *are* a member of that religion, I suggest you broaden your intellectual horizons a bit, perhaps by reading Liah Greenfield's "Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity" or Benedict Anderson's "Imagined Communities. 
 This printer is capable of producing high quality documents.  But it frequently jams and requires surgery through the back door to get out tiny scraps of paper. Often I have to lift open the top door to get at the ink injector which gets hung up with paper also.  The printer crimps the top left corner of every document.   The scanner function works well and I have had no problems there.   The fax capability is poorly laid out and has never worked.  Overall, whatever cost you pay is not worth the frustration. I would spend my money elsewhere. 
 Beatrice Sparks is the author/editor of a serious of "anonymous" teen diaries. They are meant as "warnings" to children. In fact, they are not based on real diaries and the only one that actually was, she used about 10% of the journal entries and added a Satanic theme which horrified the family.   Now I am aware that children should be taught such things as drugs are bad, teenage pregnancy is not preferable, don't kill yourself etc. However, I take offense when presented in this manner. Children learn best from the truth not extreme propaganda. I also take offense that many libraries (especially school libraries) list this book as non-fiction, when in fact it is a work of fiction. 
 I'm sure this is a great tape for yoga enthusiasts, but it's way too hard for real beginners.  I do aerobic exercise for 30-60 minutes a day, so I'm not a complete couch potato.  I thought I could use some strengthening and stretching exercises, so I bought this program.  The trouble is that there's no working up to the positions  -- it's all or nothing, and if you're not strong or flexible enough to hold the position, down you go.  I found it really, really hard.  I could manage less than half the positions.  Since each flows into the next, you don't get to stop and try less advanced versions.   I hate to think what the advanced programs are like!   I also have a small quarrel with the outside of the package, which says that the participants are of "all body types."   That would be both slim and strong, and very slim and strong.  There are no pudgy real beginners on this tape.  For instance, if you're a woman who can't already do a number of full-body push-ups (no touching your knees to the floor!), you won't get through this tape. I think this would be a good program for people who've already done considerable yoga or strength training.  But it's not for beginners 
 I will not be passing it on to a friend.  The ending left me irritated; why should I close a book with questions in my head?  I will not buy another Picoult book.  I felt "snookered" by Keeping Faith and now I have been fooled twice.  I have to say I did enjoy the book up until the ending, but the Hannah ghost plot was unfulfilled and I was surprised to find out in the middle of the book that Ellie had short hair.  Why didn't I know that before?  Obviously, the characters would have benefited from better descriptions.  
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 This book is good, but the book's content doesn't match the title. This book wasn't written for people who have never owned any piece of property. The book tells you a couple of nice loopholes and hidden fees most first time landlords will get hit hit with out the blue, but that is it! They have whole sections about owning 30 and 40 resident apartment buildings which is something 9 out of 10 people that read this book will not be doing for years. A lot of the advice that they give such as get a lawyer and someone to look at the property before you buy it is common sense. This book also doesn't go into great detail about taxes and how to set the correct rent level like I thought it would. This book is good for a general overview, but that is about it 
 So little is written about the Nagas - Tangkhuls, Maos, Kabius etc living in the Manipur State, or elsewhere in the north-eastern states of India. So this book doesn't represent 'all of the Nagas'. The modern-day Nagas are  warm, friendly, very hospitable and peaceful folks. Music runs in their  soul and they've got the voice to match! Yes, they are indeed, beautiful  people 
 After reading this very badly written book my concern is how I am ever going to trust St. Martin's Press again. This book should never have been published by a company with such a trustworthy track record. Clearly, some house cleaning needs to be done at St. Martin's Press.   The plot development and character development have all the ear markings of a novice writer. Characters are trite, clichéd and very unbelievable. The lead character, Lin Breedlove, is one of the most unsympathetic and unlikable characters in current fiction. So much of Haywood Smith's personal bitterness is encapsulated in this character that you find yourself wishing Ms. Smith had spent a little more time in therapy, following the breakup of her own marriage, instead of charging readers the price of a book for her personal catharsis.   Ms. Smith has created a lead character so misguided, angry and judgmental that the story is painful to read. Some of her misguided beliefs include: Everyone in California has a sexually transmitted disease, you can get venereal disease by sitting on a chair at a wine bar, any man who wants sex without a lifelong commitment is an evil piece of trash and Democrats are bad. Smith barely misses a chance to toss an insult at Democrats, Bill Clinton in particular. So, Democrats beware. You are paying good cash to read a very bad novel and be insulted.   But even more unsettling is the self-righteous world view that masquerades as plot in this novel. It is not only bad writing but a true disregard for one's readers.  There are so many plot mistakes in this book, which should have been caught by Smith or the editors at St. Martin's Press, that I wonder if anyone actually read the final manuscript. At one point in the book, we are told Lin Breedlove first met her ex-husband in college. At another point in the book, we are told she first met him when she was 14 years old. Lin Breedlove criticizes and judges anyone and everything outside her personal sphere of experience and comfort, then harshly deals with anyone who dares criticize her.   The dialogue reads like text lifted from the latest self-help books and very bad pop psychology. What is designed to come off as a feminist point of view is, ultimately, Smith's own shrill cry of personal pain.   One of the most unsettling elements of the book is Smith's constant quoting of scripture, mingled with talk of ten-inch erections, dildos and oral sex. Both subjects, certainly, ideal components of a good novel. Mixed together by Smith's less than deft writing talent? Ummm...yuk.  And, personal note to Ms. Smith - Jerry Mather's of "Leave it to Beaver" fame is not gay.   One last point, there were so many typos in my copy of this book, that it is clear nobody proofed the final draft.   A true waste of money.  
 This is an easy-to-read, secondary source on "attachment" style parenting.  The major drawback of the book is that the author is so caught up telling the story of her own flawed childhood and the emotional scars it left, and comparing her early years to the similarly sad childhoods other people experienced, it begins to sound like yet another "co-dependency" type book.  No wonder the author captured the attention of Sally Jesse Raphael and other popular talk show hosts!  I wished I could just slap her and say, "Life is hard, lady.  Deal with it!"  Actually, this books seems to be just that--a culmination of the author's struggle to deal with her past.  There are a number of more informative and less syrupy secondary sources on mother-infant attachment which I would recommend over this one, such as The Baby Book by William and Martha Sears.  I think there are better books on becoming and being a stay-at-home mother as well, such as What's a Smart Woman Like You Doing at Home? by Linda Burton and Staying Home Instead by Christine Davidson.

 The story started off OK with the first two short chapters.  Then it falls apart.  The template is used but isn't filled out.  The love interest isn't, the bad guys did it but we don't have a clue how the good guys know that.  Getting into the clutches of the bad guys was done by following the script from the (imaginary) Scary Movie series for action fiction.  Getting out of the clutches of the bad guys relied entirely on the stupidity of well-trained mercenaries (who could not have been trained to the level of Scoobie Do if they were really that stupid).  There were a few interesting tidbits on history and historical paraphenalia, glaciers, old planes but the biology was 70's.  A very disappointing read 
 I loved the Sunday Wife.  The book had a great concept however we were lead into little clues along the way of different relationships and twists and turns...and yet nothing went further.  The focus ended up on the one SSG who got cancer and died.  The end left me very empty 
 In order to answer the questions in this edition of Trivial Pursuit you would need an encyclopedic knowledge of the minutae of SNL.  Most of the questions were beyond the ability of my family, who have watched SNL since it began, and who quote it frequently.  I was very disappointed in this game. 
 Can't give a review on Maximum PC.  Never received the magazine.  Instead I was sent the men's magazine FHM.  Please send my Maximum PC 
 When I received the book, the first thing I did was flip to the "About the Author" page and I was really pleased to see that Ms. Bacon had both a degree in psychology and a background in law enforcement.  Those things gave me high hopes that the book would contain some real insight and solid information about the on-line dating dynamic that would work alongside the real-life experiences she'd be sharing with the reader.  I was so wrong.  Her introduction was pretty good, however, once she got into the advice and anecdotes the book went straight down hill.  I found her level of social naiveté to be kind of shocking and her inability to understand why someone (both her dates and her readers) would do something, or even view a situation, differently from her personal viewpoint or opinion, downright irritating.  Also, the attempts at humor led me to far more "Huh?" moments than "Ha!" moments.  I think the author was going for wit, but she missed.  What she got was sarcastic and even demeaning to her readers in several places.  I had to force myself to continue past about page 20.  The second half of the book was a bit better than the first, but by then she'd already lost me.  I've read enough on-line ads to know that there are people out there who actually *do* need to be told to post a good picture, use spell checker, don't lie in your ad, and do your best not to sound desperate.  But, if you're beyond that point and looking for a guide that will help you compose a stand-out ad, write follow-up messages that will help you screen out people who aren't for you, get you to the next level with people who are your type, and safely, successfully, negotiate the transition from on-line and e-mail to face-to-face; do yourself a favor and skip this book 
 this is the absolute worst book i have ever been forced to and have ever read. i would like to add that i made a very strong attempt to get more interested in the plot of this book because it was a school assignment, but jeez, this was cruel and unusual punishment. when i think of this book, the word that comes to mind is "torture". i like a number of books and i love to read, i usually don't have a problem with book assignments, but this was just...just really mean. If you are smart, you will take my advice and stay far away.  
 Latoya was my whole reason for watching AI Season Three.  I stopped watching after she got booted.  Fantasia has chops, but nowhere near the rich vocal texture London has.  She did two performances on the show I would just kill to have taped--a Smoky Robinson song and her version of "Somewhere."    Although  Latoya's song choices while on AI didn't always agree with me, I  still  expected a lot more from her first CD than just another collection of hackneyed contemporary "urban soul" with vapid lyrics.  They are obviously paying somebody in Hollywood a lot of money to turn out truckloads of unlistenable bilge these days.  Being on American Idol must be tons of fun, but ultimately it seems to condemn you to clutter up our landfills with crappy pop music. I only watch the show because good songs are actually performed! I was hoping for maybe something a little more Anita Bakerish, or even Roberta Flackish, for Latoya London, rather than more contrived sexpot swill that arouses no other emotion than horniness.  Latoya London is too classy for this.  Frankly, I still think she's the best singer ever to appear on that show.  But you have to have taste too.  I'm giving this CD 2 stars only because I still love her. 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  Other than the "Preparing for Death" chapter, there was nothing new and I've seen organization much better addressed in other books.  The author seems to concentrate on office work - well, I've done office work for 40 years and she didn't tell me anything I didn't know.  Maybe it would be good for absolute beginners, but anyone who has been around a few years already knows the tricks of opening and sorting mail, filing, etc.  I didn't see anything special about her advice, especially with all those glowing references included with the book 
 So much of this book is dedicated to competition. The exercises given are pretty basic, a few new and interesting ideas, nothing tremendous or special. I've read through it cover to cover and while the writing is entertaining it just wasn't suited for me personally. I was looking for more extensive and dynamic exercises, ways to improve all around performance that I wouldn't see other places. This book gives you ideas and tips on improving your performance, but they are run of the mill ideas that you would get from an averagely knowledgeable person 
 It is constructive to have an open analysis of any controversial topic. If there was no planned extinction of the Armenians by the Ottoman Turks, where are my father's sister, brother and mother.  My father saw them butchered when he was 11 years old.  His sister was younger than he.  He feigned death and managed to escape alive and eventually come to America.  I heard about his experiences first-hand.  Is it possible that these children and mother were threats to the Ottomans?  I think that the claim of the Armenians as a race being a threat to the Turks was a bit far-fetched.  How can that justify murdering mothers and their children 
 This could have been an excellent book but unfortunately the author's writing style makes it unreadable.  I can't remember a book with this many unintelligible sentences.  Don't waste your money 
 This book is a waste of paper.  Little to no useful information or insight into wedding traditions in Scotland.  Dull 
 All of you giving this a favorable review- are you stuck in a time warp or what? Did ya happen to notice the brilliant predictions in the book have not come true? Yeah, when have facts ever gotten in the way of the Green Nazi Agenda? Where is my aerosol can of deodorant, I got all hot after writing that?    
 I have been searching for the perfect handheld sudoku game and this is not it.  I found it very difficult to see the numbers without a backlight even with my reading glasses.  Also I would perfer a stylus pen instead of having to scroll around the screen to enter a number.  I do like the idea of being able to use a dry erase pen to mark off numbers, but I couldn't even see those.  Still searching 
 I didn't think that Manning books could get lower than Wrox, but I was very wrong.  Unless you are doing very, very simple Hibernate 2 or want to how to use XDoclet and Ant, this book is a waste of money. If I were the authors, I would return the money to the publisher. You can forget in depth examples.  This book has the most trivial of examples, but it does have pages and pages of exposition on why Hibernate is so cool.  The real meat could be put into a 12 page booklet.  With a publish date of 2006, this book needs to be more up to date. To make matters worse, some diagrams are incorrect, many pages are smudged and smeared and the book reads as an insult.  I remember the days when computer books were actually helpful and useful, this book brings modern tomes to yet another new low. I thought the on-line docs for Hibernate were bad, but this book is worse.  Wow.  Worse than Wrox AND worse than the on-line docs.  Makes me want to read an old VAX manual just for the fun of it.  This is the first and VERY last Manning book I will ever buy. The few I have read before I was able to get the gist by spending 20 minutes in the bookstore reading.  Peak and Heudecker should stick to creative writing as that is what thy do best in this book 
 I'm of the opinion that King's books rarely translate well into movies, and this is no exception. Some of King's work is fantastic,  but unfortunately, a lot of it is simply tired old themes with nothing new. This falls into the latter category.  A novel about a novelist, and one who has a hard time finding inspiration: Please Mr. King, which college creative writing program did you steal this idea from? The writer's ideas showing up in real life: From whence do these fantastic ideas pour forth?  I won't bother to tell you the ending, because if you have the poor luck to watch the movie, you'll have already guessed it by the time you're half way through. It's all bad and hackneyed, from start to finish.  I will give Steven King credit for putting his fame to good use though. If anyone without Mr. King's fame and built-in fan base tried to sell a story this trite, their manuscript would never make it through the slush pile.   Maybe it takes a bunch of bad stories like this to turn out gems like the Gunslinger series, but it doesn't mean that we have to watch them 
 This book is really nothing more than a collection of generalized knowledge, and some good pictures.  I don't need someone to tell me in a book that I need an engine, transmission, etc to build an old school bobber. "How to" suggests exactly that - you are going to tell me how things get done, and provide me with some good instructions, tips, tricks, and pictures to go along with it.  If you want a book that gets down to the nuts and bolts of the building process, buy something from a different author because this book won't tell you how to build the bobber you want 
 Mail Fraud,I believe its called!! texas shirt company if this is a real company never had this item to sell. I'm surprise Amazon.com is even associating with them..and mike to get this bent out of shape over a $12 dollar item you need to see someone to address your anger issues. 
 It's TM for golfers with a Scotish accent.  Can't believe this book has a following 
 ...when a band that is known for their humor tries to take themselves seriously.  The album that comes before this one, "Take Off Your Pants And Jacket," was a great mix of pop and comedy.  The title alone is a joke.  And the fact that they probably knew that tons of 12-year old kids would be buying that album and hearing songs about f***ing dogs and grandfathers s***ing after eating too many hot dogs, is hilarious to me.  But, alas, this album has nothing to offer.  Blink 182 hopped off the silly bus and took a turn for the worse.  There is not one funny section on this album.  (Perhaps the only funny thing is how commercially successful the song "Feeling This" got).  Anyone else notice that the band decided to break up right after the release of this album, putting out one last album (of greatest hits) simply to fulfill their record contract?  This is most likely because they either realized how far they had fallen or they all became too pretentious for their own good.  Either way, this album sucked... hard.  I wouldn't wish this upon anyone (over the age of 12).  And why this was self-titled is beyond me, as it is completely different than anything they've ever put out.  Blink was better when they sang about adult diapers.  Not reading some stupid letter from a war as some kind of a serious interlude 
 Hey here's an idea. What if Hitler was right all along, only it is men, not jews, who are to blame for all the woes of the world. We should build a new Auschwitz and exterminate them all. Right Andrea? In my opinion, this is just as bad as any misogynist. It's ridiculous garbage like this that has set the women's liberation movement back for so long 
 A dated effort with terrible production quality.  Comes off as smarmy and cheesy.  Accurate information but the same amount of knowledge you would get in your first 1-3 hours of basic group introduction.  Only useful if you want to look like you know what you are doing in the beginners class, otherwise completely unnecessary.  I wanted to like this very much but was sorely disappointed 
 From the reviews, I was expecting more.  The word "discipline" was used so often without giving a clear definition or clear steps of how to obtain it.  A lot of the meaning of this book was lost in ramblings about their authors own lives, families, and innate discipline.  Mostly the emphasis was on maintaining a strict schedule and talking to yourself in your head to trick yourself into doing something.  Yes, positive affirmation can go a long way to training the mind to achieve your goals, but this approach was unscientific and childish.  Save your money 
   This is a book meant to be enjoyed by children under the age of 10.  Young teens and adult readers will be disapointed. Wish I never wasted the time of day reading it. Glad it was borrowed from the library and not purchased or I'd demand my money back 
 . .If you could sue writers for false advertising regarding what they write on bookjackets, you'd have a great case against these two! This book rehashes old legends and stories but provides nothing new. In fact, it does not even provide a good synopsis of what allegedly occurred during the "experiment", providing only bits and pieces along the way. It actually sounds like an addendum to some previous work that assumes you have heard all the cool details, and provides you with a few coincidences that the authors assume support their case. A don't know much about William L. Moore, but I used to read all Charles Berlitz's books when I was a kid, as I thought the Bermuda Triangle made for some great stories. But as I got older, I realized that that's all they were. Charles Berlitz never made any groundbreaking discoveries while "researching" his Bermuda Triangle books, just rehashed old sailor's tales. I recall him during a guest spot on the "Larry King Live" program, and when I Coast Guard officer called in and provided known, verifiable details on some of his "without a trace" cases, Berlitz looked like a monkey. As a former Coast Guard Rescue Pilot myself, stationed for 3 years in Borinquen, Puerto Rico (one of the apexes of the "Triangle"), I can also assure you that it is quite easy for an aircraft or moderately sized vessel to "disappear without a trace", and that there is nothing mysterious about it. . .it's a big ocean! I witnessed the indistinct horizons and other phenomena, all of which had perfectly good explanations. Save yourself some money and avoid all books that have Charles Berlitz's name associated with them unless you're reading them for "entertainment purposes only" 
 book is very small, not many pages, no pictures except on the front page; very disappointed; many recipes don't have anymore fiber than average cookbook 
 Peter was a fair book. I enjoyed reading Peter, however the ending was not satisfying. As I have learned over the years from reading many books, you cannot decide how the book ends. This may seem strange, however, I was disappointed by the ending. Peter was not particularly my taste: a funny, suspenseful book with a firm closing ending. Rather, it is a real-life book teaching a lesson. Whether or not you pick this book is up to you, but if you are looking for a good book to read and found this book by picking at random, or it looked interesting, I recommend that you continue your search. I rate Peter with 2 to 3 stars 
 I am sad it takes so long to send me my first issue-\ Sure it would be good if I was ever to get one? Dave Tuman New Bern , NC 
 The beginning is very well done, then the only interesting parts are the cat-and-mouse between Jude Law and Ed Harris.  The rest of the film is bad, I'd say. Luckily, I recorded it from TV. It is now erased. (By the way, one of the Amazon reviewers who also disliked the film wrote that Bob Hoskins is American. He's from England. 
 I have to agree with the last reviewer, that this book is a bit of a disappointment. Perhaps that is due more to my expectations of the book than the actual content. What I was looking for was concrete techniques to assist in raising children bilingually, with information backed up by research from the field. There is a large amount of research on the topic of bilingualism, and it would be nice to find it summarized in a single volume. However, this is a series of excerpts taken from various parents in bilingual situations together with reasonably obvious statements, with little relation to linguistic research. While the various opinions from parents were interesting, this could be found online at a bilingual forum. The rest, you will probably already know by instinct 
 	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a story of love and compassion, which takes place during the beginnings of the French Revolution. Despite the fact that many aspects of the revolution are portrayed well in the novel, the book is still a tiring read and requires a strong liking for Dickens' writing style.  	Throughout the novel, Dickens bogs the story down with excessive descriptions and meaningless scenes. The language is relatively simple and easy to comprehend, but the extra descriptions make the novel difficult to fully understand. Most of the characters in the novel are completely unrealistic, which makes it difficult for the reader to relate to what is going on. The character of Lucie Manette, is portrayed as the perfect women with absolutely no flaws. Her character is the supposed epitome for women, but in truth, is highly improbable. Throughout the novel, Dickens' does a great job at keeping the story dry and unentertaining, giving little to no excitement to cause the reader to want to continue. Despite these countless imperfections, Dickens' does manage to be partially successful in his quest to portray the revolution.  	The book, with all its shortcomings, did reveal to the reader, the atrocities that occurred during the French Revolution, and the events that led to it. The abuse of the nobles, and the radical ideas of the revolutionists are all shown in many parts of the novel. The one other aspect that Dickens got right in his novel was the character of Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton is the only character in the story that many readers can relate too and understand a variation of what Carton feels. Carton is a lawyer who feels that everything he has done in his life has been wrong and believes that he can do no good in life. This characteristic is common among people, and Dickens manages to capture that aspect of humanity precisely.   	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, is a slow moving book with numerous flaws that cause the reader to lose interest fairly often. Dickens' overuse of description and unrealistic characters add to the book's dryness. However, Dickens does capture a time in history with great accuracy. This is a book for a reader who likes Dickens' overzealous descriptions and enjoys slow moving stories. 
 Kant is a genius; I give him that.  Still, his primary problem is that he presupposes in all his philosophy that there can be nothing beyond the natural and material world.  His aesthetics suffer as he tries to find a completely "objective" way of interpreting and appreciating the arts.  Not only does this not work in theory, but every human knows empirically that music, sunsets, and Monet are simply not capable of being interpreted completely void of feeling or pleasure 
 The recipes included are good, but this is not a "cooking" magazine. This is a women's fitness magazine in disguise. While I am all for a magazine that focuses on overall health and fitness, it shouldn't advertise itself as a cooking magazine. There is way too much other junk. If I wanted a makeover or an exercise routine, I don't expect to go to my cooking magazine to get that. 
 if I didn't watch the movie Green Street Hooligans first. They are almost the same movie. Green Street Hooligans is flat out more entertaining, buy that instead 
 Given high acclaims this film has collected over time, I was glad to pick up a VHS copy at my local library sale.  Began to watch it last night.  I was able to sit thru the part 1.  When the tape ended, I was actually glad. I felt a sense of acomplishment in finishing the part 1!  The movie is DREARY to the max.  People portrayed are irrational, lost, uncommunicative, and subject to random and cruel violence by soldiers and rulers.  In some way, this movie reminded me of the dreary winter (lasting 6 months!) I spent in Russia a couple of years ago...   To me, the movie reflects the psychological breakdown that happened after the decades long terror policy of Soviet state (1920-1956).  For survivors, nothing made any sense anymore, except perhaps fear and evil, as people in this dreary film reflects.  People have been already destroyed in their souls.  They are psychologically shattered beyond repair and only occasional readings of the Bible verses give them any sense of permanence in their chaotic daily experience.   Maybe that is the real meaning of this movie.  To really reflect what happened to people's psyche after Lenin and Stalin's UNLIMITED TERROR, they found a parallel in Mongol's devastation and oppression of medieval Russia.  In both cases, people were left shattered, helpless, irrational, withdrawn,  and autistic.   
 I would very much like to know the names of all the songs contained in this book BEFORE I decide to buy it.  How may I access the "contents" page listing all the songs in this book?  PETER de NIES 
 These last two books by Douglas have been diappointing, indeed. I borrowed Castle Rouge and skimmed through only to keep up on the relationship between Quentin and Nell. I hope the next book in this series is more in keeping with the first three 
 I was disappointed with the quality of these cables.  Mine were defective.  When plugged in the red was WAY over-represented.  The quality of the color was significantly worse than even a standard video cable.  I would not recommend this product 
 If you wish to believe you are permanently damaged, and blameless, and wish to stay damaged: This book is for you. Ms Miller's thesis is  that all of us have been damaged by our parents and we can never overcome that damage and loss of potential. While I am aware, after years as a psychotherapist, that some parents are genuinely abusive, I am also aware that maturity is transcending ones childhood and becoming whole. For some maturity is too much emotional work and they choose to remain damaged, blameless and whining victims. Their choice. Ms Miller further infuriates me by maintaining all children were abused and those believing they had a happy childhood are in denial, dellusional. This book offends me, as a psychotherapist, as a parent and as a mature adult who needs not be a victim of childhood. I suggest instead the Wolins book on Resiliency. And stop whining!!!! 
 The relationships between the various characters weren't convincing and I failed to connect to the main character, Lottie, at all.  The book seemed to ramble on, and didn't catch my interest.  There were a few parts where the action picks up, but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness 
 I started reciving Vibe magazine in the mail announced and unexpected. This wouldn't be the first time this happened, turns out my Grandmother bought me People magazine as a gift and the copies were sent to my house. I figured that somebody had got me this magazine as a gift. Next thing I know a charge for the magazine appears on my bank statement.  I called Vibe immediately and asked them what had happened. They told me that there was nothing they could do and that their company didn't directly deal with the payment issues and subscription services. They gave me a toll free number that I was too call from an outside company that handled the payments. When I called this company, it was completely automated service, could not speak with an actual person regardless of what extension I used.  I eventually had to go down to my bank and find out what I could do. Turns out Vibe had illegally gained my bank account number and had been charging me for months, but I had only just recently started to recieve the magazine. I had to close down my checking account and open up a new one, which resulted in me being charged by my gym and other other companies that had access to my account in order to subtract monthly bills. It was as if I had written them a bad check, something that I had never done in my life and now greatly questioned my credibility.  Please do not support these people, they are theives and on top of that the magazine is terrible and uncredible. I seriously hope that my review will help deter any and all people from subscribing to this magazine 
 On the one hand, I loved the book, since I am a big fan of Thomas Paine. However, my particular copy was missing the last 50 pages or so of "The Age of Reason". When they get the printing and/or binding problems straightend out and have purged the inventory of the defective books, they should remove this review. At that point, I will eagerly buy a new copy 
 I don't see any point in writing nasty reviews and I apologize if this inadvertently comes off as nasty.  I'm just trying to save you some time and money.    I bought this thinking it would be a really good book on pranayama without diving into the one by rosen's teacher Iyengar.  I waited excitedly.  What a waste of time, money and enthusiasm.  He doesn't even cover any kind of pranayama at all in any way that would make it worthwhile to read through this.    He's an official Iyengar yoga teacher and its like he would have had to get permission from on high to teach anything at all meaningful and he knew he couldn't so he settled for this book of basically nothing.    My understanding is his teacher, Iyengar, had tuburculosis (or something a lot like it) as a child and that's why he took up yoga.  For that reason he's kind of weird on the subject of breathing.  He thinks you should "master" the physical exercises before you even begin to do anything like pranayama (whatever the heck "master" means;be a ballet dancer?). He's the only yoga teacher I've ever heard of who thinks this (exept for the legions of people who teach his style).  It's like he got so good at asanas that he thinks that's all that matters.  The point is there's something about the Iyengar set-up that precluded this guy possibly putting out a book on pranayama that was anything but baby food.  Just deep breathing, basically.  After reading this (which is good if you just want examples of different ways the Iyengar people use belts and blankets, excellent pictures) I gave in and bought Iyengars book on pranayama.    I think one could buy that one instead of this and refer to the beginner schedules for pranayama programs in the back of the book and just jump right in.  You can buy it used on amazon for not that much.  I'll be honest with you, I have misgivings about Iyengar as a teacher of anything other than asanas.  I read in one of his books that his teacher didn't really teach him pranayama (he went out on his own as a teacher when he was only eighteen).  I'm not sure where he learned his version of pranayama.  I think he said he may have learned it from a book called hatha yoga pradipika.    You can buy a very good version of "hatha yoga pradipika" on amazon by a guy named hans-ulrich rieker.  Another approachable one is by a swami vishnu-devananda.  A third and longer one, put out by bihar school of yoga is by a lady named Swami Muktibodhananda, who I'm sad to say passed away recently.    Anyway, no matter how much Iyengar yoga is publicised by people like "Yoga Journal" in america, it's really pretty much a one-trick pony.  The books from India put out by "Bihar School of Yoga" are infinitely better.  No matter how wildly popular Iyengar's method is right now there's nowhere to go with it, in terms of it really being a spiritual pathway.  For that you need pranayama and they keep pushing that further into the distance, like a carrot on a stick, with the lame belief that becoming a gymnast is the answer.    If strenght and flexibility where the answer when you go to see the nutcracker ballet at christmas the show would never happen because when the curtain went up all the ballerinas would be laid out prone in samadhi (superconsciousness).  Ok, now all the Iyengar enthusiasts can start throwing bricks at me.  I'm really just telling you the facts 
 Not what I expected...    I thought it did duo patterns of rosettes, but only does one.  I can't not use other Rosette patterns with the set.  It doesn't remain the heat, so it took longer to make the cookies.  
 I am a fan of Shillington and I expected more from this book. His effort to glorify African leaders and condemn Europeans makes this text biased and inaccurate. I would recommend Blaine Harden's "Africa: Dispatches from a Fragile Continent.&quot 
 This is supposed to be "the" bible on Excell. And it is; it has everything there's to know. BUT, if you need to get your answers fast in order to get your work done, don't buy this book. This book, as well as other "bibles" series, are design with a whole CD program with sample exercises. If you go thru them, step by step, you'll learn your stuff. But, if you just need to get into the topic of getting something done quickly, you will find that their explanation is EXACTLY AS THE HELP FUNCTION ON THE SOFTWARE. And then, the will give you an example from that CD program. Believe me, if you don't want to go thru the whole reading process and just need answers in a need basis, this book won't do it. The same applies to the Access Bible.. 
 Musically, this is a great record, a unique snapshot from the jazz-rock fusion scene of the 1970's. It is energetic, raw, full of brilliant and truly original musicianship, not least from Williams and Holdsworth, with its focus on groove and improvisation. From a musical point of view, I'd definitely give it four brightly shining stars.   Technically, however, this 2004 remaster is a disappointment. Following the current "the louder, the better" trend, it has been compressed and limited to death. The dynamics of the original recording are completely lost and life is sucked out of the music. Worst of all, as a result of this headless pumping-up, nasty digital distortion is all over the place, making listening to it a tiring, painful experience.   If you care for the music of this Lifetime gem, do yourself a favour and get "Lifetime: The Collection" instead. It was mastered in 1992, and although the analog to digital converters of the time may have been slightly less refined than they are these days, the dynamics and the over-all listening experience are far superior. 
 It's definitely an awful piece of software. It's totally unstable under winxp sp2 and ie7. Follow other peoples advice and get quicken '06 
 How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction.  I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said. I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books.  At least the movies keep your interest 
 By chance before picking this up I had just finished The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. It's a great "compare and contrast" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.  Both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. Heart published in 1940, and Castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s.   Both families are poor. In Castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. This is supposedly because they "don't know how to do anything". So instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. How charming! They are "eccentric", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. Only Stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of Cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. But he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. Even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum Topaz--striking poses.  Unlike the looming and grinding poverty of Heart then, the poverty in the Castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. Not so in America where Mick Kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at Woolworth's, and to a life of little hope.  In Castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. Two dashing young wealthy Americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. They throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant American style. Most of the remainder of the novel consists of Cassandra and her sister Rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being.   It's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. If your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you!  The reviews for this novel in Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Smith was obviously talented. Her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. I wish she had given Cassandra a little more ambition. 
 I suppose if you never read the book, you might think this movie is good... maybe even charming.  But having gone into the theatre with this as my favorite novel, I was so grossly disappointed I can't tell you.    See, the book is about two people - Novalee and Willie Jack.  They head West together, until Willie Jack abandons her at a WalMart.  They part ways on more than one level - his life goes as low as a life can, and her life rises beautifully.  It's a study in contrasts, and it's done impeccably in the novel, with a plethora of complex characters to richen the journey... but it didn't translate because of Hollywood's froo-froo mentality.  Hollywood cut Benny Goodluck - a main character in the novel - completely out and shaved Moses(another major character) down to a bit part while making Novalee's one-visit-mother a major player.  And they DESTROYED Forney... who is supposed to be eccentric, late-thirties genius, withdrawn and strange... they turned him into a twenty-something easy-going stud type with a crooked smile.  SO. NOT. FORNEY.  I never wanted to jump thru the screen and slap people so badly in my life.  That horrid.  And Lexie... she's supposed to be a size 22 with four kids and white-trash tendencies... and they put ASHLEY JUDD in the role.  Hello...?!?!  Does that picture at the top look like a size 22 with four kids and white trash tendencies to you? That's just the biggie complaints, too.    Read the book, don't watch the movie.  You'll be amazed at how inept Hollywood was at telling this story 
 I tried really hard to like this book, but I found it just a poor rehash of information already put forward by William Sutherland D.O, the father of Cranial Osteopathy and John E. Upledger, D.O., O.M.M., the developer of CranioSacral Therapy.  For a true Visionary approach to "CranioSacral" work, you should consult the works of Sutherland and Upledger 
 I didn't find Dr. Bader's arguments to be very persuasive.  He seemed to over simplify things to a point where nuance and complexity was lost.  Perhaps the case studies that he used included much more data than he based his explantions on.  If so, I wish he shared this additional information because a lot of his reasoning wasn't as obvious to me as it was to him.  For example, I could come up with lots of alternative ways to interpret what was going on and for Dr. Bader it seemed like there was only one right interpreation -- his.  While this book has some value, especially for people who may not have read much in this area, I thought it was superficial.  It wasn't complex enough for a psychotherapy audience and it didn't seem to be a good fit for the popular psyche market either.  I think one would get a better and clearer understanding from Jack Morin's book "Your Erotic Mind."  I don't know of anything better out there on this topic.  The two authors approach the subject differently, so if you own this book already, you may want to consider a different perspective.  
 First, as always, the disclaimer. I am a regional author (Suomalaiset: People of the Marsh; ISBN 0972005064) and, like all authors, prone to fighting fits of envy. So, take what I am about to write with a grain of salt. I loved "Cold Mountain". Loved the premise,the historical truth, the characters, the setting, and the writing. I looked forward to the much hyped second effort by Mr. Frazier. The good news is that his writing is still exemplary. By that, I mean the man certainly knows how to turn a phrase. But that's about all I can say, in terms of positives, about this effort. The plot seems overblown and quite frankly, totally preposterous. The main character, Will, is thrown into wars, and disasters, and inclement weather, and every other kind of malady, only to survive, essentially unchanged and unscathed, while all those around him fall or fail. His ability to amass a fortune and hundreds of thousands of acres of land seems, given his humble beginnings, to strain even my vivid imagination. The descriptions of the landscape are lovely but lost in a plot that has no point. The first quarter of the book, the beginnings of a love affair between Will and Claire, the love of Will's life, has promise. Then, for the greater part of half of the novel, we are immersed endlessly in tedium surrounding Will and his adopted Indian tribe, the only point of which seems is to convince us that Will's greed isn't selfish, but done for the good his Red Brothers and Sisters. Far too late, and in a strained and surrealistic manner, the story comes back to Will and Claire. But by then, my patience was worn thin and the return to the real story, the interpersonal struggle between the lovers, had lost its appeal. Two stars might be a little light but that's how I see it.  
 I hate AC/DC, them and Metallica are extremely overrated in the metal department.  As musicians, these guys are very average AT BEST, most of the time, they're below average.  It doesn't matter if it's Bon Scott or Brian Johnson singing for them, AC/DC has always sucked.  Unlike other metal bands like Slayer and Sepultura, AC/DC's songs are very cheesy and boring, the only thing this is good for is the whiff of nostalgia.  Want real 80's metal (not glam)?  Go for Slayer, Sepultura, Kreator, Exodus, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer and many others 
 This is just a piece of ***  Hollywood has shown here that they just have no new ideas/stories so they continue to try and use special effects and a bad scriptwriters to remake what was and still is one of the best movies ever.  This is not the first Hollywood remake that is garbage and will not be the last but as long as there are people willing to part with good money to watch movies it won't change.   This is a good reason why Blockbuster have lost sales recently - nothing worth watchin 
 shouldn't a "masterpiece" of comedy be ... i don't know ...   funny 
 this book was written by a lawyer, and what can you expect, the basic message is: hire a lawyer (like the author of this book). The other advice is to go to a website, where you can buy template contracts etc, the books doens't give you a single one for free. It's just an advertisment of this website. All creative aspects of runing independent record label are reduced to minimum, also don't expect to get many practical advices, other than pay more money to other professionals, who will do everything for you. The author says, thay you don't need big money to run a record label, but doesn't give you a single hint how to actuall do it without big money, he is just repeating over and over that spending money on professional services is the thing to do. Well, right, I know that without this book, the problem is - I can't afford it! This book doesn't help you to solve this problem (and I'm sure you don't start with $50 000 for the first release, right?). Overal, this book doesn't give you practival advices, just general advices, which are nice, if you can afford them. And by the way, go to the website recommended by the author (I won't advertise it here, the book is the advertisment in fact) and buy all contracts from them! I love lawyers 
 The first time using the product, two of the stainless steel wires broke!  I am still able to use part of the slicer, but it is not effective 
 Although the body of the squirrel is still intact, our Pug tore the fur off the tail of the squirrel the first day he had it.  He still plays with the body and there is nothing for him to choke on, but I was disappointed that it fell apart so quickly 
 I have to admit that my wife read this book first and said it was slow.  She didn't say how slow though.  But rather than take her word for it (why should I?  After all, she's my wife) I bothered to pick it up and read it.  How I wish I had listened to her and left it in the box of stuff for the rummage sale.  I cannot stand Baldacci's juvenile charactor dialog, but finish it I did though most of it I could have read through closed eyes and not missed anything.  I'll stick with my Nelson DeMille from here on if I want literary junk food 
 I never recieved this book.  I have no clue what has happened. 
 The only trouble with this very interesting and readable book is that its conclusions have long since been discredited by eminent specialists in the field 
 The other reviewers have been right on target. Too bad I did not read their comments before I picked up this book. It is boring, mindless, and not particularly well written. The characters are shallow, there isn't much of a plot - if any - and the ending is just too tidy and convenient. Don't wste your time - make a different choice 
 I had the misfortunate to hear these little twerps attempt to choke out some lyrics, if you can call them that, and I have to admit...it made me cry.  Not with joy, but with shame, for having forced my ears to endure such a terrible ordeal.  Woe is me.   On a list of horrible atrocities commited by mankind, this record falls somewhere between N*Sync's first record and the actual Holocaust.  How people can give them five stars without Hell freezing over is beyond me 
 This is the book that has gathered together all the most annoying people in science studies -- especially the ones who flog the dead horse of 'practise'without considering the larger social and political contexts that have made the Science Wars such a hot issue. I would advise so-called Science Warriors looking for an easy target to look no further than this arboreal sacrifice. Everyone else: check out David Hess's introduction to science studies for something more reasonable and Steve Fuller's book on Kuhn for something really challenging 
 I don't know why I try to stomach reading books from a war criminal.  I suppose we all must read and listen to the criminal mind so that we can understand why they become such monsters.  I've read Hitler, Stalin, and Kissinger (and the rest).  Don't buy this book...instead find yourself a copy of the book or documentary called "The Trial of Henry Kissinger" 
 I picked up this book after reading about it on the Simple Living network, which I found as an outgrowth of my interest in the work of the late Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin and their work "Your Money or Your Life".  Unlike Mr. Dominguez and Ms. Robin, who manage to lay out an actual plan for simple living, Ms. Andrews chooses to ramble and rail against consumerism.  After reading Dominguez, this book is disjointed, preachy and quite frankly, bad. That's not so say that Ms. Andrews doesn't have some good ideas.  She does, but as with so many anecdotal books, they're not the basis for changing your life in any significant way.  If you live an environmentally sensitive life, Ms. Andrews will certainly make you feel good about yourself, but if  your goal is to simplify your life, you could do better than spending time on this book 
 another INFEDEL biased against christian with lots of errors just like phony dan brown 
 The most disappointing part of this book is its blatant political slant.  The book is NOT about a theory of leadership, but about an ideological judgement of the performance of leaders.  Heifetz starts by insisting that leadership is necessarily tied to values because if you disagree....then the rest of his book is meaningless.  Heifetz believes that to be a good leader you have to adopt positions that he advocates and if you don't, then you aren't a good leader.  So, in Heifetz's world, Reagan wasn't a good leader, but LBJ was.    Do yourself a favor and keep surfing... 
 I watched Battlefield Earth because it just went into rotation on a cable movie channel and I had to see if the rumors were true.  I made it to the end, waiting and hoping all the while for some redemption that would make it worth the trip.  Sadly that never came, and as the credits rolled I chose to fall in line with everyone else who says this movie is an unqualified disaster.  In fairness to Travolta (though he is hardly blameless), L. Ron Hubbard's story is the main culprit, horribly conceived and best considered another failure of many by a misguided loon.  That said, those who follow crazy people don't deserve much more respect.  If Travolta wished to venerate his fearless leader, the least he could have done was attempt to turn Hubbard's semi-fictional paranoia into something at least marginally entertaining.  Artistic license would have gone a long way toward saving this mess.  Instead, the story became a mockery of itself, leaving this production a sad effort from otherwise very talented actors 
 Nice look, good feel, turns on fast, takes great pictures.  Really great, with ridiculous depth of field and resolution, you can in no way appreciate how good the pictures will look on the LCD back, which is huge.  So, what's my beef?  Slow pictures, double flash, slow slow follow on shot, slow.  Okay say cheese, one second, two seconds.... i only got thiis camera because I thought that problem was solved.  Yes my battery is charged, no I do not see how to stop the problem other than no flash at all... where is one flash and let me worry about the red eye? slow- i hate it!!!!!!  Still, its awsome, slick, and a fair price 
 I had never read a John Grisham book.  But I am generally a believer in the notion that "if something is hugely popular, there must be a reason for it being so."  So I assumed there was something massively entertaining about John Grisham's writing.  A week ago I picked up "The Street Lawyer," and I was prepared to be entertained.  Boy, was I wrong.  This book stinks to high heavens.  This man cannot write.  "The Street Lawyer" is badly written, stupidly plotted, and riddled with banalities and cliches.  I could go on, with great fervor, for hundreds of words, about what makes this book abysmally bad, but I'm going to save my energy.  Please, just trust me, this book is terrible.  I shudder to think that the American reading public is engrossed by this man's words 
 BLOOD MERIDIAN is a novella or long short story streched out to make a 335-page novel. There is basically little if any plot. While Cormac McCarthy can write poetically, writing poetically about nothing is still nothing. It's like a million times zero is still zero. Most of the book is just one murder, slaughter, killing, massacre, beating, stabbing, shooting, scalping after another. It is an unrelentingly dark and depressing view of a time and place in history (Mexico and the southwest in the 19th century) without any redeeming happiness or hope. You cannot read this book from end to end without becoming depressed yourself. While I admire Mr. McCarthy's writing (see my wildly favorable review of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN), BLOOD MERIDIAN is not worth your time or the fourteen dollars the book costs. Don't contaminate your mind with this jumped-up short story 
 This was one of the boringest books i've ever read.... Unless you want to kill serious time, and you love all types of science-fiction... then this is the book for you. If not, then don't try reading this book. I don't like books that don't get you hooked in, and this DEFINITELY doesn't get you hooked. That's all i have to say about it. 
 I wanted to like this book.  I wanted to learn something about the modern rise of anti-semitism.  Sometimes, you just don't get what you want.  I read the book, hoping to answer some serious questions: Is anti-Zionism the same as anti-semitism ?  Are Jewish anti-Zionists experiencing self-hate ?  Is the rise of European anti-semitism a product of long lasting traditions or a by-product of Muslim immigration ?  I still have these questions.  The book does attempt to address these issues.  It does so by a selectively culling statements, events, and quotes.  Where a book of this nature would demand 100's of pages, the author here feels that his cobbled collection of editorials can address these issues with limited research and less than 200 pages.  It is tragic that such a serious topic is handled, so casually.  Like many people, I fear a second Holocaust prompted by Iranian nuclear ambitions.  What does Schoenfeld think of this issue ?  He agrees that such a threat exists, but sees fit to address it in only one paragraph.  What about a solution to the rise of anti-semitism ?  The only one I can find, is the belief that a stable democratic Iraq will reduce the phenomena.  I don't want to get too political here, but that's a pretty disquieting source of optimism.  There is something here, but there's not quite enough.  I don't disagree with the author, but I don't feel that throwing out a collection of individual opinions constitutes a serious analysis of a serious topic. 
 Very simply, this is not the best movie guide out there as other reviewers have stated.  While, it does add a lot of new films released each year, it does so at the expense of older films.  The reviewers have a tendancy to gush over these new releases and underrate or compleletly ignore films that truly have standed the test of time.   I don't want to get in a rant about specific film reviews but I think the reviewers do follow a certain pattern.  If the movie made lots of money it is most likely to be rated higher than so called "flops".  However, an exception is made for films that are too violent, too sexual, or too dark, even if they were succesful or developed a cult following because this is basically a family orientated movie guide.  Movies made in the last several years are usually rated higher than the ones that were made in the film industry's youth.  Many people's opinion will agree that today's films are more entertaining for today's audiences but I am of the opinion that there are film treasures to be found in all eras. In some cases the reviews of these older films are so vague that it makes me wonder if the reviewer ever saw the film that is being reviewed or are they just recycling and paraphrasing some old review.  The biggest weakness of this book is that it does not include a great many movies at all.  In comparison with the Blockbuster movie guide and Maltin's classic guide, this one is the most likely to have the film missing.  It is weak on B-westerns and films prior to the 80's.  Maltin's classic guide is good because at least pre 1960 films won't be dropped and forgotten completely, the blockbuster guide is nice because it has detailed reviews that aren't too pompous in regards to the reviewers opinion.    Besides the lack of old reviews I do have a problem with this guide's ratings of many more modern films.  Independence Day given 4.1/2 stars, this film is truly awful besides the special effects.  The US is having all kinds of problems finishing off the Iraq war yet we could beat aliens in a day or two with the president doing the dirty work.  This is laughably bad even though President Bush might think it is believable, Starship Troppers was better or at least more entertaining treating basically the same subject tongue in cheek, the reviewers gave Troopers 2 stars.  Perhaps the most disappointing visit to the theater I ever had was going to see Star Wars episode one, the reviewers gave it 5 stars, saying it was only second to the original.  What? Enough said.  Episode two also got 5 stars.  I could go on all day ripping on the reviewers here, instead let me just say this is not for film buffs, maybe if you are half way interested in films and want to save a couple of bucks buy this guide. No guide will ever be fully comprehensive or objective, and this one is truly an example of that fact.  
 I'd give this no stars but it won't let me.  Why would anyone buy this? I was in Compusa today as they are closing down on Long Island & thought about buying this. I put it down & said I will researh this more at home. As I suspected, you can go to [...] & do the same thing that this software does. The software doesn't allow you to print stamps at home so what's the point? The only plus is that you get a sheet of free stamps, so it's like buying a [...] coupon, that's a one time use. I don't get it 
 I have had to replace this carafe four times in one year. If you accidently tap the carafe even lightly, the whole thing cracks! I can't stand this carafe, but after spending $100 on the coffeemaker, I'm stuck with it for a little while 
 I know H. James is considered one of the "Greats" of American literature and I question my taste for hating most of his writing.  With few exceptions I think he is  a pretentious purveyor of obscurantism.  I read Wings of the Dove many years ago in the days when I would not allow myself to set aside books I did not enjoy.  I recently picked up a collection of his short stories and remembered why I disliked him so much.  Now in my old age I had no pangs of conscience when I happily closed the book before finishing it.  If more of the stories had been like Daisy Miller I would have proceeded further but unfortunately much of the writing reminded me of Wings.  I am currently seeking  relief from Henry's turgid prose by reading Hemingway.  I'd trade in a Henry  for an Ernie any day.  It's also difficult to like Mr. James' snobbish, shallow and unsympathetic characters.  The more sympathetic ones were obscured by his heavy hand and my impatience with his style.        
 I read this years ago for a class I was taking. It was awful, but required.  At the same time I was working the night shift in a psychiatric hospital.  The book bears absolutely no resemblence to the real world of mental illness.   If you have to read this book for a course, hopefully you will then move on to a more interesting and useful class.   If you want realism, try Ken Kesey's "One flew over the Cookoo's nest".  Everyone I was working with at the state hospital read this book, then the local college produced it. A lot of the patients were taken to see the play and they loved it. (This was before "patients" became "clients").  The movie gave me nightmares; I saw it after I left the hospital and it was too real.  The mental health field has of course changed considerably since the 70's and a lot of those people are now out on the streets talking to themselves.  Unfortunately Szasz is a classic theorist and this book will still continue to be read 
 After having read the book, I was left with a mixed feeling. The content of the book is OK. Not special, just OK. If this book changed your way of thinking about risk, then this is probably one of your first books you read on the subject. I give the book content 4 stars, since it's decent, easy to follow and fairly complete. Besides that, the author included three good articles at the end of the book, one of which (by Caroline Hamilton) is particularly well-written.  Now for the style. I can only agree with one of the other reviewers regarding the comment he made about proofreading the book. I wonder if the book was proofread at all. There are so many errors and annoyances in this book, it starts working on my nerves fairly quickly. To name but a few:   The writer contradicts himself on several occasions. Sometimes this gets hilarious: - Page 30: [The cost/benefit analysis] is the most important step of any risk analysis process. - Page 35: As discussed in the previous example, the scope statement is the most important element of the risk analysis process. - Page 39: The most important element of any risk analysis process is the recommendations of controls and safeguards... etc etc.   I understand that mister O'Leary is his mentor, but don't tell me five $%^$@ times that he is the Director of the Education Resource Center (pages ix, 12, 13, 65, 66).   The spelling errors are a real pain in the butt:  - page 217: "Aurebach" instead of "Auerbach" (my favorite; it's his own publisher). - page 16: "can shared" instead of "can be shared" - page 36: ".appropriate" instead of "appropriate" - page 43: "their role" instead of "his role" - page 45: "control" instead of "risk" (last word on the page) - page 46: "these" instead of "there" - page 47: "guideline" instead of "guidelines" - page 55: "their" instead of "its" (it refers back to "job") - page 64: wrong comma usage - page 71: "in" instead of "it" - ..... - page 162: "Originizational" instead of "Organizational" - page 217: "Ozierz's" instead of "Ozier's"   The writer uses the Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V too many times. Definitions should be reworded, not blindly copied. See pages 7 and 57, pages 47 and 72 etc.  Sometimes bulleted items in the same list have a trailing dot, sometimes they haven't.  I can go on and on.  To wrap it up, the writing gets 1 star. Equals 5 stars. Which will be rounded to 2 stars, simply because of his sloppy writing. If the writing were better, I might give it 3 or 4 stars 
 My wife gave me this jumbled collection of stereotypes and cliches to read because she thought its heroine eerily reminded her of a long ago mutual friend.    The heroine or author's alter-ego I guess met every single expectation I had for the second, indeed third rate chick lit it turned out to be. This plows the same tired soil as Nora Ephron (who at least can be funny at times). It proves the old contention that indeed there is no such thing as being almost pregnant, In this case, funny,. Heronie Sandra Berlin is niether witty nor much to like our friend;. she is an self-absorbed intellectual phoney masquerading as a wounded young woman editor dumped by her wasp god boyffriend trying vainly to reconstruct her life after the cad shows his true colors, red, white and blue. (Do we see the teeth of an upper west side Eleanor Roosevelt  swooning liberal booklicker showing  here?)   Anyway suffice to say the Sandy Berlin character might have registered to the reality of memory of our old real friend had she and her multitude of dilemmas not exhibited every single stereotypical takes on the 80s by the Union of Soviet Socialistic Reblic of Zabars: There are girls up that way who actually are interesting and made of real flesh.    1. Sandy is self-hating Jewish and comes from the semi-priveldeged tatterdown edge of a tony NY suburb called Greenhills. (Read Scarsdale where they  manufacture young media wannabees like so many potato latkes). her mother is of course a profession woman, her father predictively indifferent and usually buried in a book.   2.Her picture of the wasp world of her kiddie boyfriend reeks of condescending snobbery at their affinity for Afghans, booze, sailing, and apparent paucity of intellectual curiousity and suggests, heaven forefend that  the Roosevelt lady (who never had an original thought in her entire well meaning public life) was a saint.   3.The best friend confidante role is played by a gay man, also a cardboard cutout, who of course, parties constantly and pays the price by contracting AIDS. he is often referred to by Sandra by his last name in that smarmy phoney inside way that reeks of private high school girls locker room talk.    Every plot turn is contrived (was she writing for a screen option? maybe since most of the developmment executives in many studios tend also to be media phoney refugees from Scarsdale High as well. it probably worked).   IIf you want real live chick lit fun that even men would love try Sophie Kinsella's "Shopaholic" books. Her gal, Becky Bloomwood is a) genuinely funny  b) wildly original c)self absorbed in an absolutely lovable, seductive way and her plot twists, nutty as they are engage you from first to last.. By contrast, i couldn't care less about the ever whiny Sandra Berlin.   I understand this author is a food writer and I can see that being immersed in the media world, anywhere, can lead to book contracts if you lick enough plates at Orso's, or Le Bec Fin or wherever else these people hung out in the 80s..         
 Don't waste a single penny on this movie! It was total crap!No plot what so every and the main character was horrible! My eyes are still burning from this one 
 I agree with the arguments in the book, but as I progressed past the first chapter I got the feeling the Author was strecthing it out to turn his magazine article into a book 
 The amount of time resulted in minimal results--I was very disappointed 
 In the 1950s, television filled the void left by the Senate inquiries and the imposition of the comics code. A new resurgence in the 60s, comic books were exciting again, carrying into the 70s spurred by superhero AND horror/mystery comics. Bottoming out again in the eighties, this time the culprit- video games.  Today the enemies, television and gaming, are still with us vieing for our time. Comics are not truly accessable to the buying public. They've become the property of an exclusive club that seems to revel mostly in some artist's wet dreams. How nice to know they can excercise his or her artistic rights and freedom. But no one is buying it! It's dead for all intents and purposes. Comic shops have to fill their shelves with collectible toys to make it. The comics I buy are at liest more than 30 years old. The new ones just are not interesting and even with all of this self-examination and navel probing, the quality just isn't there. It's my opinion that it doesn't have to read like Shakespear and look like Rembrant to be a good comic. But it must entertain. The effort has been underway for years to leave the lowly comic book in the dust, replaced by the Graphic Novel. All in the name of impoving (the perception anyway) of the comic book market! Even HBOs Tales From the Crypt" opening credits state 'Adapted from the comic MAGAZINE...'  The internet will not save comic books. It isn't a 'book' in the first place. Illegal downloading will kill it. Scanning comic books is already a problem.  The salvation of the medium is in the hands of something that is not real? If you cannot hold it and carress it in your hands like a lover then it will not satisfy (oops, better watch my own dreaming!). I do have a love affair with comic books. The only salvation I believe are two things:  1) Comic books must be put back into the public eye through stores or what have you. Recruitment to comic books through casual 'walk by' customers who are not necessarily seeking out comics, they just happen upon them out in public stores. Yes, the great unwashed and 'unenlightend' masses parting with their three bucks is the only thing that will help save the comicbooks! 2) The superhero must die! And artists and writers must excercise self control or face the imposition of a new comics code 
 Holbeins illustrations are brilliant and fascinating.  This book is very inexpensive.  These two factors should make it a great addition to any library.  But the images are something like 2 inches square.  You can't see any detail really.  I was disappointed and I guess I'll have to find another book as I would like to enjoy this macabre and fascinating series 
 save your money.  my copy is going back to be sold as "used", i guess.  stories aren't bad but the narration is horrible.  probably better read instead of heard.  it's hard to get aroused when some man with a "not so hot" voice is telling you an erotic story and doing a poor job at it as well.  in a word, ...cheesy 
 We can't add anything to Christianity, there are no more Gospels.  Nothing that we need to add, no stories we need to tell, or make up to explain who God is or what He thinks.  It is all before us.  He's told His story, He's revealed His character, and His Truth through the bible.  Glenda's book, to me, is half-baked.  She even admits she is no theologian.  Maybe that's where she should start with the bible herself, instead of making up stories about her conversations with God that are not biblically sound and contradict the Truth of who He is.  She puts way too much emphasis on the individual.  She stressed throughout her book that "we" are love, If we are Love, then why do we need a Savior.  If we are perfect why did He send His son to die for our sins?  Glenda's book is not one of Christianity, it is philosophy.  Self help, not surrender to a higher power.  She is promoting herself, her work.  We don't need her telling us what He thinks, He already has.  We ourselves, can go directly to the source.  He layed Himself out to us, fully exposed.  No hypothesizing necessary from authors like Glenda.  
 Trash sells and this is the definition of trash. Unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction. Shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research. Readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write 
 When you make claims like that you'd better be able to back them up. Ms. Green does not. I live in Portland, Oregon, a fairly cosmopolitan city but no New York, Paris or Singapore. We have little Russian specialty stores and big pan-Asian supermarkets such as Uwajimaya and Fubon. Off the top of my head I can name a couple dozen vegetables which are perennially on the shelves at these two places from shen choy and bitter melon to gingko seeds, padan and pea sprouts. These are all commonplace in East Asian cooking. None even gets a mention.  It's good as far as it goes, so it doesn't get one star. It doesn't even come close to its brag, so it gets no more than two 
 Like most indie gay themed movies, "Trick" had quite a bit of buzz around it. A terrific movie with Tori Spelling! How could I not love it?  I loved "Die Mommy, Die!", "Girls Will Be Girls", and "Jeffrey". So I gotta love this too, right? Right??  I found it cloyingly sweet and completely out of touch with reality. A hot go-go boy wants to hook up with a nerdy dweeb?    Uh... why??  So they spend the whole evening looking for a place to get busy.  And then it's one contrived situation after another getting in the way of their plans.  As much as I can't stand Tori Spelling's "acting", she's the only performer not phoning it in. (Maybe she had an extra espresso before the shoots?)  What little life there is in this movie, it owes it to her.  The problem is that both male leads are incredibly dull and not that good looking.  The "sizzling" dancer looked like bored monkey. And the soft, sensitive Gabriel has no personality. Why these two people continue to want to have sex with each other after six hours of roadblocks is a complete mystery.  I guess if go-go boy dropped the zero and found another guy (which wouldn't be too much of an effort for him), there wouldn't be much of a movie.  A cameo by Miss Coco Peru is a nice treat.  But she's lit so unflatteringly and gives a monologue so ghoulish, you'd think she was in a different movie.  High expectations, very low gratification. Honestly, skip it 
 "Academ's Fury" tries to compensate for a weak plot by switching viewpoints every few pages. The previous book, "Furies of Calderon", more interesting. Nothing at all like Butcher's wizard/detective series.  If you enjoy J.V. Jones' works, then I expect you'll enjoy this sequel 
 I truly wanted to like this book.  After years of avoidance I had just finished Moby Dick and found it not only more readable than I'd feared but downright enjoyable.  In addition I'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me, and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature:  "Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last."  Alas, it was all down hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish.  This came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack.  Author of two other published novels and a short story collection, director of a university level creative writing program, long-term teacher of writing, and holder of a Ph.D. in same, all to considerable critical acclaim, she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this not producing it.  So what went wrong?  How did this novel end up so awful?  The answer is brick by brick and piece by piece.  There is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things.  LENGTH: If "brevity is the soul of wit", this novel's witlessness is easily explained.  At 666 pages (interesting number that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been.  It would seem that, to some extent like Melville before her, Naslund confused Length with Importance, but Melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is.  IMHO this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing Naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody.  Somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel, but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw.  THE NAME DROPPING: One of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures, but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend.  They are badly handled here.  An almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of Kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century New England and those she doesn't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with Naslund's peculiar imagining of Nathaniel Hawthorne.  One or two of these, developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude.  As it is, it is a Zelig or a Forrest Gump without the humor (or the self-awareness).  THE POLITICS: Even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century New Englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel, so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing.  However, Naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having Una espouse the Politically Correct view on every single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling, from feminism to free love, from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled, all without consequence or even criticism.  This latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves.  Una espouses them with all the negative consequences that Naslund receives for espousing them today, which is to say: none.  THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTRY: There is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time, but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted.  It is even sillier to portray Christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish, the bigoted, the future apostate, or the mentally ill.  It tells us more about the author than anything else that Una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time EXCEPT Christianity.  THE FARFETCHED SCENARIOS: I sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which Una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter....  After this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic.  After her crazy Christian father threatens to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand), Una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle, encounters two young men who both fall in love with her, disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them, successfully avoids detection, is sunk by a whale, survives by committing cannibalism, marries the surviving young man after he goes insane, and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the Indians, leaving her free to "marry" Captain Ahab (Una never really "marries" anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes).  Things don't get more realistic in the second half, which includes Una's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale.  Riiiight.  THE MARY SUE: However, the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a "Mary Sue" that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader.  A more realistic main character might have saved it.  Una never learns anything from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything.  She doesn't change because she is already perfect.  She doesn't have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn't receive any, and she doesn't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides, Una had her reasons (and they were very good ones you can be sure).  The only thing I can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone WITHOUT anyone ever reading it.  I feel like I've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading Moby Dick in her bedroom... with the door locked. 
 Not that I haven't enjoyed the puzzle book - but shouldn't the game guide not make the game even more complicated?  I've gone half blind trying to figure out the maps.  Certainly my favorite is when the master map is wrong, the thumbnail picture is wrong, and the tiny map in the thumbnail picture is wrong.  I feel collecting the horseshoes and photo ops is one of my greatest achievements as the guide is actively plotting against me.  Even the mission guides are of little use, as all they do is tell you what the game already told you, "go upstairs", sweet.  I remember the GTA III guide used to tip you off to the occasional short-cut or some such.  This one both sucks and blows.  I want my $14 back. 
 This book by Helen S. Garson is quite subpar.  Most of the "facts" that she gives are things that can be found (...)from watching cable shows that talk about Oprah.  Oprah has set the new standard of what talk shows should be, but Ms. Garson did a poor job in showing this.  She even describes Oprah as "clowning" for her viewers and audience when she gets excited about something on her show.  Yes, I consider myself an "Oprah supporter," and was very disappointed in this biography.  The next time Ms. Garson wants to write a biography about a celebrity, she should get her research from more places than the local library.   
 I couldn't even get 2 chapters into the book. It is that boring to me! Might try and read some other time but for now, going back to the library it goes 
 This was really bad. I had to force myself to finish the first "feature film." I now realize why this only lasted a short time. There was really no point. Compared to the Clone Wars this was bantha poodoo 
 I returned this item, as it didn't fit my 19-pound Boston Terrier well at all. It was way too large for his body. "Small" obviously means small for a larger dog instead. Just be aware! 
 As another reviewer said in his 1-star review of this book, the sections on poker are excellent but they are buried inside of seemingly endless chapters on Ted Binion's murder, the author's grandparents, and all kinds of other nonsense.  While those subjects could possibly be fascinating, McManus isn't nearly good enough as a writer to make them interesting.  So what we're left with is a highly-compelling description of the 2000 WSOP for about 1/3rd of the book and then 2/3rds garbage.    Best avoided if you're looking for a poker book 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 I have loved this series from the beginning - great characters, fun stories, thrills and romance.  Very light, quick reads that are great entertainment.  This story was awful.  There were two mysteries.  One was wrapped up so quickly it was very unrewarding, and the other was so convoluted I didn't even get it.    A comment was made that one person, when convicted, wouldn't be around to hurt anyone any more. But this person wasn't even the perp for the big mystery.  And the epilogue? WHO was that person?  And how did they figure it out?  Too many holes for an otherwise easy read.    Finally, the characterization was off.  The normal comraderie between the girls was missing.  I felt no love from the original three for Yuki, in spite of her storyline.  If there's a sixth story, I hope it brings back some of the magic from the earlier books.  I'm giving this book two stars only because these characters are like old friends.  If I had just picked up the series with this book, it would be a one.  Sorry James 
 This snide little book purports to be pro-McCartney, while digging up every nasty little rumor and innuendo ever spoken by a "source."  Taking the tone of a knowing insider (we get the drift when he first mentions "Eppy," the Beatles' nickname for Brian Epstein, and used as though the author were "Eppy's" best friend, EWWW), the author unaccountably starts the book in 1980 when Paul was detained in Japan for possessing marijuana. Then it jumps around, meanders, uses lots and lots of slang words (just in case we think Sandford isn't hip) and finally ends with a triumphant attack on Paul's marriage (which was not over when the book was published).  Don't bother.  
 Oh Lord!! Does anyone still read this?? I was a subscriber back in the early 70's,when it was a folded up, newspaper.By and large, Jann Wenner let people run it, that knew how to. It is now, and has been nothing more than an Ad choked,gossiping Teen slick.Right, like they are the ones with the money!! I wonder what they still pay Raoul Duke, to do??!! Ralph Gleason has to be turning over in the grave 
 You do not *need* to give your children an allowance to teach them how to handle money. Really. The author's position is that you simply have to--and it makes you wonder if she also thinks it is okay to experiment with drugs in order to learn how to use them the "right" way.  Just as you can educate children about the dangers of drugs without giving them any, you can also educate children about how to spend money wisely. One way is to take them grocery shopping with you, for example, and let them help you with calculating the best values for the money you have.  Others have said this book is good for those with middle class incomes. I disagree. If there will be any possible future scenario where your child will have to work for a living in any capacity, they need to know that money is NOT just handed to them, and that money belongs to the person who earned it (and the spouse, in community property states), NOT the children. This means that children need to learn that some things you do without compensation as being part of the family (chores), and other things you do in exchange for money (outside jobs or special jobs around the house) or something else (bartering). In real life, money is not just handed to you, unless you're on welfare.  Someone has/had to earn that money at some point in time, and just handing money to someone will never educate them as to how to actually earn it.  This book might be okay for someone looking to leave their child a huge trust fund, where he or she just lives off the interest, but not for people trying to help their children truly make their own way in life 
 Another reviewer wrote that this album is great "massage music" and is therefore compatible with a state of relaxation.  And I sadly have to agree! If you're looking for energetic and rousing battle songs that testify to the courage of the ancient Scots, you're definitely NOT going to find it here.  These songs are utterly lacking in energy and inspiration.  It seems the New Age movement has emasculated even our proudest memories of ancient courage and valor.  This album is an insult to the memory of the brave kinsmen who struggled against many worthy adversaries to achieve dignity and freedom.  The lyrics reflect little more than self pity, and the music could not stand alone without the vocals as most of the "songs" do not even have a strong melody by themselves.  I was expecting some rousing music such as that found in the old tune called "Men of Harlech", a famous Welsh song that has been rewritten time and time again to inspire Her Majesty's warriors on to battle, as in the movie "Zulu", for example.  So if you want some bland bedtime music buy this album, but if you want to be inspired with the glories of Scotland, look elsewhere

 Imagine writing a book by simply stringing quotes and references together with your literary contribution limited to connecting verbs and you have this book in a nutshell!  Maybe I would have liked it if the author had titled it, Frontsoldaten: The book of quotes 
 I hated this book.  It is, from cover-to-cover, chock-full of cliches.  The faithful black family retainers; the silly, southern belle best friends; the wacky mother (Lavinia);the conflicted main character (Caroline).   I also found the book a little anti-semitic in that the most vile character in the book is Caroline's Jewish husband who tells her he will come to see her mother "after she's dead".  Caroline's brother, who treats his wife and children like second class citizens, however, is given all sorts of excuses for his behavior and given a pass on an affair, all the while Caroline is criticizing her husband for his sexual proclivities.  Ridiculous.  I thought Lavinia's illness was a cheap shot plot point to garner the reader's sympathy.  I just kept wishing for Lavinia to die already.  I also found that "yanh" southern dialect for "hear" EXTREMELY annoying, as it was on every other page.  It is mystifying to me that so many people gave this book 4 and 5 stars.  Evidently a great number of people have never read good literatur 
 In a "letter to the Editor" published in National Review Magazine of 3/24/89, I've already pointed out the blattant errors made by Mr. Winters in his article "They Shoot Allies, Don't They?"  published by the same magazine in its 11/25/88. Factual errors that he had  to recognize like: Ho Chi Minh was born in Hue, Thich Tri Quang was a  successful lawer, The HCM Trail was started in 1962, ... This book is a  development of that article and consequently the errors are even bigger.  Let's look at the book's most important question: Why did President Kennedy  wanted to replace President Diem, an ally of 9 years? To answer this  question correctly and completly, we have to look beyond Kennedy's  political ambition, beyond the election of 1964. To fully answer to this  question, Mr. Winters must also think of other questions: Why did the U.S.  support then stop the support to the Shah of Iran, Somoza, Noriega, Marcos,  ...? Beside other factors, the most important one is "THE WILL OF THE  PEOPLE" of Iran, of Nicaragua, of the Phillippines, of Vietnam. This  factor is totally absent from Mr. Winters' book. The only shadow of the  author's interest in the "people" is in the title of his book.  And I agree with the previous comentator that even "the year of the  hare" is, unknown to Mr. Winters, unapplicable to the Vietnamese. *  A  Vietnamese in Sacramento, California 
 Not only did this product have no effect on the manic barking of our own dogs, but the company also refused to provide a refund/replacement after the product arrived with a broken chunk out of the cheap plastic casing.  After sitting out in a rainstorm, the Super Bark Stop shorted out and is now totally worthless.  Find another product - You'll thank me later 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 Recently I completed teaching a seven week series on the sacraments. As I prepared my studies and made a short list of resources that I wanted to make available to those studying with me, I asked myself "Now, regarding baptism, what kind of book do I need?"   		What I needed was a single volume that constructs its case out of a close reading of the biblical data, that interacts with well-known objections in a clear but polite manner, and that sets forth the mainlines of covenant theology in such a way as to show how infant baptism properly belongs to that system and to the life of the Christian church. What I choose was The Case for Covenantal Baptism.   		Written by a number of respected pastors and professors serving in various Reformed and evangelical settings, The Case for Covenantal Baptism does not break new ground, but it does offer substantial discussions of key biblical passages (e.g. Mt.28:18-20; Ac.2:39; Rom.4:11-12; 6:3-6; Heb.8:11-12; Jer.31; et.al). Further, it places the discussion of paedo-baptism (and the debate surrounding it) firmly within the covenantal context of Scripture. While some differences among the contributing authors are evident, yet for the most part this volume is remarkably even and coherent. Certainly it does make a clear case for covenantal baptism as well as offering theological and pastoral insight on the place of children in the Old and New Testaments and in the congregation.  		Although there are now several good books on infant baptism available, yet I believe this articulate and constructive volume will be of benefit to pastors desirous of instructing their congregations in the sacraments. It will also be of value to seminary graduates heading into the pastorate and to continuing seminary students as a supplement to lectures. Finally, The Case for Covenantal Baptism should also prove helpful and therefore be appreciated by those studying this issue and endeavoring to make up their minds about the biblical validity of this precious practice.  
 Christopher Byron's sensibility indicates that he is a small-minded, pathologically envious little weasle of a man, who tries to puff up his empty meaningless life by attempting to denigrate a great woman who has brought great beauty and grace to our culture.  Unless you're one of those nasty-spirited people who find glee in joining the pack of hyenas who hate powerful, brilliant, talented women because the light from great women's souls is too bright and reveals too vividly your pathetic life, avoid this book. Byron is simply a mean little vampire, trying to suck money and notoriety from the life blood of Martha.  Shame on John Wiley & Sons for publishing this book 
 To anyone who has endured corporate life at a sub-executive level, the title of this book will be seen as a dead giveaway to the underlying motives of its authors and those to whom they pander.  The book's message? When one is too greedy a bastard to pay employees a fair wage, simply devise schemes that make them temporarily forget that they are being exploited.  Such short-term distractions allow the "chosen ones" to continue creaming off profits for themselves.  It doesn't take much time to figure out that there is a chasm between executive rewards (e.g., multi-million dollar payouts, regardless of performance) and the scattered bones thrown to an organization's "little people".

 Naturally, my hair is wavy, with very thin strands but piles and piles of it. My hair is somewhat difficult when it comes to straightening -- usually it looks fine when I leave the house, but comes completely undone after about four hours. So, when my last Conair straightener broke, I went out and invested my money in this one.  Overall, it's okay. It straightened my hair in one stroke, which is rare for me. However, it seemed to just suck all the moisture out of my hair, leaving it extremely dry and dull (which is definitely not good for a vegan such as myself, since my hair is already dry enough!). The movements were clumsy with this, and I occasionally snagged my hair or burned myself due to the plates unexpectedly shifting toward me. It didn't break, and it's still going just as strong as the day I first bought it.  This straightener had problems dealing with smaller amounts of hair, or the fine "baby hairs" around my forehead. And sadly, it couldn't keep my side bangs straight to save its life -- they were as wavy as ever two hours after I'd straightened it. This straightener does the most minimal job -- at least it straightens your hair somewhat -- but save your pennies for a straightener more worthwhile. 
 I certainly would not recommend this book to anyone as a first Kellerman's novel. There are too many medical jargons and terms as if Kellerman is trying to show off his medical knowledge. There are just too many unnecessary references to either the rarer or more serious and feared disorders unrelated to the story and thus causing a lot of side tracking which to me is a pure waste of time reading and boring to readers especially those with medical knowledge. It took me a long long time to finish this novel and thought of discarding it numerous times even when I was more than half way through the novel! This is especially so after having read the very exciting Robert Crais's "Demolition Angel" followed by Lee Child's "One Shot".  The story in this book are also full of loop holes and I cannot buy the idea of a Conspiracy Club using Jeremy to get to the killer and allowing more murders to take place while he was stressfully doing so. However, I must admit that I did enjoy reading a couple of Kellerman's other novels "Murder Book" & "When the Bough Breaks" quite some time ago 
 For the life of me, I cannot understand why this book and so many others completely fail to mention Commodore and it's contributions to the PC world. 1st millionth computer sold with VIC-20. Most computers ever sold with C64 (over 20 million!). First multitasking, etc. with Amiga. etc., etc... Commodore created the first, affordable home computer. They introduced computers to the masses. While Apple was trying to sell their Apple II series for astronomical prices, C64 was being sold for 1/3 - 1/5 the price.  I trully hope that in the end, the historical accounts of the birth of a personal computer will give credit where the credit is due - Chuck Peddle for creation of the 6502 processor, and Commodore for creation of the most sucesfull computer ever made - C64 
 Why? Because this book, as well as Universe in a Nutshell, and A Briefer History of Time, are nothing more than slightly modified versions of A Brief History of Time. Hawking provides nothing additional to what he's already published so don't waste your time & money.  
 I bought this book after having read a couple of Katzenbach's books that I really enjoyed. However, I found myself struggling to get through this book and skipping over large sections that just couldn't hold my interest. Bottom line, I wanted to like this book, but just couldn't 
 You think you are getting something to help assist you in linking yourself with the beyond, but you are in all actuality getting something that reads more like something being explained that the author doesnt really believe instead.  I love Konstatinos' other books, but this one left a bad taste in my mouth 
 I saw this film recently.  It generated a lot of laughter from the audience, but - generally - this was laughter for all the wrong reasons.  All of the actors are sort of porn star good looking and, sadly, have a commensurate acting ability.  In particular the actor with the awful "Australian" accent is particularly wooden.  The story is pretty boring, although there are a few witty one liners and almost amusing situations, but overall this is just not a very good film.  It's not even bad enough to be in the category of so bad it's good.  I really wonder how films like this can get made - and more than that I wonder why they generally get so many glowing reviews on Amazon - are all the positive reviews by friends and relatives of the filmmakers? 
 I ordered 16 bandanas at the last minute for my dance team's competition, but I only received 12 in the mail.  The packing slip said 16 and I was charged for the 16.  It was too late for me to order more and the color was too rare for me to find in the stores.  Would have given only 1 star but at least they sent it to me on time. 
 Purchased for my daughter, an English teacher, Scrabble lover. She said she'd rather have a book to look up words and most of the features on the Franklin she'd never use and thought they took away from the mental challenge of the game. She said it would end up on a shelf in her house. She'd rather have a paperback Scrabble Dictionary. I returned the Franklin. She didn't even like the idea of taking it to school for her kids to use when she lets them play Scrabble in class 
 Strange Candy is a collection of 14 short stories by Laurell K. Hamilton, author of the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter and Merry Gentry novels.  The first story in the book, "Those Who Seek Forgiveness" is, as Laurell puts it, "the first time Anita ever walked on paper for me." I hate to say it, but it's not that great a story. This is obviously Anita Blake Mark I. The character traits that would make Anita something special, the wit, the vicious sense of humor, the repressed sexuality, are nowhere in evidence - because they didn't yet exist in the author's mind.  Many readers will be shocked to discover "Those Who Seek Forgiveness" was the template for much of Laurell's short novel Micah. I said good things about Micah upon its release. I would have been less impressed had I known how much of it was a retread. The basic plot of Anita being hired by a murderer to raise the zombie of their victim, the zombie breaking free of Anita's control to attack their killer, Anita flung through the air to crack her head on a gravestone, being knocked unconscious, waking up at the end of the story in a hospital bed after her client's death, all were lifted from "Those Who Seek Forgiveness".  The rest of the stories are mostly forgettable, about half-and-half not-very-fantastic fantasy and not-very-horrible horror. There's a reason Laurell K. Hamilton is not known as a great short story writer: she isn't. Overall her characters are cardboard, she hasn't the gift of sketching a believable, sympathetic personality in the few strokes allowed within a short story's limited word count. There's rarely a sense of real peril involved in the problems her characters face. The stories come across as unsatisfying, by-the-numbers exercises in which "people" you don't care about go through the motions of adventures that don't involve.  One irritating thing about the stories in Strange Candy, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the order in which they're presented. For instance, there are two stories starring Sidra Ironfist set in Laurell's Nightseer universe. But why the hell is Sidra's first-ever appearance presented **after** the follow-on story?  We're almost through the book before we hit a real winner, "Here Be Dragons". And Here Be One Hell of a Story. It's shocking, after wading through so much dreck, to suddenly hit one of the neatest, most vicious little psychological horror pieces I've ever experienced. It's like reading the work of a completely different writer. If every story in Strange Candy was of the quality of "Here Be Dragons" this would be a 5 star collection.  "Winterkill" which is also set in the Nightseer world, is, surprisingly, pretty darn good. Other than "Here Be Dragons" it's the only decent story in the collection, in my opinion. I found myself liking and rooting for main character Jessa - which, considering she's basically a killer-for-hire is a great accomplishment on the writer's part.  Strange Candy is bookended by two Anita Blake tales. It begins ith "Those Who Seek Forgiveness" and ends with "The Girl Who Was Infatuated With Death" which takes place within continuity just before the novel Narcissus in Chains. As with so many recent Laurell K. Hamilton tales, "TGWWIWD" has a great set-up. Anita is hired to find a girl who is (a) dying of bone cancer and will in fact have her leg cut off in a few days, (b) about to be "turned" by a vampire, that very night, mostly so she can avoid the mutilation and painful death by cancer awaiting her otherwise. Problem: she's underage to legally make that choice. If the vampire turns her, he'll be up for execution. Does Anita "save" the girl from being turned - which legally is what she should do - knowing that by doing so she's condemning her to mutilation and, in short order, real death, or should she let it happen, knowing she's condemning the vampire? This presents Anita with a no-good-choices serious moral dilemma.  Unfortunately the great set-up soon gives way to zero forward momentum as the focus turns to - you guessed it - Anita's sex life. An over-emphasis on this one facet of Anita's life to the exclusion of plot has ruined every recent Anita Blake story, and it's no exception here. Thus, instead of bending all her efforts to finding the girl and the vampire in the few hours she has left, instead Anita spends the time playing footsy with Jean-Claude in his office at Guilty Pleasures while the police and other vampires do the job for her. Even Jean-Claude comments, "There was a time, ma petite, that you would have insisted on riding to the rescue yourself, questioning the girl's friend, and refusing to bring in the police at all." At which point I could not help but think, "Yeah, and wouldn't that be fun to read? There was a time this story would actually have been good."  Recommended for Anita Blake completists who absolutely need to own every word ever written about the character. Recommended for "Here Be Dragons" and "Winterkill". For myself this is a library rental, nothing more - a collection of mediocre short stories that just happens to contain one absolutely killer piece and one pretty good 
 This book is only ok. It has many shortfalls, including the metric and food issues mentioned in other reviews. After trying this despite its shortcommings, I moved on. I would recommend the Foundation Diet. Though its not ment specifically for PCOS'ers, it has put me on tract, helped with hair issues and made me feel generaly better. I have lost some weight as well. If you do try Pcos Diet Book, be sure your measuring cups have metric 
 I have always had a morbid fascination with that segment of the population that believes that the Bible is the only book one has to read, and that great literature consists entirely of the Left Behind series.  I bought this movie to get a sense of this group.  Banal is the kindest word I can find for this tripe.  Third rate actors, low-rent science fiction backdrops, and completely out of touch with reality.  The movie opens with the Israeli agricultural "miracle."  What it does not tell the audience is that Israel would be a dead state if it were not for the 20% of the Israeli government's budget funded by US taxpayers through the US Government's very unwise investment in this apartheid regime (see Jimmy Carter's new book) and if it were not for the blatant Israeli underground pipes that are literally looting the Arab aquifers at long range and from way beneath the earth.  Israeli agriculture is not a miracle, it is a travesty--it consumes 50% of all the water used in Israel, and produces less than 5% of the Gross Domestic Product.  The movie goes downhill from there.  Just to place it in a proper religous movie context, if the "Ten Commandments" was a perfect 10, this movie is no more than a 1 and certainly not even close to a 2 
 The actors spend too much time just staring at each other without speaking. The story is too unbelievable too. It was a waste of my money to buy it. 
 I thought that this book was very short on actual, useful data. It seems that it could be boiled down to about 20 good pages to get the pertinent information across to the reader and dispense with the "this is the best book in the world" hard sell. The physiology was only mildly interesting as I just wanted the "program"-give me the workout and let me decide if it works or not and spare me the anatomy and physiology lessons 
 Me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater. I ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull. After about a half hour my friend, who tends to be more "progressive" than I, actually suggested we leave. It was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing. Ever!  Perhaps I'm biased. However I highly recommend that no one get this movie. The only reason I can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant. I tend to lean to the right, but even I was entertained by V For Vendetta, despite it being blatant liberal propaganda. If you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil, at least make it interesting 
 Too much emphasis on her voice and not enough to songwriting dooms this set. Some of the tracks were so dull and lifeless. I've heard more passion, more joie de vivre from lounge singers in casinos. Yes, she sounds like Sade. I will say that I liked the one song she sang in French. I think I would have upped this album an additional star if the entire album were recorded not in English. 
 How sad it is read such a poorly written and conceived book about such an interesting subject!  This book is a tragic waste of wonderful material.  I hope that another biographer with greater literary skills decides to take  on Armand Hammer 
 I hope her knowledge of American Indian culture is sounder than her grasp of English history. I spotted some howlers, several repeated in the text: King James "VII" of Scotland (make that James VI) was NOT Queen Elizabeth's nephew. Nor was Queen Elizabeth England's first Protestant monarch (the honours go to her brother Edward VI) I could go on, but you get the idea ... Read this one with a heaping tablespoonful of sal 
 This may only be my opinion, but I've gone to therapy in the past so I feel I can compare this book with what would be discussed in a professional office.  The info in this book is not new or innovative.  It sheds no new light on the situation.  It may give insight to someone who has never read a book about anxiety/depression before or is suffering a mild depression not requiring any professional intervention.  I would recommend it to someone who has mild ephisodes of anxiety.    Unfortunately I could not relate to Lucinda's experiences of riding on a plane or giving a dinner party.  I believe if you are suffering a depression or anxiety and it is more serious than the two examples above, her advice is much to general to help at all 
 I'd like to think most Floridians know not to get too exhausted out in the heat and drink lots of water but this book takes the time to spell that out for you. Finding a shady spot for midday gardening is great advice if you have a shade garden, otherwise, you're gardening wherever your plants happen to be.  This trivial  information really grated on my nerves and is what earned it just two stars.  The lack of pictures is a big disadvantage especially when the author decides to use common as opposed to botanical names.   I find Home Depot even uses different names from week to week on certain plants and it's impossible to determine just what is being talked about without a botanical reference. The calendar was a little disappointing as that was the main reason for buying this book. I can find something useful in any gardening book so it does have some value, it's just not what I was looking for 
 The schematization of 'ineffable qualities' into a how to book.  I find this deeply essentially offensive - if it were only idiotic I wouldn't care. To take what is probably the most sophisticated and subtle and DIFFICULT mind-unset ever expressed on this planet and reduce it to formulas, slogans and 'decorative schemes'.  If you read this book and 'get so much out of it' and 'apply it with marvelous results to your daily life' or 'learn to accept imperfection in myself and others' you will probably not have a clue to what I'm saying. 
 Trust me. I went through many Exchange server books and I am an experienced system admin and Exchange admin. This book is the worst book for technical people. The concept in the book is for readers who are most likely a non-technical managers who want to have an overall knowledge about Exchange. If you touch Exchange server, do not read this book and waste your time. Go with Exchange 24/7 which is much better 
 The author clearly has a problem with men.  Most of the book reads like a collection of the author's opinions and rants.  The arguments are circular and redundant.  I stopped a little over halfway through the book because I was weary from reading the same statements over and over.  
 I have to admit that I gave up on this book.  I'm hoping to find a more readable biography of Mrs. Roosevelt.  Cook's style and grammar are just too jumbled for me.    Look in the "look inside this book" section here and go to page 14.  This is a prime example of Cook's overuse of quotes.  I appreciate that she did her research, but if she was going to quote so much, she should have just included one whole article.  As it is, the whole page is a mish-mash of sentances and words taken from various sources creating a confusing unreadable mess.   
 What does Mr. Riley have against bunnies?  I read this book in the bookstore and found it disturbing. The truth is bunnies don't contemplate suicide but sick people contemplate killing helpless animals. Perhaps thats where the ideas stem in this book. I'm asking the bookstore to remove this book from its shelves. It is a sick and cruel attempt at humor. It belongs in the same wastebasket as the "roadkill" candy. 
 Abandoning the reinterpretation of the initial epoch of Batman, like the previous writings of THE LONG HALLOWEEN and DARK VICTORY, HUSH instead is a tale set in the modern era. The plot concerns the arrival of a new villain and the supposed control of the insane criminal base of Gotham City. The Dark Knight must work to end the transgression that seems to be rapidly spiralling out of control.   The story begins as a simple kidnap and ransom story, that appears to be only a fraction of a greater crisis playing out behind the scenes, eventually turning into a mass profusion of ideas and set pieces without proper relevance or connection. The denouement is inauthentic, where it's fragmented and composed of distracting slack subplots largely unnecessary to the thematic undercurrent. Rather than follow through on the normal writing design of problem - reaction - resolution, the plot advancement has Batman continually reacting. A villain is introduced, generating the requisite fight scene that unfolds over an entire issue. This technique carries on until all the A list villains appear. It keeps the readers' mind disengaged from the "mystery" with its barrage of moments that provoke the certain, predictable appeal from the readership. HUSH ultimately becomes out of control throughout the plot development in its intent on being an epic, all defining book with its features of shocking moments and revelations. That trick has an overall numbing experience as the writing never recovers from the numerous blows to its credibility from the revisionist writing method.  The obvious mystery at the core is a simple pretext to affix a lingering, indulgent plot to the city's criminal element, ensuring that numerous revered characters are on display, the narrative never addresses or justifies the illogical, unexplained behavior of the characters. Rather than constructing a contemplative mystery worthy of Batman's abilities, the character is rewritten without the strong awareness and detective instinct, his character arc severely undermined as a result.  Overall, Hush never feels like a sincere attempt at storytelling. Where it differs from Halloween and Victory timewise, the revisionism and borrowed themes that characterized past writings are conspicuously promoted throughout the work with the same undisciplined methods. The book labors beneath redundancy and re-examination of ideas and passages already demonstrated, following the similar formula of those aforementioned works. It lacks inner consistency of the recent treatment of the world, and it fails to reconfigure its limited concept to place well within the current framework of the character. It doesn't attempt to explore the limits of the medium, but one entirely content to reside within its past conventions. Barely acceptable as an entertaining diversion 
 My first Nora Roberts' book....with only be persistent did I complete the book....found it to be very slow paced with an unrealistic storyline...shallow characterizatio 
 MUST READ REVIEW: The Free Speech Haters (lefties) have deleted this review Twice.  Robert Reich, was Bill Clintons scariest appointment. His ideology, ergo his politics has been the of the most extreme left of any Bill Clinton's appointments. And some may argue that he some of the most extreme viewpoints of ANY high level appointment.   Robert Reich and his ilk were very happy when from the 1940's - 1980, radical lefties was setting the public agenda. All items were in play, courts were stacked and extremist's legislatures abdicated their law making ability to the courts. The executive branch simply turned a blind eye when radical lefties created a false impression that they were supporting the constitution when in fact they were and still are systematically undermining it. Left-Wing views that were on the fringe of the Democratic Party in the Sixties and Seventies are now center stage. These views, being forwarded by people like Reich, Dean, Kerry and Feingold, seem accepted as normal.   Left Wingers - control the media, academia, the sciences, think-tanks, and for most of the last century the executive, judicial and legislative branch. Republicans were demoralized, but the pendulum has finally begun to swing the other way. People are finally getting fed up with the extremist left who is arrogantly opposed to honest intellectual debate for they are fervently certain that they are correct in all matters. Their disdain for discourse and for anybody who challenges them is extant.  But the worst part is that radical lefties are uncivil to the extreme. They fill the public airwaves and bookstores with nastiness. Listen to Air America or watch a Michael Moore DVD. Read their editorials and you will find vicious vituperative attacks. Open a leftist political best-seller and you find more mean spirited screeds. Extremist lefties, RAD-COMS (Radical Communists) typically reduce political debate to nonsensical statements that seem to be making point but are nothing but vague and angry assertions, unsupported by facts.  But what we're now witnessing is something far more corrosive of civic life than normal political vitriol: It's viciousness directed toward anyone holding a view other than the prevailing elitist left-wing propaganda. Insults also calculated to belittle and ridicule entire groups or judged to be different are part of the divisive wedge that lefties like to play in hurting the cohesiveness of the nation.  The Conservative tradition values free speech and debate. No one should be deterred from speaking his or her mind for fear of offending some group. Lefties are opposed to this idea, the shouting down of Ann Coulter the attacks on Christians, etc, etc. Are all handiworks of the left. It is their mean-spirited trash talk that fills their protge's with this HATE and ANGER of anybody not like them.  I'm sorry Mr. Reich, I used to be one of these lefties, and I know the condescension with which I was taught to look at people on the right. The attacking of American Citizens rather than ideas, the smearing of whole segments of society for some perceived ills against our ideology. This is leftism at its base. Fear and Hate driven. No. Mr. Reich it will be a sad day when you and your type WIN America. People are waking up, they are realizing that the great Democratic Party of yesteryear has been hijacked by Radicals.   Your book speaks about morals but you never discuss where the morals come from. Conservative position comes from a bedrock of factual and historical facts. They are a clear-eyed view of where America is and where we need to go. Your left wing morals come from a modernist philosophy, blown by the wind and proven to be a disaster. You biggest moral imperative is to BLAME others but that is what happens when you are ideologically based rather than historically and fact based.  I could go on and on, but MR. Reich, I used to be on the left. But the divisiveness, hate, anger, name-calling, utter compliance with leadership, no dissention, no debate, and supreme arrogance drove me away. Once one is away and in the middle you look at the two competing political thoughts and it is scary, very scary to see what you once were.   Mr. Reich, I am not an automaton, and that is what you need to usher in your America. What the conservatives need, is open honest debate, free speech, and equal time. You have a fight on your hands, one that I am hoping for my children's sake that you lose. 
 I must agree with Liz's review.  Robert A. Heinlein might have enjoyed seeing his name and legacy bantered about in this novel, but this book had nothing to do about Heinlein except the use his name as a "hook" to catch unsuspecting fish (like me).   Once again I'm reminded that you can't judge a book by it's cover and in this instance by it's title as well.     
 Sandra Betzina is wonderfully talented when it comes to garment contstruction.  I have several of her books and love them.  However, her expertise and creativity do not seem to extend to home sewing. The projects in this book are not inspiring. The fabric choices are questionable.  It is difficult to glean the 'tricks of the trade' as this book is organized entirely by project, not technique.  Save your money.  If you are truly interested, check it out from the library before you invest in this publication 
 To tell you the truth, I couldn't make heads nor tails out of this book.  The language is too far away from even modern, and the characters are confusing.  I love sci-fi, even the new computer-oriented (some call it cyberpunk) stuff like "Snow Crash", but "Synners" is just strange.  Ala the Emperor's New Clothes..."Oh my, how strange!  It must be good!"  No, sorry, it's just strange.  I actually came here (to Amazon reviews) to see if anybody else had made sense of it.  I thought I might read farther if I understood it better.  I'm only to page 18, and I doubt I'll finish it. Dou 
 a boy gets the worlds deadiest snake by mistake from a pet store???? huh what pet store is going to get the killer anyway but that is just the first of so many plot holes that i won't even talk about any others . just a fine cast wasted in this thrillesss non scary horror/suspence movie. a compleate mess and a waste of time 
 I sat down to read about this after hearing about it for years, and I want my week back. It only took that long because I had to push myself to finish it.  SPOILERS AHEAD: Meggie and Father Ralph (who everyone always seems to refer to as Ralph de Bricassart, even when they're talking to him) meet when he is twenty-six and Meggie is...ten. She speaks, acts and thinks like a 5-year-old, though. As the years go by, Father Ralph de Bricassart becomes sort of a father figure to little Meggie, and she develops a girlish crush on him. As Meggie is also "developing a very feminine figure," Ralph comes to love her in return but realizes that their love can never be. They discuss this in approximately fifteen thousand "Don't love me, my darling, for I love you but you know our love is forbidden and can never be" conversations throughout the book. Finally, after years of smothering their passion, they do it. In a really very boring scene that's all inner ruminating and blurred descriptions. And wouldn't ya know it, she gets pregnant. Ralph de Bricassart realizes (again) that their love can never be, and leaves. Meggie has his baby, and capers about gleefully that she's "stolen" something back from God. But wouldn't ya know it, the kid (who's as angelic and one-dimensional a boy I've ever encountered in literature) decides to be a priest. So she sends him to Father Ralph de Bricassart for training, who--get this--is so totally brain dead that IT NEVER ONCE OCCURS TO HIM THAT THIS MIGHT BE HIS CHILD!!!!!!! Apparently arithmetic is not a compulsory part of training for the priesthood; this guy also misses an incredibly broad hint from Meggie, when even the other priests figure it out. The Big Secret finally does come out (again in a very brief, anticlimactic scene) toward the end, but by then we're too busy skimming to really care.  All this leaves out a great many things--including immortal dialogue that makes Meggie sound perpetually ten years old ("I'll tell you something else about your roses, Ralph de Bricassart--they've got nasty, hooky thorns!"), endless, heavyhanded symbolism (ashes of roses, thorn birds...we get it! we get it!), some dumb subplot concerning a brother who is absent for 90% of the book, and one of the most unintentionally hilarious "tragic" scenes I've ever read (death by pig). Yet the Ralph-and-Meggie storyline really is the only major thing going on. And we never really get to see what it is that draws these two people together. I was expecting other subplots and development of other characters, and this never really happened. Many of the other relationships were sketchy and/or very confusing: Meggie's cruel judgment of her daughter Justine as a "monster" and a "b* tch," for example, seemed to have no basis. The last third or so involves Meggie making peace with her mother and daughter, and it just doesn't matter. The quick "the end" wrap-up would have been an even greater letdown if I'd still cared by that point. Even the most developed characters are flat and lifeless, and thoroughly unlikable. Scarlett O'Hara was selfish, but she was fun; these people are selfish and boring. Sickly-sweet quasi-romantic trash. 
 I found this book to be very disappointing.  All this book basically is is interviews with doctors and patients in regards to different treatment alternatives.  If you are trying to TREAT fibromyalgia, i definitely do not recommend this book.  If you really want someones gripes and groans about fibromyalgia you can get that point of view FREE on line on Fibromyalgia web sites.  If you want alternative treatments options- try The Fibromyalgia Nutrition Guide, although this book is all about nutrition, it is very easy to us and very helpful- All us fibromyalgics know about homeopathic stuff already such as massage and Alternative Treatments just reiterates that and has patients and doctor points of view on Massage, Chiropractic care, Etc... 
 Self indulgent, purile, child-like, pure unadulterated garbage of the highest order.  A truly horrible movie.  
 The Russian nuclear powered, missile carrying (SSBN) submarine K-219 was about 15 years old when it nearly triggered either WWIII or a 2nd Chernobyl.  In 1986, with Chernobyl still in minds of the public, and the Reagan/Gorbachev summit in Reykjavik imminent, the navies of both sides of the cold war sail SSBN's off each other's shore.  Floating platforms loaded with numerous missiles - some with multiple warheads - these subs are almost as dangerous to their crews as they are to the enemy.  In the case of K-219, the balance shifted firmly against the crew.  Poor design, construction and shipyard maintenance had prematurely aged the sub launched only a few years earlier than the first 688-class American subs.  Near Bermuda, K-219 was nearly sunk by a missile explosion caused by leaking seawater.  With one tube already deactivated because of seawater problems on a prior cruise, this was not a new problem.  In this case however, the explosion nearly sinks the then submerged boat, then floods it with toxic and corrosive gas.  Problems increase when the ships two reactors suffer a loss-of-coolant accident and nearly meltdown.  Echoing the experience of K-19, some brave crewmen sacrifice themselves to shut the reactors down.  Complications ensue when superiors in Moscow order the crew (once safely evacuated to a nearby freighter) to re-board the poisoned ship.  An American sub with a maverick commander adds to the danger when he runs his ship too near the stricken sub, apparently ordered to keep K-219 from being recovered.  Eventually, the ship will sink, and Captain Britanov will have to return home and answer to his superiors for the loss of the sub.  The loss of K-219 is a fascinating story, but unfortunately this book doesn't do it justice.  The cause of the book's numerous flaws is the author's determination to write it as if it were a novel, in which the facts, if not complete, are still single-minded.  That is, despite an extensive bibliography, there's only one version of the account.  Rather than document possible disputes over what happened, or why people act the way they did, "Hostile waters" offers a single, linear perspective, one with easily identifiable heroes and villains (the political officer is singled out for unpopularity even before he grabs the first lifeboat off K-219 - since he does nothing throughout the story he's an easy target).  This is not only a monumental cheat, but also robs the reader of critical facts - such as what really caused the ship to sink as it did; also the circumstances surrounding the apparently feckless captain of the American sub, and whether any blame should attach to Britanov for not knowing of the leaking missile tube or the painful domestic situation of the officer directly responsible for monitoring it.  "Hostile Waters" reads like a novel - a very unrealistic one 
 This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny. 
 At the beginning, the author states that she is taking some liberties with characters, etc., the usual things authors do in order to better tell the story. No issue there.  It can't be later than 1941 in the book when Moroccan forces invade and devastate a Black Forest village that the family has left just the day before. Now there were in fact Moroccan and Algerian forces attached to the French forces, but the invasion of Germany proper began end of 1944/beginning of 1945. It would have been that much later that Moroccans attacked anything in Germany. In WWII, the entire war changed in the meantime.  That does not take away anything from God's work and protection and the family's faith which is inspirational (albeit, sometimes more focused on the being an Adventist than a follower of Jesus Christ). However, taking liberties to the point that the personal story disconnects from history in general does more damage to the story than simplify anything.   I have not finished the book yet, and while the story itself has me curious about the rest, I wonder whether I would find more inaccuracies. I understand that such a story is hard to tell in all details, but when there are obvious things that are wrong, you are left wondering a bit 
 i collect cookbooks and do a lot of experimenting with recipes.  every dish i've made from this book has had a strange, unappetizing flavor.  i've just ruined a $30 piece of lamb, so i don't plan to cook from this book again 
 For the times this movie was made, the acting is good. I would love to see this same story done in more modern times where I believe the acting would be less in the dramatic style and seem more real to life. If you've read the book, this movie cuts out so much of what I loved in the book. I wish not only that it would be done in modern times but I can see it being done in a trilogy style to capture all the interaction of characters and the essence of the story would be more complete. If you have to choose between the book and the movie, choose the book 
 On Tuesday November 30, 1982 I had just come home from a scout meeting, and I turned on the television, and not knowing what was on my father got all hyper, and told me to turn it off, and I didn't even know the name of this. I looked it up in the TV Guide later on, and unfortunately, due to the fact that I was still shaken up by the other night I didn't dare share the name due to the fact I'd get a sermon. I was at a crucial age in my life where I was 15 where I had desires for girls, but emotionally I was not prepared for them. I can understand the fact that it's a morally bankrupt film, and was capturing the fact of the free-sexual revolution, but I don't see the connection considering that it was always burning since the world's been turning, but our parents put thier hands over thier ears if we were to tell them that. I guess looking back my parents argument is "There's a time and place for everything", but guess what that would've been a perfect time to help me understand. I know that a few months later that I brought it up to my aunt who's a committed Christian, and she paled, which led up to the sermon, and to be honest I felt like I couldn't win. I feel with this movie I had to not let it go until I got to see it because it was important for me to see it in it's entirety, and I didn't get to see this until I was 20, and I brought it back up to my parents as my father's friend had just opened a video store in Cherry Hill, NJ., and the battle started again. I have felt like a eunich I didn't get to watch this movie all this time, and when I did I found it rather appealling, and now wanted to add it to my collection I was getting flack as I actually bought the blank video, and tried to get it copied onto the videotape. Looking back I would've been better off just buying it, but I know I have to wonder if I would've come to same conclusion. I got the tape finally when I was 25 years old, and watched it once, and since then I lost the appeal. I saw it from a different light that my college professor was showing it from. I didn't focus on the colors, or the scene where Ben was looking into the goldfish bowl after being dumped by Elaine, and thrown out of a campus because of the fact that Mrs. Robinson took away Ben's virginity, and this was when Ben was trying to get together with Elaine. I found this to be coincidental, but rather truthful when I had a woman make a phone call one night when I was working in a convience store, and it was a rather seductive one, and then the woman just turned it off when I finally met her kind of like Mrs. Robinson doing it to Ben, and especially when he was in too deep. The fact that this happened could've been an alternative lesson my father could've taught me if he didn't want to talk about the sexual nature. With this mindset I don't own this anymore, and have no inclination, or intention of owning it again. I can't honestly say if I bought the tape instead of waiting for the blank copy that it would've made a difference. I feel that once I saw the fact that Mrs. Robinson made a blank promise to make Ben happy for the rest of his life it just ruined it for me. This is where the sexual revolution tone takes over as no one would've ever suspected a woman would be a seducer because men are supposed to, or it's implied that it's a man's job to have an affair, but that's the world's standard, and morally it's wrong for either side to cheat on one another. It left me feeling that I wasn't worth the time to talk about this movie to, and about the way the relationships in the movie, and made to feel dirty because I wanted to know, and angry that I had to repress myself, and my feelings, and my character to fit this model that pleased my family. I just feel that it was more worth if you are really wanting to see this movie just buy it, and not worry about your parents helping you. Mind you it is a PG rating, so anyone 13 and under not without a parent. 
 Jack Nicholson is wasted in this movie. He doesn't get to be JACK, he just plays a watered down characature of himself. But the worst aspect of the movie is the very basis of the story. Sandler's character keeps getting set up and as a viewer you keep wanting a payoff, a reprisal, but the point of the movie is that his character won't do it. So you have a buildup of tension throughout the movie followed by a weak and rushed attempt at a payoff. The movie should have been dumped in the first draft stage.  I chuckled at 3 throwaway gags in the film; the rest of the time I kept looking at my watch wondering when it would be over 
 The relationships between the various characters weren't convincing and I failed to connect to the main character, Lottie, at all.  The book seemed to ramble on, and didn't catch my interest.  There were a few parts where the action picks up, but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness 
 This book was given to me by my family on the request of my wife.  She and my family are religious and I am not.  I read this with an open mind however it simply frustrated me.  The author attempts to provide reinforcement to what I consider Western Christianity (WC) views, but the use of false logic, wild assumptions, and circular arguments simply make no case at all.  I have more questions now after reading this poor attempt to explain WC.  For instance, in Chapter two the author uses extremely poor logic and nothing but philisophical rant to "prove" God exists.  There is no proof in the chapter.  However, later in the book Geiser and Brooks build on this faulty foundation established in Ch. 2 to attempt to exlpain other mysteries of religion.  I am sorry, but in my opinion that is a poor defense - weak foundations make weaker structures.  This book is clearly designed for those who are already strong beleivers in a faith, not fact-based religion.  I was hoping it would provide answers to some of the questions I have about Christianity, however I was greatly disappointed.    If you are a strong Christian then this book may be of some help when people ask you the tough questions, but I doubt any skeptics will be converted with this poor defense manual 
 I purchased this unit a few weeks ago, and it's been trouble ever since.  I think I managed to get one decent cup of coffee out of it, but not as good as my old fashioned percolator.  I read all of the instructions, I read the tips, especially regarding using a coarse grind, but 90% of the times I used this, the coffee would stay in the top vessel for hours.  Of course, with the great vacuum created, there was no way to separate the two pieces until the pressure equalized, leaving a top-heavy, unstable vacuum inside cheap, thin glass; a disaster waiting to happen.  Well, it finally happened.  After attempting yet again to get a cup of coffe out of this thing, using the coarsest grind I could find, the liquid again remained "stuck" in the upper vessel.  So I left it to cool, thinking it would eventually  equalize on its own.  After about 1-1/2 hours, all but about 10-15% of the liquid had moved to the bottom vessel.  Since I had already used my electric drip machine to get my morning coffe and I did not want to be late for work, I decided to go about my morning rituals.  While in the shower, I heard a loud noise from the kitchen.  Upon entering the kitchen, I was horrified to see coffee and glass EVERYWHERE.  Coffe dripping from the range hood, splattered on walls, ceiling, cabinets, and appliances over 5 feet away, and glass shrapnel in other rooms over 8 feet away.  I can only be thankful nobody was in the room when this happened.  Since not evan I could believe what I was looking at while I was actually looking at it, I decided to take a few pictures.  I will be making these available for all to see in the near future.  I will attempt to include a link in a future review.  So now I have to spend most of the day, missing work, cleaning this abominable mess.  Oh, by the way, coffee stains so I'll probalby have to re-paint the kitchen.  If you buy this product, I would highly recommend the following accessories:  1 - A good HMO (just in case) 2 - Safety goggles as a minimum precaution 3 - A "frequent flyer" card from your favorite local coffee house, where you should be able to get a decent cup 
 From a military viewpoint, this story is not even close to believable. From a liturature viewpoint, this book has simple sentence structure, simple character development, and very basic dialog.  This novel seams to  have been thought of and written on a weekend holiday.  Previous reviews  mentioned this book as a freshman level read and that is a good description  of the subject content 
 This book is just plain hateful, mean and nasty. The humor is of South Park IQ level. If you laugh at talking poop, you will probably think this is funny.  I'm keeping the book because I enjoy the pictures (that is, the ones that are reasonably well reproduced). Were the 70's tacky? Yes. Were they fun? YES. Lighten up Lileks. It's ok to have fun. What is your decor? Victorian? Now that's laughable! 
 This is not what I expected or wanted.  The book is written for business senarios with very few suggestions of a personal nature.  The description of the book does not indicate that it is mainly for business use 
 Most of what was in the book, is other books I've read on Hillary.  Articles mixed in with the rest of the book made it a little difficult to enjoy reading.  
    O.K. I didn't buy the book, but I searched for reference to "immortality", which, as I suspected would give a very concise philisophical snapshot of the author. Lets see now, he speaks of the "demographic" problems associated with longer life and lower firtility. First obvious flaw in his reasoning is that we would be marginally active and retire for the last 40 to 50 or so years of a radically extended life(or 1000 years or so). The premise is rediculous because the goal of adult onset gene doping would be to extend health and vitality. Immaging a world in which you could live to 150 years or so with the strength and clearity of a 40 or 30 year old? Are you going to just "sit down in your rocking chair"?      Even going with the worker ratios, in Japan for instance that he speaks of, only 2 for every 1 retired, we could adjust the theory that social security operates-if you retire at age 65 with indefinite life span, you should collect for just 20 years-go back to work, start a business. Go back to school-learn something new-all better ideas than just infering that we should just roll over and die because redical life extension might cause some potential "problems" with systems put in place when humans were suffering and dying at young ages.     Also, "age differences" between the developed world and the underdeveloped world. Yes, there will be definate philosophic differences but they exist for other reasons rather than just "older women"(refering to aging populations that will have a slight increase in female to male ratios) in the North and "younger men"(refering to a higher male to female ratio in younger populations-as well as selective gender bias) in the South, or underdeveloped world. Maybe the influence an older, somewhat more femine population in the West might be a moderating influence governing our policies with regard to the rest of the world? Just a thought. But-waite a minute! Life extension will be available to the men as well as the women, unless we find more men just wanting to "roll over and die".        Mr Fukuyama seems to be saying that changing anything that "makes us human" is wrong.       I have a question to pose to him and any of you out there.      What is so good about being "human"? Lets see, we are a vehicle for the "The Selfish Gene" which only cares about its transmission from one temporary entity to the next-and after the age of reproduction-who cares? Right? So we are disposable!Birth-Shcool-Work-Reproduction-Death. Right about when we start to begin to live, the genetic time bomb begins to visabley manifest itself.       Like Francis, I was born in the middle of the "Baby Boom" generation. I am looking forward to human intellegence being able to preserve precious consciousness indefinitley. I have always known it would happen and I have a better than 50% chance at seeing this. This was considered impossible 30 years ago and I (and others like me) would state this and be shrugged off. What is really of concern to me is that now, we know it is possible but that some believe we should just "roll over and die"! Rediculous! We should persue radical life extension and also encourage near zero total birth rates so we can escape the Birth-School-Work-Reproduction-Death senerio!  
 There's nothing wrong with the performance: it's Gershwin himself, according to the editorial review, taken from a piano roll. "Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound Reality" it says on the packaging.  All I can say is, it's a thin excuse for a surround-sound DVD-Audio disc: the one track is the only thing on it. Maybe 15 minutes, total, though nowhere on the disc or its packaging does it mention the track list or the timing. Or that it's remastered from a piano roll, for that matter. And all at a premium price? You've got to be kidding!  Watch out for the entire DVD-Audio series by Alexander Goldberg Jero. I bought several, to fill out my DVD-Audio collection, and none have lived up to expectations 
 If you can possibly avoid it, don't buy this book.  If you can't possibly avoid it, remember to use the internet.  The internet is 3000 times better at things than this book is.  Also, realize that even the problems in this book have continuous typos so if your TA grades you as wrong, check to make sure you are doing the same problem their solution book solved.  I wish we could rate this book without a star 
 It tells me 'no device to download to'.  Amazon, debug your product before you take people's money!! You are acting like Microsoft.  There is no way to report this to Amazon. Does anybody there care anymore? 
 "Sins and Needles" reflects the current state of our American society:  it's okay to go bad, be bad, turn it all around and go on to make money from it.  There are many folks who have lived a normal life without all the theatrics achieved by Raymond and Melanie Materson in this pitiful little book. (It's okay, because he was using a toy gun to rob and TERRORIZE someone.) There is nothing in this book that enlightens, educates or garners enthusiasm from anyone who has throughout life worked hard to be a good citizen, good spouse, good parent and good person.  It is hard to believe this book was published.  It is not well written and so elementary I was able to read it cover to cover in less than an hour. The book becomes particularly horrible at the end when the Matersons give the impression their romance and connection is so special.  It appears like she was wanting to find someone who could make money and she was the perfect manipulator who got him to take her out of her unhappy life since she was already married with a child when she met and married Materson in prison.  These two were perfect for one another!  Their former lives filled with lies and deceit followed by their present life goal of "let's see how much money we can make from our criminal activities" show they are taking advantage of others one way or the other.  This book is a lesson on how NOT to live your life because not everyone is so taken in by such a selfish existence. The Matersons have used one another for so long it would be surprising if they stay together long enough to write any more books.  Thank goodness for that 
 Be warned!  This book is not about science!  I don't know know who this Henry Miller fellow is but he doesn't know anything about geography.  Imagine my surprise when I purchased this book--expecting to read about the earth's different latitudal circles--and discovered it has nothing to do with the Tropic of Cancer or any other latitudal lines!  In fact, the so-called "author" can't even seem to WRITE in a linear fashion!  I've heard that this "author" has a book about the Tropic of Capricorn out but I'm willing to bet that that one has nothing to do with latitude either!  
 First of all, in this book Monique said that she weighs 220lbs.  I dont think so.  Maybe at one time she did, in high school.  I dont think she was really being real in this book for some reason.  I read the first chapter and maybe 2 pages into the next chapter but couldnt get any futher.  Instead I looked at the black and white pictures she had through out the book.  Being as I dont have anything to read at this monment I might pick the book up and try to read it again in one of my totally bored moments.  Other than that, I really expected more out of this book.  Glad I borrowed it from my sister instead of buying it.  Better luck next time Monique 
 product came broken  now your out of stock,  and i do not have that credit card anymore.so now what. i would like my money back. address 2655 forest blvd. jax, fl.3224 
  I recently saw Brideshead Revisted which I found completely wonderful. It was perhaps one of the most enjoyable and captivating films I've ever immersed myself in.   So, hungry for more Evenlyn Waugh (whose books I read in a college course that was based exclusively on his work), I found "A Handful Of Dust" at my library and figured I'd give it a try. Since the same author wrote it and the film was made by the same film people as Brideshead I was filled with anticipation.   My wife and I watched the first hour or so one night and while it had some good moments, and was certainly beautifully filmed, we were left cold by it. But we figured maybe after that the movie would develop.    So we decided to continue it the following night. Big mistake!   I only wish I could get back the time I wasted on it. While I don't expect "Happy endings" in a film (Brideshead certainly didn't have a "Happy ending") the ending in this story left me in disbelief.    Since I didn't read this particular book by Waugh and didn't know its ending, I was completely unprepared when the credits started rolling that the movie ended as it did. I was amazed by the stupidity of all I had just witnessed.    I thought the story would have been much more interesting to see if Tony would "toughen up" a little, transform and grow from the circumstances of his "captivity" rather than just look like a pathetic fool.    Perhaps the only redeeming aspect of the movie was watching Brenda get what she deserved, still it wasn't enough to justify watching this film.    This film was basically a "series of unfortunate events", with myself feeling most unfortunate of all.   My wife to her credit fell asleep during the last part of the film and used the time more wisely than I did.     Compared with a film like Brideshead Revisited, where the characters really developed throughout the story and took on a tremendous amount of depth, This story, was full of one dimensional characters. Dressing these characters up with beautiful costumes and scenery, well written music and excellent cinematography still didn't save the story from being like a bad "twilight zone" episode.   If you look up my reviews, you will see that I don't go out of my way to give bad reviews, but I was so annoyed by the time I wasted I felt I need to share this. Of course I have just wasted more time in connection with this film by now writing this review, but I felt maybe I could spare someone else the wasted time.       
 After book 4 the series begins to meander around.  Characters are constantly side-tracked into meaningless, boring tasks.  The first 200-300 pages of this book are basically a re-hash of the previous books only excitement (Rand's capture and escape from the "bad witches") seen from different characters perspectives.  This is an example of what writing becomes when the author obviously has no idea of where the story is going, and there obviously is little or no editing.  The author must being paid by the word count and not the content.  The story seems to get written into little boxes, and has to be written back on track again and again.  I no longer have the patience to actually read each page.  I find myself skimming through to find some useful information or a single point of action.  The characters have also stalled out with Rand spending most of his time talking to him-self while the world goes to hell.  His big secret plan to quickly deal with one of the forsaken (started in the previous book) continues to drag on and on and on.....  This series had a good basic story.  Unfortunately you have to wade through crap to try and find it.  I'm beginning to wonder if the series will ever end 
 Despite an interesting title and a beguiling title page, I honestly found nothing exceptional about Robin McKinley's collection of four fairytales. Whether her stories are original or retold, they are rather dull, predictable, and written with long-winded language that makes for sluggish reading. All are centred on the interactions between this world and that of Faerieland - or to be more specific, the interactions between young princesses and the inhabitants of Faerieland. None of these girls are individuals, instead they are cast straight from the princess stereotype and all the stories end on a slightly sickly-sweet note with each dilemma that the girls' face wrapped up in a nice little bow. Faerieland is not seen as a wild and elusive place, but as a pretty sparkling land with none of the depth or hidden meaning that fairytales are meant to have. They are sweet, pretty, *pointless* tales have nothing of the ambiguity or beauty that they could.  In "The Stolen Princess", McKinley tells the tale of one of the last kingdoms that border the realm of Faery, and the anxiety that the residents face concerning the possible stealing of their children. This happened to the Queen's twin sister Ellian, and now the same thing has happened to happen to their only child Linadel. The King and Queen take it upon themselves to rescue their daughter, whilst she herself awakens in the Faerie realm to greet its inhabitants. The pacing of the story is extremely slow, the "love-at-first-sight" scenario is entirely unconvincing, and the descriptions of Faerieland are unimaginative and flat - it sounds like quite a dull place actually.  "The Princess and the Frog" is a retelling of the princess who drops her golden ball and has it returned to her by a frog. Here, the Princess Rana is saved from the malevolent power of an unwelcome suitor's necklace by a talking frog. The ending is utterly preposterous: the frog returns to his human form, and challenges the suitor Aliyander - at this stage Rana runs out of the room, down to the pond, fills a flagon with its water and rushes back to dump the whole lot on Aliyander. Presumably, since no other explanation is given, we are meant to suppose that during this lengthy interlude of running and fetching water, the two foes simply stood looking at each other, since when Rana returns neither one of them has moved. Furthermore, how Rana knows that the pond-water will destroy Aliyander is completely unexplained, and therefore comes across as random and bizzare.  "The Hunting of the Hind" is possibly the only worthwhile read, which tells of Princess Korah, whose kingdom is plauged by the beauty of a golden hind, the very sight of which drives men into madness. When this terrible affliction lands upon her beloved brother, Korah herself goes out in search of the hind to learn its secrets. However, this story too comes to an annoying ending: the hind is under a spell, which can only be broken if a person goes to the wizard who placed the curse and asks him to remove it. But to prevent the wizard from using your inner emotions against you, one must enter his presence completely devoid of any feelings. So Korah leaves her inner emotions in the keeping of the transformed hind (err, how exactly?) and asks the wizard for her freedom. That's it. I was expecting some sort of twist, some sort of test or trick that the young girl must go through, but no - that's it. To top it off, McKinley throws in a brother to the golden hind to act as love-interest for Korah - why must every Princess land herself a hubby in the course of her adventures? Can't she just have the adventure for its own sake?  Lastly is the longest story, "The Twelve Dancing Princesses" which is told from the point of view of a middle-aged soldier, and is made all the better for it - by this stage I was thoroughly tired of McKinley's flat princess-heroines. The soldier takes up the challenge of solving the mystery of the twelve princesses, whose shoes appear each morning entirely worn out, as if they have been dancing all the night long. If you have read this old fairytale, then there is nothing here that will surprise you - McKinley tells the exact same story, except she takes twice as long to do it. There is a slight shadow of intrigue with the appearance of an old woman who aids the soldier, but it's not enough to warrant the energy I used in dragging myself through this story.  As you can see, this is a rather harsh review, and if you happen to be Robin McKinley reading this - no offence! McKinley is a gifted author, and I have enjoyed many of her books, but this collection just left me entirely unsatisfied. I've tried to give legitimate reasons as to why this is simply isn't a worthwhile book, without simply ranting at it, and the truth is that it just felt completely devoid of any real magic or passion. 
 it is not a bad book, but first of all it is not enough for passing the test.Second the book is not really clear and the information sometimes contradicts other informaton on the same book.  For a beginner like me it  wasn't a good book, and hence I dont recommend it 
 I gotta tell you something. I'm really excited about it. Uh, for the first time, today, I woke up, I came to the store, and I - I feel confident to say to you that if you don't take this Michael McDonald DVD - that you've been playing for two years straight - off, I'm going to kill everyone in the store and put a bullet in my brain 
 Well a do not believe this book is rated as 5-star. I do belive the author is extremly good caligraphy painter but this book is intended may be for really small kids at age like 5-10. Everything is explained in souch a simple and shallow way than nobody seriously interested can be satisfied. Sorry .. nice pictures but for sure.. This book does not have anythink but 10 pages in common with caligraphy. So if you are interested in calligraphy and not in creating smal simple gifts to your child friend dont byu it. But once again the book is not bad.. but badly described or may be I just chose it badly, any way I hope this can help otherst to buy or not to buy 
 This is an excellent story well told in script and action. However, it is quite different from the version I saw on a big theater screen. This DVD has speeded up the action  and the English translation dialogue is presented in such rapid changes that it is virtually impossible to read and follow the dialogue. I was very disapointed in this DVD version and would not recommend it to friends 
 The only reason why this cd gets more than 1 star is because anybody that puts krayzie bone on their album is doing something right.  Production is atrocious and don't blame that on a lack of funds cause krayzie put out one the hottest cd's of the year and he got no support from his label.  Coincidentally the best songs on bone brothers were the tracks with krayzie on them.  If this is the best layzie bone has to offer then he better keep his input out of the new bone cd cause this s**t is garbage. 
 I am taking number theory and we are using this book for the course.  This book is so hard to understand. I have spent countless hours just trying to understand and comprehend each theorem and the examples are not helpful.  I  do not recommend this book if you are new to number theory 
 Disordered Minds was a confusing, dull and overly opinionated novel.  I normally read books quickly, even if they're bad, but even I could barely find enough motivation to finish this book in less than a month.  The biggest mistake at the beginning was the inclusion of a huge extract from a book written by one of the main characters, Dr. Jonathon Hughes.  Although this extract gave us all the details about the murder that was to be investigated, it was long-winded and lacked any trace of excitement or `hook' for the reader.  Dr. Jonathon Hughes and Councillor George Gardiner (female) started out as the main characters.  They were definitely an interesting pair and the book picked up a bit at this point although a few of their character details were ridiculous.  I literally shuddered when George said that the reason why she had never married was because she had never found a man as good as her father - it seemed completely stereotypical.  As the middle of the book approached the prose was weighed down by continually going over and over again and again and again the same period when a young girl called Cill was raped.  It was incredibly dull and boring and other characters such as Louise Burton, a.k.a Daisy, a.k.a. Priscilla Fletcher, filled up so much space and time that George and Jonathon were neglected and barely mentioned again apart from a few e-mails and presence in the final chapters.   As Howard, the person they were trying to clear of murder was already dead, there was very little emotional involvement for the reader, as he couldn't be properly vindicated anyway.  As I counted the pages down and the ending loomed near I kept on thinking that surely a twist must occur, surely SOMETHING of interest must happen to have justified the torture of reading this book.  But no, the ending was like a damp squib at a fireworks display, devoid of any real tension or excitement.  The budding relationship between Jonathon and a woman was comical and there was no payback for the reader.  Guilty parties were left unpunished.  Overall Disordered Minds is probably the worst of Walter's books.  I don't mean to be cruel as I absolutely adore The Ice House, The Dark Room and a lot of the others but this book just didn't work for me.  I also hate all the e-mails and witness statements and extracts thrown into the book as they just break up the story and slow the pace and tension down.  JoAnn 
 Three problems with this film:  1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary.  It's very boring.  As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed.    2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging.  The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes.  Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole.  The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting.    3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question.  The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?"  In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake.    Don't waste your life.  ALon 
  This book has a great title and subject but that is all. The author is confused about languages and the subject matter. He shifts between many languages and for the most part of the book, he just complaining about each language. In terms of substance, there is none- really none. The book is very boring, a lot of jargon, definitions and worthless talk. You will not learn any language and you will not learn how to write test benches, heck, you will not want to write test benches - thank god I had already been doing test benches so I know it's not that boring and confusing as the book trying hard to make it. Save your self the money, time and furstration and just go online - there is a lot of info and tutorials about this subject which are more useful I found 
 Bought this 3-pack about 2 months ago (three computers at home) and worked ok- no viruses. Then I did what I thought was a clean install of XP Pro from XP Home on one of the computers, and it carried over a lot of garbage from XP Home I wanted to get rid of, but that's another issue (clean install?}. After installing XP Pro, I was warned I didn't have virus protection and so I tried installing my NAV again. You would think at some point NAV would have enough brains to try and establish that this was a Windows upgrade, and that the NAV was legitimate. Nope- fatal error and computer lock-up, which I was able to survive. No contact opportunity at the Symantec web site.  I simply opted for Microsoft's recommended anti-virus software- Computer Associates. Another twenty. Then I had a heck of a time uninstalling NAV, which wouldn't install and now wouldn't uninstall. What a waste of time and money. Who creates these viruses? We certainly know who benefits from them.  There is really nothing you can do- they are immune unless they hurt someone with media clout. This little note means diddily, but thanks to Amazon anyhow for the opportunity to say something.   
 This photo is very misleading.  The table legs are gold with stripes of black and what is described as slate top is black tile.  The photo showes the tables very light with a light slate but that is not the case with the product we received.  
 Pages and pages of descriptions of trees, fields, sun, clouds, etc.  I have read 100's of books about World War II and was thoroughly disappointed in this book.  I would not recommend to anyone 
 Talk about self-absorbed...I guess the ego and the love of self this man displays are essential to success in business...I thought the man made some good points, but few are helpful to anyone in the real world (or outside  the newspaper business).  Nausea sets in after the second chapter.   Neuharth will die an old, lonely, rich man.  Respected by many, hated by  nearly all.  Luckily, I didn't have to sit through this entire book.  I put  it down quickly 
 I usually like this kind of stuff by ECM. But this is very bland and very very boring. Avoid 
 I am disappointed with this author. There is too much theory to wade through versus application. I wish all of these want-to-be doctor authors could use Dr. Wayne Dyer as the example. If this author would of at least had a closing summary with each chapter, filled with applications and a good review, then I would have given this author a B+, or A, which would of been four or five stars 
 The cover indicated unusual scenes on the golf course.  The other monthly pictures were rather ordinary 
 DRUMMING is Steve Reich's longest work, two full discs of minimalist rhythms performed by an occasionally changing ensemble. This installment in Deutsche Grammophon's "Echo 20/21" series of contemporary music reissues provides a rare complete performance of the work with no cuts, recorded in 1974. In the end, I found "Drumming" to be minimalism at its worst.  During the late 1960s Steve Reich had worked in a studio for electronic music. In 1970 he visited Ghana, and there found confirmation of his suspicion that acoustic instrumentation contained all the possibilities of music by itself. Stylistically "Drumming" is a continuation and final refinement of the phasing technique that Reich had been working with since 1965. This is a process in which "two or three identical instruments playing the same repeating melodic pattern gradually move out of synchronization with each other." Yet, three new techniques are here. The first is that the timbre gradually changes while pitch and rhythm remain constant. The second is that the human voice is used to imitate the exact sound of the surrounding instruments in the ensemble. This has an effect similar to Ligeti's "Clocks and Clouds"). Since the glockenspiels are too high for the human voice to mimic, whistling accompanies the lower registers of the instrument, and a piccolo the higher. The third innovation is the process of substituting beats for rest or vice versa within a repetetive rhythmic cycle. Though there is development of the theme, there is yet only one basic rhythmic pattern for entire two discs of the work.  The ensemble is a showcase of early 1970s avant-garde performers. Cornelius Cardew, who went on to become England's first Maoist composer, plays marimba's here. I think that a similar section of Cardew's work "The Great Learning" (also in "Echo 20/21") is much, much more successful than "Drumming" and encourage all to check it out.  I admit it, I think minimalism is the greatest disaster to befall contemporary music, and has provided more charlatans than any other style. I prefer the zahlenmystik of Gubaidulina, the frenetic business of Lindberg, or even the academic dryness of the lab coat-wearing composer Boulez. Yet, I can appreciate some works of Reich. The other Reich disc in the Echo 21/21, with his "Variations for Winds, Strings, and Keyboards", "Music for Mallet Instruments, Voices, and Organ", and "Six Pianos" is quite enjoyable. "Drumming", on the other hand, is so dull that I felt no compulsion to return to it except the curiosity to know if there was something in there after all. Yet, after many listenings, I find that the work is still without any captivating qualities. The development of the music seems to take longer than in any other minimalist work, and two hours of music have a range so limited that you won't believe you just paid so much for this release.  I really cannot recommend this disc to anyone except those who, like me, are collecting all of the "Echo 20/21" series, or those who want to fill holes in their Reich collection. I was greatly disappointed by "Drumming" 
 I wish I had followed Everett Logan's advice and skipped this cassette. You can tell that the material itself is great, but the narrator is terrible, terrible, terrible. He dumbs down the text. I bought this to give to someone recuperating from surgery, but decided to listen to it myself first. I'm glad I did -- I would have been embarrassed to give this to anyone 
 Do you giggle uncontrollably when poking corpses with a stick? If so, look no further, this book is for you.   I understand a book like this will appeal to a certain demographic. I guess I shouldn't have expected much, and I certainly didn't expect a literary masterpeice, but this was the first book in awhile I just felt like giving up on. I didn't, since it's so short, but I may just as well have. It is not that the book is so "grotesque" or "disturbing" as seen described elsewhere. The author either left out or was incapable of the proper narrative to make the potentially disturbing scenes at all vivid. Unfortunately, that applies to all aspects of this book.   The entire book is in rural vernacular, including ignoring proper punctuation. But the end result is that nothing is described in any detail. It's like reading a poorly worded list of stuff that happened. It's almost as if he wasn't really trying very hard, or as if the story really was told by a simpleminded country person - an omniscient one that can read people's minds. I suppose the idea could have worked, but doesn't. Not a terrible read, just annoying and vague. With so many other good books out there, why waste your time 
 Roll and move, roll and move... and dogs?  What a lame theme.  Ptooey 
 I am an avid fan of the chipmunks. I was there when they first came out. I have the original 45's of The Witch Doctor, The Bird Sitting On My head which are really not the Chipmunks, but I have Alvins Harmonica and The christmas Song and Ragtime Cowboy Joe. I was disappointed when I listened to the first few songs on this album. They aren't the original recordings. I think that should be mentioned. I do have the Greatest HIts of the Chipmunks which are the originals, but they put only 10 or 11 songs on the cd and non of the David Seville songs. I know the original recordings are on Liberty records. I'm not sure if they are still around, but someone must have the original tapes. Lets get the original recordings on cd and not just 10 songs. I would definately get the Grestest hits with the 10 songs. At least they are the originals 
 If you are looking for a textbook you can use to learn statistical methods, this is not the one. The book is most useful for scientists experienced in applying the methods of statistics, who want to sharpen their mathematical apparatus to put their research on a firm foundation. The level of mathematical knowledge required to read the book is not very high but quite demanding as in many cases lots of intermediary calculations are left to the reader, so to properly read the book you have to have a pen and paper to follow the derivation of formulae 
 The high praise heaped on this is by people who have never actually read anything by George Orwell ( OR Francis Schaeffer, or Theodore Dalrymple or even John Mortimer -for the loyal opposition)-Trite, smug and arrogant opinions that warm themselves by the fires of this anti intellectual screed should have the honesty to read Paleo Conservative journals like AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE to see that discontent with neocon foreign policy ( that went on for a FULL 8 years under Clinton as well) is challenged by BOTH those on the left AND the right.It is the lack of intellectual analysis and clarity that has created our current crisis. TRY reading "HOW SHALL WE THEN LIVE?" by SCHAEFFER or DALRYMPLE's "OUR CULTURE ,WHAT's  LEFT of IT" for a more intelligent and cogent analysis 
 This book is a perfect example of a reigning culture ( in this case Western Caucasian ) dressing up it's post-Slavery Era losses and expanding Colonialism as benevolent towards the "child-like" races that only need simple things to be happy in their subordination to the superior white people and their culture.  It stunk of racism to me when I was a child in the 1960s. And stinks of racism now. In a post-Civil Rights era, where we should all know better than excuse this smiling little culturally "unconscience" evil, there is no excuse for this propaganda 
 Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed 
 Have not heard from my youngest son if the book was helpful.  Older son had it and found it useful even though both my sons are strong Christians and confident in their faith and their expression of it. I know it is useful to all students who have not had previous experience with other world views and attacks on their faith. 
 Sorry, but I found this book a total waste of time. I never did like the main character - I found HER boring! I laughed out loud when I read another reviewer say that "this person escaped her life to be a secretary?" - good point! It was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this "new" life without really taking time to search her soul. Instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I couldn't have cared less what happened to her anyway! After reading it (book on tape) I felt I had totally wasted my time. What a disappointment 
 I have read all of cussler's books.  His books start with an historical incident or "hook".He starts with a good prologue in this book and then seems to forget about it until the end of the book...Terrorists and high tech carry the story along, but seemed to bog down the easy reading and continuity of the plot..Go back to the earlier Dirk Pitt novels and enjoy them again..they are much better written and what i have enjoyed in cusslers novels 
 I have been working with this energy for over a year now, and I was REALLY disappointed in this book.  I am not sure the other reviewers and I even READ the same book, to be honest, but the cover's the same....  The book seems to serve as an advertisement for his rather pricey attunement package.  He discusses NOTHING about the origin of Seichim, and can't even decide whether to spell it Seichim or Seichem.  (It varies from chapter to chapter).  So, no origins, no discussion except a disdainful wave about the well accepted symbols of Seichim, and his invocations really only float if part of you is still tied to the Judeo Christian tradition--he invokes God the Father repeatedly.  The end of the book consists of a variety of testimonials and newspaper articles, fluff pieces all.  A VERY disappointing read, unless you're a fan of Benny Hinn style faith healing.  
 Yet another Shakespeare adaptation...but with an epic appeal-to-the-mass-audience cop out.  Romeo must kiss Juliet.  Oh no, interracial sexuality...too risky.  A truly disappointing strategic decision on the part of the producers 
 I read THE BEANS OF EGYPT, MAINE many years ago because it was gathering such brilliant praise.  It is an appalling book.  It is pornographic, disjointed, depressing and very, very weird.  It reads like the drivel that comes out of women's writing classes which is supposed to be so profound but is mearly the meanderings of a mind steeped in Harlequin trash.  It was written most probably on a filthy kitchen table while a pile of dishes fermented in the sink and a baby sitting in a high chair screamed his head off.    This book is not fit for the compost heap 
 A bit disappointing...  I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best.  After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read.  Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books.  Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized "almost", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily.  The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels. Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her.  Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected. Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on.  This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)  
 Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him 
 They're young, hot, and dominating the charts.  But they just don't have what it takes to make a good holiday album.  Destiny's Child attempts to take traditional Christmas carols and make a modern, fan-geared holiday album.  And, sorry to say, but it just doesn't work here.  The album opens with the title track, which I'll admit is a catchy spin off of the original "12 Days of Christmas."  But the lyrics are ridiculous.  Example: "On the eighth day of Christmas my baby gave to me/A pair of Chloe shades and a diamond belly ring."  The next track, "Winter Paradise" is the best of the original tracks on the disc.  It's a more moderate R&B number that talks about Christmas memories.  It's pretty good.  But, "Spread a little love on Christmas" is about on the same level as the title track, but it focuses on all the other holidays going on at Christmas.  The girls DO get a few things right.  The ridiculously-titled "Opera of the Bells" (featured on the Victoria's Secret holiday commercial) is a slowed-down version of "Carol of the Bells," complete with nice harmonies that are actually quite enjoyable.  "This Christmas" is also complete with tight harmonies that give it an enjoyable spin and make it almost unrecognizable.  "A DC Christmas Medley" is a fun assortment of kid's Christmas carols, such as "Santa Claus is Coming to Town," "Frosty," and "Holly, Jolly Christmas."  And the best track on the disc, "Do You Hear what I Hear," is a wonderfully original take on the classic that doesn't wander too far from the original sound of it.  However, the album also takes a turn for the worst in a few places.  "Platinum Bells" is a ludicrous cover of "Siver Bells" that talks about the group's success (platinum albums).  And the cover of "The Little Drummer Boy" is absolutely laughable.  The girls don't even get the story right! ("And then he smiled at me/the little drummer boy smiled at me" -- correction... baby Jesus smiled at you, and YOU ARE the little drummer boy!)  Download the few good tunes off this album from I-tunes and save yourself the money of every single song on here.  Trust me, buying the whole CD is not worth it.  Best Song: "Do You Hear What I Hear" (great original take, true to classic song)  The good: "Winter Paradise" (enjoyable, laid-back original with good harmonies) "This Christmas" (a different take, very original) "A DC Christmas Medley" (it's fun) "Opera of the Bells" (nice harmonies)  The OK: "Silent Night" (pretty good, but Beyonce oversings it) "8 Days of Christmas" (catchy, but with stupid lyrics) "Spread a Little Love on Christmas" (ditto)  The bad: "The Little Drummer Boy" (at least get the story right) "White Christmas" (I don't like their version of this) "Platinum Bells" (too stupid to even laugh at... worst track on the album) "O Holy Night" (I'm very critical of covers of this song because it's my favorite Christmas tune and Michelle's voice just doesn't fit it 
 This book, up to the very end was very good. With out a doubt a three star book maybe three and a half.  The end is what ruins the entire thing. Don't worry I'm not going to spoil anything. I'll just say the ending stinks out loud!  This story is not really horror, its SiFi. A adventure/drama/SiFi. It really should have been about 100 to 200 pages longer. Everything in it was really cool and fun to read but it just seemed rushed. And somethings were not really dove into thoroughly enough. The writting was dead on as always and character development was good.  This book just needed another couple hundred pages to go from a barley average book to a great book 
 I never got the book after ordering. I waited for 3 months since I ordered. Amazon needs to make it clear that they don't have to book in stock if they don't have 
 The  Secret garden  This book was pure disappointment.  This book was definitely not exiting and I can tell you why. First, people who like fun action packed books don't by this book. This book didn't match my type of liking, It was very dull because it had no exiting parts. The only exiting part was when  They found the secret garden. The author  of The Secret Garden explained the characters very well. She caught the 
 I should have known better when I thought this sales book would be any different from the others. No new ideas here. At least you will find that Dan Kennedy's writing style is easy to read and often funny. Ultimately though, I felt like this was one long commercial to sign up for a subscription to Dan's "Inner Circle" club. Skip the book, just go to www.dankennedy.com.   This book is just like one of those sales seminars that pack 15,000 people into an arena under the guise of a "leadership" conference and then just sell you $300 tape collections 
 What's with people always praising this _______ band?  Stones suck.  Unlike their opposite enemies (or basically, their mirrored version) The Beatles, the Rolling Stones did not do _____ for rock.  All they did is create another _________ bad-boy image for fat bikers (don't think I'm insulting motorcycle enthusiasts) who ride around with their morons and call themselves "Hells Angels".  No evolution of any kind, nothing ot look forward to, and _____ lyrics.  NOthing wrong with fun lyrics, but The Rolling Stones's lyrics were typical, mindless, thoughtless, retarded, I could go on.  NOthing wrong with suggestive (Can't use  that other th ree letter word because amazon won't post my review) lyrics, but goot ahave something clever, like the great song "The Bad Touch".  The music itself also sucks.  Boring, simple, repititive, and boring.  Hoe can people like this mess of crappy generic beats and music, I have no clue.  Ballads?  DOn't give a _____ what they have, The Beatles were about 100 times better, and these old ______heads still don't no when to quit.    I must admit, I was a bit of a sheep (_____) and went blindly, but I am cimpletlyt out of that and with every overrated band I hate, I am getting closer to my own opinons forming.  SO if you see me write a hate review for Altar Of Madness despite evbery metalhead  praising it.  So Don't get mad okay?  So in closing, I leave you withb these word: deal with it, you ________.  PS  Reaaaaaaaaly bad example.  Altars of Madness rules.  If you don't have that now, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?!  I was going to review it next, but some reason, Rolling Stones just came up to me.  My next review will be for Altars of Madness 
 If any man had the genius to create the Shroud of Turin, it would had been Leonardo.  Too bad the Shroud's KNOWN history predates the adult Leonardo by more than a century.   Was an "inferior" Shroud replaced by a superior one? Not according to early illustartions of the Shroud, one even depicts the four "poker hole" burns the Shroud currently features. Again, this illustration dramatically predates Leonardo.   Also, readers need to read about "The Oveido Cloth," a relic that could be linked to the Turin Shroud and is confidently dated to at least 800 CE.   The final nail in the coffin for this book is the idea that Leonardo was the inventor of photography, but ultimately sat on this astonishing discovery due to some forged relic he created.

 This one will help you go to sleep for sure. This is my second attempt at Ross MacDonald and I give up. Endings are a given, no surprises here 
 I have been a fan of Mr. Bachs for over 25 years.  I gave his books as gifts to every one I knew, but this book "Out of My Mind" was such a disappointment.  I finished the book in about an hour and wondered where is the rest of the book?  I immediatly noticed the absence of Leslie and the build up to the new women in his life and put it together that he had found a new muse. It was not the divorce that floored me, but the complete absence of a a story!!!  I thought this was just a primer for the real book, so I went to his web page to get info and found that he was selling photos of a pasture and raggedy scarves that had previously flown on his plane for an exorbitant amount of money.  It was then I relized that Leslie must have gotten a tidy settlement and Mr. Bach was perhaps in great need of funds.  I wish him well and thank him for the memories, but will wait for the reviews for his next book.  The title sayed it all "Out of His Mind" 
 Well the title of this book suckered me into purchasing it. This book is a joke and the author should be ashamed of himself. There is nothing easy about this, so the title is very misleading and is an obvious ploy to get you to buy the book. It has the same old problems of your dull, dense, jargon filled college text book. There just isn't enough explanations and the few that are in the book assume to much on the readers behalf and you still end up feeling stumped and disappointed that you didn't learn the skills. I wish I could recommend a different book for you guys out there struggling with ecnm 151 but I just haven't found a good book or an easier way to learn it....or should I say a way to learn it at all. If you want my advice, find the easiest teacher around that gives essay questions on tests or this class will hold you up from getting your degree. Also, study in groups if you can even though this is a luxury given the time constraints of college and insanely fast pace of ecnm classes. One final piece of advice is buy your college text book and start going through it a semester before you take the class because if you get a professor with and attitude and a liking to multiple choice questions your going to have a hard time. There is just too much subject matter here to master in a semester. Your professor mastered it because he/she teaches it, so don't feel bad if you get left behind on this subject. This is a typical college text book and class. They expect you to learn something on your own that you don't know in the first place and believe me you'll get no help from the instructors or this text book. The book seriously lacks explanations through out the text and on some of the more difficult and challenging problems. Oh and author if you read this...get an editor...sheesh. This book is just not a quality product 
 Geez....way back THEN, I absolutely loved Alice. Thirty years later it all looks so immature and ridiculous. His theatrical broadway R & R antics just look wimpy. I still think Alice is probably a pretty cool guy, and I love HEARING his older music (KILLER is still his best album), but this DVD really sucks. It probably deserves 1 star, but I can't bear to give Alice a failing grade, so out of the kindness of my heart, I'll give him 2 stars. Stay away from this DVD.   Oh yeah......they promote this DVD as extra shocking and gross........it's not, compared to today's standards. This whole disc just seems silly 
 In Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity sends out the subliminal message that he and his writing are about truth, justice, and the American way. Just the title represents everything true and good about him and America. For his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs and Hannity's words are the validation of those beliefs.  If this was written by a ghost writer, he should have withheld payment. If it wasn't written by a ghostwriter, Hannity should have one for his next attempt at literary hyperbole.  The first chapter is written in a maudlin, "those-were-the-good-old-days" wistfulness of his immigrant grandfather who he describes as an honest man of integrity, and a believer in the American dream. But before you can say "Erin Go Braugh" he is talking about the courage of George W. Bush for standing up to terrorism. Exactly how G.W. does, he doesn't elaborate. How he goes from grandfather to Dubbya is a bit of magic.  Hannity's next trick is to impugn Clinton and Gore as being soft on terrorism. His source for this is, of all people, Dick Morris who knew the Clintons and now works for the Fox Republican Advocacy Network. He quotes Morris who makes such vague statements as "It seemed they were afraid of talking about terrorism," or "they seemed to be indifferent to terrorism." These "Morris mind-reads" are conjectural, but Hannity uses them, which he does with impunity.  Let's take a closer look at Hannity's unimpeachable source for a moment. It was Dick Morris who quit the Clintons shortly after the second election. It was Morris who had a penchant for streetwalkers, did some jail time, and entered alcohol rehab. You'd think SH could find a better source if he expects freedom to ring!  But, Hannity doesn't skip a beat. He points out how democrats such as Senators Kerry and Daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills. What he neglects to inform his readers are the reasons they did because of riders that were attached to the bills, or the number of republicans who also voted against the same bills, or the many defense bills that Kerry and Daschle did vote for. He never once advises his reader of the defense spending programs that were killed by Dick Cheney when he was Secretary of Defense. Such deception is called propaganda.  Propaganda is something that Hannity has no compunction using here. This he does in continuing to tell a tale that has long since been debunked. Namely, it is the story of President Clinton being offered Osama bin Laden by the Sudanese government. Again, it's what he doesn't say that misdirects the reader. Sudan made the offer in the hope of having the economic sanctions against them for slave-trading, lifted. However, the FBI determined that the Sudanese were playing us because they had neither the ability nor the intent of handing over bin Laden. The Sudanese also made the offer to Saudi Arabia, but the Saudis had revoked bin Laden's citizenship, and refused to take him.  Benjamin Franklin said "Statistics is a liar." Hannity uses charts for the same purpose. He shows how under Reagan, the army bought over 500 tanks. Under Clinton, the army bought none. This leads one to the assumption that Clinton did nothing for the services. He doesn't mention that the army buys tanks, not presidents. He doesn't mention the army had all the tanks they needed for armored warfare against the Soviet Union that never came. He doesn't mention that the army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles.  Be grateful that Hannity cannot rewrite famous works of literature as he attempts to do with history. If he could, instead of seeing a dead Captain Ahab being killed by the whale in "Moby Dick," we might just see a grinning captain standing next to a tethered whale with the caption: "I caught a fish this big!"  There's something very fishy about his facts, his historical parallels which aren't parallel, and what he chooses to tell you, and what he chooses to leave out.  In this book, he tells whale-sized whoppers!        
 The only good thing I can really say about this seat is that it comes in pink. It's hard to find carseats that are not really ugly. Otherwise I cannot take my newborn out without help because this seat does not recline far enough back and her head flops forward. I will be returning to work in a  couple of weeks and will be bringing her with me (I'm a nanny) I don't know how we are going to do it and may have to purchase a new seat already. I would think that if something is deemed an "infant"' carseat it should work correctly and safely from birth not from when the baby can hold their head up 
 I bought this box set thinking it'd be as great as the first two and I was extremely disappointed... I would have preferred that Rhino just continued with the time period and genre that made up Nuggets 2... I've since sold Children of Nuggets on ebay just to get some of my money back... Don't even bother... Stay with Nuggets 2.. 
 WOW!I got this book back in 2003 and I dont recommend this book for begginers its very complex to understand I would rather get  Beginning Tagalog: A Course for Speakers of English     by J. D. Bowen   
 It will interest some that taking the advice of one of the reviewers and putting this book in your luggage when you go to Germany will get you arrested. It is illegal to deny the Holocaust in Germany, where thousands of Germans are still dealing with the guilt of being part of this horror. Showing this book to people will not be concidered "free speach"- Germanny denies itself any right to water-down what happened.   And while you're at it, try check out primary sources for the evidence of the Holocaust - "The Commandant of Auwschwits," a autobiography, is a good place to start 
 What a disappointment!  I should have know there was something up with this album when Red House (her label) put together a recent anthology of their artists and picked a Gilkyson song from 1999 (by contrast, most other selections were from the artist's most recent album, e.g. Lucy Kaplansky's Thin Red Thread).  This album just oozes her venom which might make her feel better when she's done, but doesn't make me feel good listening to it (even several times since I know some of my favorite music can be an 'acquired taste').  I suspect getting to like this album is like learning to enjoy drinking battery acid.    Want meaningful lyrics AND enjoyable listening?  Buy Lucy Kaplansky - any of her albums is light years better than this one 
 Maybe it was me, but I kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and I had to put it down.  It was almost aggravating 
 This is a sad effort and sadder still that these ideas were published. The fact that any publisher believes that readers of social history would be interested in such a twisted analysis of the nature of man/woman and the development of societies is indeed sad. McElvaine is a longtime self promoting boor stuck in a jerkwater academic environment with way too much time for idle pondering. His imagination worked overdrive to produce this piece of fantasy. I guess if any of us had enough time on our hands we too could construct elaborate theories on the 'nature of things' and put enough of a self-loathing feminist slant on it to attract a fringe readership. That's what happened here. Don't waste your time. A disturbing aspect to this is that he's teaching the next generation of leaders 
 Boring, derivative and very mildly amusing. Almodovar did it all before-and much better 20 years ago! I couldn't ever watch it for more than 30 minutes. The only positive comment I have is that the movie shows a more polished and upscale side of Mexico and not the usual slums and sordid lives that seems to be so typical in Mexican movies, at least those imported in the USA. 
 The authors set out on what *appeared* to be an interesting project. How could philosophy be reconstructed in order to be made compatible with the "results" of second-generation cognitive science? Yet Philosophy is not fundamentally an empirical enterprise. Empirical results, while interesting, do not often help to answer philosophical questions. Knowing that we conceptualize time as moving does little to tell us whether the A theory or the B theory of time is true. One of them must be, for they are mutually exclusive alternatives. Is space-time kind of substance, or is it merely a system of relations? Are propositions about the future true *now*? Nothing in this book will give you an inkling. The authors seem confused between a thing and and our conceptualization of it, and the majority of this book just seems like a long ad hominem circumstantial. Even if everyone who ever believed in God was absolutely insane, that would do nothing to settle the *philosophical* issue of whether or not God actually exists. The fact that we conceptualize time spatially tells us nothing about whether or not time is really like space. It might be, and it might not be, the fact that we conceptualize it thus is entirely irrelevant to the issue. The problem lies in their calling these cognitive mechanisms "metaphors", since calling them such presupposes that they cannot be literally true. Since the authors treat them as metaphors, they win by default, and there's simply no argument to be had. For example, they call "time is space" a metaphor. But is it really? The past does not seem to be co-located with the future. They do not interpenetrate each other, and this presupposes that they are indeed "separated" some quasi-spatial sense. It would have been better if the authors examine these "metaphors" as they went along to decide whether they were true or false, instead of postulating a priori that all conceptualizations must be nonliteral. For a whopping 600 pages the content is remarkably sparse. Their shallow analysis of philosophical theories is more likely to inspire laughter than serious reconsideration. Their theory of truth is also very deficient. If whatever is true is true "according to an understanding" how is it that anything ever turns out to be false? Suppose I have two patches of color that are almost exactly the same shade of red, but not quite. Let's call them red #96 and red #97. Suppose further that they look indistinguishable. Then I propose to you that the two patches are the same shade. You look at them and (mis)percieve that they are the same shade. So the proposition is true "according to your understanding". But it is in fact false. Truth fundamentally involves a relation between the asserting mind and the fact asserted, and all the cognitive science in the world cannot change that. I give this wasted exercise two stars 
 This book may seem like a great intro book to those well-versed in Telecommunications. However, the book does a terrible job of explaining terms and jargon. A word, for example, will be used for several pages before being defined. There are very few practical examples and metaphors to illustrate concepts and add interest to the book. There are no photographs here either, only basic illustrations which do not clarify concepts, but instead require explaination.  All of my classmates are disgusted that we are required to use this text. Plans are being set for a post-semester Essential-Guide-to-Telecommunications bonfire 
 Though this is by no means Argento's worst film (his Phantom of the Opera was pure rubbish), this film is also not among his best, and was a disappointment even to Argento (he considered the production of this film cursed--in a way himself buying into the superstition which was part of the plot of the film).  For the Argento fan this film is quite enjoyable in a piecemeal sort of way, but it simply does not work as a whole.  The plot is fraught with enormous gaps in logic.  The scene when characters in the film rely on the memory of birds to identify the killer among opera audience members is utterly absurd, and the end monologue in which the herione announces that she doesn't need other people and has a lot in common with insects is absolutely random, nonsensical, and has absolutely nothing to do with what preceded it in the film.  Such scenes aside, what hurts this film the most is its absolutely corny heavy metal soundtrack, which has a very negative overall impact on the mood and atmosphere established by the film.  This said, the notorious "peephole scene" is one of Argento's most brilliant and effective sequences in any of his films, and this movie is well worth viewing for this scene alone 
 Like other reviewers listed here, I thought this book would focus on the trials and tribulations of cooking recipes that are half-a-century old (if not older)using pithy, witty humor and comparisons of the writer's life and Child's life.  To be fair, there is some of this sprinkled throughout the book, but as an avid cook and Child fan I wish there had been more.  I think there is a market today for food writing; good food writing, like MFK Fisher and Elizabeth David, but I don't think Julie Powell even comes close.  The Julie/Julia Project is a front for this young novelist who see-saws between charming and extremely annoying in her attempts to describe how her life evolves over a one-year period in which she participated (to whatever extent) in some very profound experiences, like working for the government agency dealing with the World Trade Center memorials, a household move in NYC, dealing with a less than stellar marraige, and coping with very needy friends and family.  Julie, get a get a grip on your neurosis and narcissism and just write!  Forget the food, it's just not you.  Stick to your hoo-hum job, your even more narcissistic friends, and your boring marraige and you could be the next Nora Ephron, or at the very least, Erma Bombeck. 
 I borrowed this piece of trash from the library and found it amusing if I did not know some foolish people would take it seriously. Bush and his supporters are so powerful he managed to lose control of Congress. This is the same author who wrote another piece of trash supposrting the liar and perjurer Bill "BJ" Clinton which says all that needs to be said about his creibility 
 If you have read the books this book is a waste of time. It mostly sums up the plot and characters and so forth. If you have not read the books and do not have time to have any fun -- since reading the books is lots of fun -- then this is a quick way to find out what is going on 
 Two things about this book are depressing. First, the author has no patience or self-discipline, and thus cannot possibly learn to play piano well. So why does he go on this "quest" to obtain an expensive piano? The real reason, which goes unsaid but runs as a sad subtext through the book, is that it is easy for the author, who has money, to spend that money on a piano, and the satisfaction of owning the piano serves him as a substitute for the satisfaction that would be gained from learning to play it. The second reason this book is depressing is a quality that this book happens to share with countless "personal journey" memoirs that are coming out these days. It is that the author does not have the discipline, education or interest to write a serious work of non-fiction about pianos, piano manufacture or piano playing, and so turns to the much abused memoir format to squeeze a book out of what are, ultimately, mundane experiences, shallow insights and personal challenges that are ultimately abandoned 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book. I couldn't even believe how biased towards Paul McCartney it was! On many of John Lennon's songs, there is either no more than a paragraph written about it, or it says how Paul was really the "innovator" but "John got the credit for the innovation". It was completely ridiculous. I agree with the reviewer who said this book was another attempt of Paul McCartney's to re-write Beatles history, what with the author trying to portray John as a lesser talent via snide little remarks scattered throughout the book.  Even if this book was completely neutral, I would have disliked it, because it doesn't always cite the inspirations for the songs, or explain the influences for writing them. It mainly explains what the song is about, which is a waste considering all you would have to do is read the lyrics of the song.   To fans who are interested in the real history of The Beatles' songs, hit the Internet. Of course a lot of the information is only speculation, but that's better than what you'll get from this book. 
 I bought this book, believing that the Bible did not include all there is to know about Mary Magdalene. I am open to religious ideas of all teachings. I can consider the possibility that we choose our own paths before we are born into earth, but I found this book to be perverse. What do physical unions between two women have to do with the life of Christ and Mary Magdalene? I've read and loved the Conversations with God books. To compare this heap of trash with Conversations with God is inappropriate. I Remember Union was a huge disappointment to someone on a genuine spiritual journey. I believe the author made the whole story up 
 I'm no genius in RF Engineering but I have come across a lot of good Microwave Engineering books and this is NOT one of them. More to the point, I work entirely with other RF engineers and every person I showed this book to shuddered and began spouting off profanities at it.   Although the book does start out simply enough, the chapters tend to give only a brief overview of the material. The real trouble starts when you try to work the problems at the end of each chapter. With no solid examples or clear explanations of how to proceed, I found myself referring to my other RF textbooks for support.  I have no doubt that if you are borderline Genius, this book will make perfect sense to you. ...But for us less than genius personality types, keep looking, your book is still out there 
 It's well known that 'Showgirls' flopped. I remember director Paul Verhoeven getting an award for having produced something like 'the worst movie of the year'.  It's not hard to point out its failure: the young & attractive lead Elizabeth Berkley cannot act. As Elizabeth is in focus quite a lot, her frequent appearance turns 'Showgirls' into disaster.  In hindsight it's incredible that an experienced director like Paul Verhoeven hired someone like her. I guess the blatant display of nudity in Berkley's role, as well as in this whole movie, made better actresses look elsewhere. The more so, while 'Showgirls' theme and plot are somewhat meagre.  One star for the effort, and another for the nice picturing. Any lavish display of female nudity cannot cover the failure of 'Showgirls' concept 
 I recently borrowed this as an audiobook from the library because I need something to occupy my mind while I scan microfiche at work (boooorrring). I actually haven't finished this book yet, but up until what I listened to tonight, I hadn't made my mind up yet on how I felt about it. I was going to see it though, but now I'm not sure if I will.  I don't even know where to start about what I don't like about this book.  Before starting this book, Ms. Picoult should have spent a little more time researching laws and procedure regarding kidnappings, especially proceedings following such a great span of time. I'll be the first to admit that I don't know much about law, but it seems quite unrealistic that Delia's father Andrew Hopkins (or should I say Charles Matthews?) would be placed in maximum security prison in a matter of a week. I find it hard to believe that on his first day, he would get beaten and practically raped (I can't remember if he was or not). I could be wrong, but if 28 years have passed, wouldn't the statute of limitations passed, and even if they hadn't, wouldn't the mother need to press charges in order for anything to happen? And wouldn't it mean something that they were in a different state?  Now, even though everyone else seemed to love her, Delia was incredibly annoying (and the actress who read her "monologues" in the audio version was equally annoying). Women authors tend to make their female protagonists characters that supposedly have a lot of depth that usually have several men in love with her. I have seen many women in real life who pretend that they have this effect on men, but rarely ever do. It just seems like a fantasy of Picoults, and a very boring one at that. Ah, a love triangle, gee, like THAT's never been done before. One instance that sticks out is when Delia gets upset that Eric (her fiancee and her fathers attorney) doesn't tell her about a court appearing, however, Eric didn't even find out until ten minutes before it was about to happen. But, even the premise for that is questionable: would that really happen? I mean seriously!  I also hated how the book shifted "voices" -- this is not a play, I don't want to read monologues describing the same events from a different perspective. I didn't feel as though it was necessary to divide this book into several characters. I half expected a chapter to be from Sophie (Delia's four year old daughter) perspective. I could really do without the exaggerated and unrealistic jail scenes or the indian lore. I also hated how the entire book seemed to be composed of different memories or thoughts that really made no sense, and then later incorporated into the passage, also not making sense. For example, Eric narrates this dream he had about Sondra, who is some beautiful girl he imagined. She turns into a rabbit and runs into a bush. Later, Ruthann tells a story about a rabbit that shoots the sun with a bow and arrow and causes the earth to burn up. Somehow he connects the two because of the rabbit, when really they have no cohesive connection. Also, between the three childhood friends (Delia, Eric and Fitz) they talk about their memories constantly, as if that is the only thing that binds them together. Real friendships don't compromise of only discussing things that happened to them in the past... but it does in this book, because the author so desperately wants you to know that they are a really close group of friends. To me, it just seems pretentious.  What's also pretentious is the various passages that are supposed to reveal some new idea about life but really make no sense at all. One passage I remember is when Delia is talking to Fitz about memories and she suggests that maybe everyone has the same memories already in the head from when they are born, and maybe they remember things that never happened to them. I might have that a little wrong, because it's a bit confusing. It's confusing because it makes absolutely no sense. It doesn't even feel like it's remotely TRYING to make sense at all! The book is full of little things like this that just feel pseudo-intellectual, like Picoult is forcing her characters to have depth when they really want to be stereotypical.  All of the characters seem a little edgy and totally basket cases. Delia gets incredibly upset for not remembering what her life was when she was FOUR YEARS OLD. For goodness sakes woman, I have maybe 2 or 3 memories from when I was four years old or younger, and most of them don't make sense except for the fact that I know what my parents have told me. By the way she acts, you'd think she was 12 when she was kidnapped.  Also, she seems to recover memories all the time... man, I wish I could do that. It just seems a bit implausible, that's all.  The book is saturated in gooey, sappy imagery, metaphors, anecdotes, memories, subplots, and so on. I am not so quick to totally bash an author, but it's this type of pretentious writernese dribble that I loathe. If I wanted some sappy, melodramatic dimestore paperback I would have read one of those instead. I expected better from the synopsis on the back cover. Overall, and I say overall without even finishing the book (I haven't even gotten to the meth lab part with the father yet, but it sounds pretty ridiculous), that this is definitely one of the most horrible books I've ever read, bar none. Do yourself a favor and skip this one... and definitely don't pick up the audiobook. The voice actors and actresses are incredibly annoying to listen to 
 What were they all thinking? That we could or would swallow this disaster of a movie whole?  Clarkson is almost passable as a totally helpless woman who is faced with her husband's bisexuality -- a no-win situation for any woman. She has reason to be guilty where Sarsgaard's character is concerned -- she with her handy computer -- but frankly who cares!   Sarsgaard is so mystifying, wavering between men and memories and whatever till in an act of vicious vengeance he causes the death of two completely innocent people and one who's sorta guilty.  The actor who plays the husband, whose name momentarily escapes me probably because I've seen him give this same performance in almost everything I've seen him do -- could his name be xerox? -- is so predictable as to be thoroughly forgettable even when he is "acting up a storm"! See his final scene and the alternate ending [which are practically indistinguishable from one another].  These characters are in no way sympathetic, nor is the picture likeable or in any way enjoyable. Prosit.  The one star is for the cinematography, which is acceptable 
 This book lists only a single author.  However, it reads more like a book written by committee and edited by someone who was either lackadaisical or unwilling to supercede the product of the original writers.  At the end of thirty pages I was willing to give it a top score and urge that every American should read it.  Soon, the unevenness of the material and some noticeable flaws wore down my confidence in the writer.  In states with significant Native American populations, most non-Indians have an interest, and at least a rudimentary understanding, concerning their Indian neighbors.  We share American citizenship and much that dictates our way of life.  Unfortunately, the limited knowledge of people living east of the plains states often includes more mistaken information than accurate facts about Indians.  All of us, including those just mentioned, are responsible through our representation in the United States government for numerous financial, legal, and boundary dealings with Indian tribes and individuals.  The first thirty pages of this book is a good overview of the history and past dealings between the United States government and the tribes.  It is general information applicable to all tribes, not just those in Montana.  Every American; whether Indian or non-Indian, native born or immigrant; should know at least this much.  It is American history, maybe more so than such things as Lewis & Clark or America's participation in the World Wars.  The book's copyright is 1996.  Thus it is dated, although I know of nothing that is similar and more recent.  After opening with the general history, this book provides a section for each of Montana's seven reservations, and a section on the Little Shell tribe, often called Montana's landless Indians.  The breakdown in this book is proper.  Most of America's reservations are home to more than one tribe, usually with some sort of combined government (but not necessarily a single treaty).  The tribes are too unique in character, government, history, and locality to be lumped together as some authors have done.  The basis for the closing section of the book is an interview with Bill Yellowtail, a prominent Crow.  Nearly every page of the book contains at least one picture, although text predominates.  About half of the pages contain sidebars, sometimes a page or two long.  Some of the sidebars discuss events or other topics pertinent to the main text, often covering a topic involving more than just one tribe.  Over half of the sidebars are short biographies of individuals, mostly contemporary Native Americans.  The writing of the main text is typically good.  In contrast, the sidebar biographies generally read like the biographies used when introducing speakers at large meetings.  They are choppy and overly praise the individuals.  This is a "feel good" book.  The author introduces the Bill Yellowtail interview by saying that a thread running through the book traces the indomitable, inspiring courage of people who remain forward-looking and hopeful.  This is in contrast to Bill Yellowtail himself who is quoted as urging Indians to take stock of where they are in a brutally honest way.  I agree with Yellowtail.  This book ignores or glosses over problems confronting the tribes.  Reservation government is troubled by friction between tribes, or even clans within a tribe.  There is discord between tribal members living off the reservation and those living on it (typically 40-60 percent live off the reservation).  The population on most reservations includes many non-Indians and they frequently own some of the most productive land.  Laws and the responsibilities for law enforcement on reservations are confusing and often dysfunctional to the point that some jails are literally held together with duct tape.  There isn't any mention in the book of how the U.S. Government has mismanaged trust funds that it holds for the tribes.  The list of issues is long and varied.  If a reader were to take this book as an accurate portrayal of conditions on Montana's reservations in 1996, and then read the news coming from the reservations today, the reader would conclude that conditions are worsening.  That is totally inaccurate.  Native Americans have made great strides in Montana over the past ten years.  Unemployment, alcohol problems, and drug addiction are still high but have improved.  All of the tribes have improved internal leadership, educational opportunities on the reservations, retention of culture, skill in dealing with the non-Indian world, entrepreneurship, and living conditions on the reservations.  One error in the book is so egregious that it must be addressed.  On page 78, the author says, "In 1806, members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition with Captain Clark spent more than a month in Crow Indian country and developed excellent relationships with Crow people."  This is totally false.  Clark and his group never saw a Crow in Montana.  They believed - probably correctly - that the Crow stole all their horses.  Clark wrote a vinegary speech reprimanding the Crow but never found a single Crow to whom he could deliver the speech.  Such errors destroy a reader's confidence in the book and its author.  During what books often call the "Indian wars," the Indians' losses were varied and unbelievably severe.  These same books imply that the "wars" ended with the defeat of Sitting Bull or the massacre at Wounded Knee.  That is not exactly true.  Armed conflict may have ended, but the assault on Indians continued and will continue.  The U.S. Government chips away at Indian land, water, financial entitlements owed the tribes, and treaty rights.  People who do not understand governmental relationships with the tribes, or are deliberately hostile to the tribes, frequently dominate the administrative and legislative branches of our government.  The judicial branch has often been a final resort for Indian people, and there are numerous examples where even that defense failed.  These problems continue to tear at our nation's fabric and all Americans need to be better informed.  Unfortunately, there are few sources that are comprehensive, accurate, and readable.  This book qualifies only in being readable. 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 Having just finished and been mesmerized by "The Emperor's Children", I had high hopes for delving into Claire Messud's earlier works.  This book just fails to engage me on any level, and I tried - truly, gave it about 150 pages worth of trying, but was tempted to leave it in the seat pocket of my flight home last night.  
 At 163 pages, "Wildlife" is more of a novella than anything else and about as dry as the scorched Montana landscape.  The biggest problem is not so much the story, but the way the story is told.  In some cases, the impersonal first-person narrator works, as in "The Great Gatsby", but in others like "Wildlife" or "A Prayer for Owen Meaney", the narrator is such a nonentity that they don't add anything to the story and act only as a buffer that prevents the audience from really getting to know the other, more important characters.  The story, if you don't know, is that when narrator Joe's father loses his job as a golf instructor, he goes into the forest to help fight a wildfire.  While he's gone, Joe's mother has a fling with an older local businessman, Warren Miller, but whether this was already going on before Joe finds out is unclear.  When Joe's father returns from the fire, his mother moves out for a while.  And that's it.  In this case Joe (complete with dull name) has no friends, no ambitions, and few (if any) opinions to share.  He's no one I could ever care about, because his only function seems to be as a recording device to report the activities of his parents to us readers.  The parents, as though aware of this, speak in an unnatural way to always indicate to us what they are feeling or thinking.  It's the problem I've had with all of Ford's books, including the Pulitzer-winning "Independence Day".  Some writers are able to write convincing dialogue and others (like Ford) are not.  It's hard to say much about "Wildlife" because there's so little to it.  There's not a lot of action, drama, or passion and the story itself isn't much that we haven't already seen before.  Again, the story told through Joe the buffer keeps us from really learning anything about the characters and that prevents us from feeling sympathetic towards their plight.  It's hard to feel sorry even for poor Joe, because he's so without distinguishing features to his personality.  I've said this before about similar cases of first-person stories using a bland narrator--which always prompts other people to reach for the "Not Helpful" button--and that is that the story would have been more interesting either in first-person focusing on one of the parents or in third-person and focusing on both, so that we weren't so buffered from everything.  What makes Ford's Bascombe novels "The Sportswriter" and "Independence Day" so much better than his other novels is that we learn just about everything about Frank Bascombe and he is the center of all the action of the story, so that even if he is emotionally detached, it's easier to feel sympathetic towards him as a reader.  This can't be said for this dry little book.  If I hadn't bought this book for about as little as you can realistically pay without stealing it and if it were longer, then I would give it 1-star for wasting my time and money.  But I'll give it a bonus star for not wasting either one.  Now go reach for the Not Helpful button, I command you 
 Lucky Magazine makes me feel Not so Lucky.  It makes me sad that I can not afford all the items they put in their magazine.  One month they tell me round-toed shoes are in and show me 50 pictures of shoes that I would love to own of which 2 I can afford.  Then the following month Lucky tells me round-toed shoes are out and square-toed shoes are in and show me another 50 pictures.  You get the idea?  This magazine is based on trends and you will be broke if you try to keep up and feel bad if you can't afford all the great things it is showing.  I did enjoy Lucky for it's profiles on upcoming designers, some great website links, and the one or two affordable items it does toss in each section.  I also got a few ideas on how to wear clothing in new and different ways.   Most of the time, though, I felt sad and envious after I finished reading it.  These are feelings I'd rather not encounter.  I think I would enjoy it more if it were more informative discussing the quality differences in the items they are showing, maybe testing them out in different situations to help me make the best choice in my purchases.  
 I listened to this book on tape during a long car trip. Instead of offering real vocational advice, as the title seemed to promise, all it presented was a series of biographical sketches and interviews with high-powered people who changed careers. That's inspirational as far as that goes, but it doesn't really provide any useful information that the individual reader could apply to his own life 
 i received the order on sept. 12, 2005, and it was the wrong book, and i still haven't received a refund for their mistake 
 I have read all of the Artimis Fowl Books and loved them until now  I was disapointed with this one, and not found Artmis unusaly irritating, but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good.   Truth be told I was younger when I read the first three, but still I can reread them and enjoy them (as I did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris) so if you want my advice then I suggst you don't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace 
 I own over 100 Brazilian CDs and this is simply the worst of the lot.  I should have known when I saw Bebel Gilberto included.  This is simply a collection of Brazilian musicians who are ashamed to be Brazilian and have to incorporate this electronic garbage from North AMerica into their music.  If you are new to Brazilian music, don't even consider this CD.  Look for a collection of samba, axé, forró or something truly Brazilian 
 The reader should be aware of the fact that the author of this book was in the process of converting from Buddhism to Catholicism when he wrote it. In fact he then went on and wrote a book specifically about THAT - it is titled "The Unexpected Way: On Converting from Buddhism to Catholicism". In my opinion Williams goes out of his way (and at times quite obviously) to promote the view that Buddhism is inherently nihilistic. Rupert Gethin's "The Foundations of Buddhism" is vastly superior, as are the books by Kogen Mizuno: "Essentials of Buddhism" and "Basic Buddhist Concepts" 
 I felt this book was a total waste of time. Jay Adams has a very confusing view of sin and how it is to be dealt with 
 THE FOUNTAINHEAD has been described by one of its many followers - yes, followers, not readers, for the book is essentially unreadable -- as a "passionate defense of individualism [that] presents an exalted view of man's creative potential."   This is a fair description, although it points unintentionally to the book's main flaw:  it is not a novel, but a tract posing as a novel.      Traditional progressive novels tend to be suspicious of the exalted, especially of those who occupy exalted positions based on birth or social class. In the case of Ms. Rand, the exalted are those rare individuals who, like herself, must be allowed to work their will upon the world because they believe themselves exalted.  A circular argument at best, a bad faith argument in truth, this tacit nod to the slow ascent of the common man and woman since the Enlightenment spares Ms. Rand from plumping for monarchy which, even by today's repellent neo-conservatives standards, is universally seen to be repellent.  Because her main character, Howard Roark, architect extraordinaire, is an argument and not recognizably a person, he not surprisingly suffers from a lack of inner-animation.  Sensitive readers will chafe against the underlying and predictable framework that ultimately treats characters as props for Ms. Rand's objectivist philosophy, an anti-progressive stew of prejudices posing as a critique of the welfare state and its "leveling effects."    Here's the problem with her "philosophy:"  for every Howard Roark it raises up as Hero, it writes off millions of people as unworthy of our interest, our sympathy and our compassion. Unkindness is not a philosophy most find acceptable.  With THE FOUNTAINHEAD, Rand attempted to make it so and has managed to fool many.  Because she has, she is therefore lauded by her conservative followers because her apologia absolves them of any responsibility for the fate of their fellow men and women.     Regrettably, this book and her other tendentious work, ATLAS SHRUGGED, have found their way into the backpacks of idealistic college students.  One suspects that many, because their relative youth causes them to see themselves as unique individuals, are seduced by the notion that they, too, are slated for Heroic status.  I have nothing against people having heroes; young people especially should have them.  But Howard Roark is no hero.  He's a stick figure that represents a hero.  I suspect too, that because of their general unreadability, students think the books are "deep."   In retrospect, it seems true that those people whom I knew in college who didn't finish this tract-posing-as-a-novel were people who tended to be relatively reasonable in their social and political views.  Those who did finish it, on the other hand, tended to be immoderate and dogmatic.   Judging by some of the reviews posted here,  this probably remains true today. 
 This book is about a young girl named Mary and her friend. It takes place in Northern France during the time the Nazis were occupying France. The kids don't care about the war until a group of Jewish children running away from the Nazis come to their house with two Nazis soldier hot on their trail. The Jewish children have to hide. Will the Nazis find them? Will Mary and her friends betray them for a bribe?  I give this book one star. I thought that the plot was a little boring and childish. I recommend this book for people who like a easy read.   
 I'm an agronomist and I read this trash-book, here in Brazil. This book , as a tipical pseudo-historic book, puts some real things.Even with some real things, all are used as a cover to frauds and bigoted anti-catholic absurds. A tipical anti-catholic absurd is the claim in this book, that Pius XII was a racist, using the "fact" that this Pope claimed that any "Black" american soldier in Rome, because Pius XII "thought" they were rapers. Nonsense.The real allied troop full of rapers and in Italy, wasn't a black american division.It was really an arabian troop serving the De Gaulle's "Free France".This trash-book "forgets" the fact and invent an anti-catholic fraud. In fact, Pius XII was an eugenics' foe. The opposite was true among famous protestants and jews, at that times. During the civil rights fights in USA, during 1950 decade, Pius XII showed that he was against eugenics/racism again. This trash book draws an absurd and never existed Pius XII. Who gave power to Hitler were eugenicists and communists. Pius XII ever was a Hitler's foe 
 I ordered this book on 6/30/2006, and here we are 1 month later, and still nothing.  I have been notified twice to "update my order".  which basically meant to approve yet another delay for my package.  I love Taschen books, I would love it even more if i could get the darn thing.  
 I want to give an honest review, I bought alot of ad/hd books and I am finally reviewing them. I like to be constructive and have thought of reviewing this book honestly for a while, a bit lazy. So what does the book do well, it takes an interesting concept that controlled fidgeting will help you to focus. It also has a very interesting suggestions like raising a hand before falling asleep will help because your activing your brain enough to focus and fall asleep.   Okay, so what is wrong with it? first of all, this book is initally only 84 pages and with the extra pages and work book, if I can even call it that is 126 pages. I felt like there wasn't alot of effort being put into this book. The idea of fidgeting to focus is obsurd because we naturally do fidget to activate our brains, or we would be in the brainwave of theta, which is sleep walking or very tired. Also there is no guarantee that fidgeting will focus your brain as well as ritalin. Besides that, what else did I not find helpful? The language of every sentence really sounds like it came from a encyclopedia, which makes it dry and very difficult to read. Out of all the books, 84 pages was difficult. It's funny there is the word bordom in the title, it should be called from dianosis to medication, more constructive. Lastly there aren't many suggestions. I found 10 Simple Solutions to Adult ADD to be a much better book. To this day, I still read it for reference, it works so well on all levels, can't praise it enough.   I hope this review didn't sound too negative, I really wanted to find this book useful, I explained exactly why I didn't. I gave other books good reviews because they helped alot, definetly read alot of books on the subject. I think if there was a second edition of this book with more effort on the concept and suggestions, it would be better. It would be a diservice if I didn't tell you the truth and said it was great, still an interesting concept though. 
 Relatively good acting goes nowhere thanks to this lazy piggyback-on-previous-movies-plot (Officer and a Gentleman meets Rocky type deal) chocked with implausible, even ridiculous (and from a military viewpoint-sacrilegious) military scenes. People who haven't seen and/or appreciated the classic An Officer And A Gentleman may find more accessible (albeit numbing) entertainment in this copycat action-spiked fun film. 
 The author is completely wrong when it comes to her statements about breastfeeding.  She also is in favor of a 9-month-old crying it out, and claiming that babies who cry at that age are manipulative (even Dr. Ferber softened his view!)  Again, what disturbed me the most was her inaccurate information about breastfeeding.  Obviously, she chose to wean her babies at a very young age, and wanted to justify her decision.  Instead, I recommend Dr. Sears's, "The Breastfeeding Book", "So That's What They're For" (Janet Tamaro), or "The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding" for accurate, medically-sound information with regards to breastfeeding. 
 I'm a big fan of Hooper's paranormal mysteries and was eagerly awaiting this latest in the series.  However, a FBI agent who is missing her psychic abilities throughout most of the book is not what I was expecting from a Kay Hooper book.  It was hard to get involved with the main characters when so little information was provided, and I found the Satan cult slant boring.   I think the book would have benefited from bringing in one of the agents from her previous books. 
 Honestly, I like Tony Brown. I enjoyed his PBS show. I listen to him on the radio when I can (WLS in Chicago). But, his books are not nearly as good as I know they can be!  This book deals with his "Mama", a woman who took him in when he was a baby and his mother was neglecting him. She was not a blood relative, just a woman who saw a baby starving to death due to neglect. He lived with her until her death when he was 12. This book is an attempt on his part to honor her and the simple wisdom she taught him. The Seven Core Values are:  1. Reality: The Value of Being Yourself. 2. Knowledge: The Value of understanding your purpose 3. Race: The Value of honoring your humanity (In this case, the only race his Mama was worried about was worried about was the human race) 4. History: The value of investing in the future 5. Truth: the value of being true to yourself 6. Patience: the value of "Keeping the faith" 7. Love: the value of living joyfully.  As in his other book, Brown repeats himself a lot. He quotes a passage from Hamlet 3 times (part of the "to thine ownself be true" speech) as part of his multiple descriptions of his high school English teacher. He lifts two pages from his other book concerning a story about a YMCA opening in his hometown. He says the same thing, over and over, repitiously, a lot. He repeats himself. Yes, indeed, he seems to say something and then say it again. Repititive, he is.  Like his last book ('Black Lies, White Lies), this book is in serious need of an editor. He seems to have written the chapters seperately, without regard to what he had previously written. I like the sentiments and ideas expressed, but, man, it was sometimes tiring to read them.  
 Total Control started really-really well for this reader (nice premise/set-up). It had an even more compelling middle (who? who is the bad guy??). The last third of the book imploded as I was pleading for lead character Sydney to get "done in" by the bad guys for being so utterly stupid and annoying. Nothing in this book added up well as it concluded. Baldacci let me down on this one 
 I hated the baby bargains book but this one is WORSE. My pediatrician gave it a hands down and his only comment was "a few authors trying to make a buck." They obviously have no research in this book because they recommend products that are not even age appropriate. These authors have little credibility in my eyes and according to other reviewers, it seems the same. I was never a bargain shopper, really, I mean who is unless you have to be! But, if I was, I don't see this book as a bargain. 
 I don't know who else bought this but I can't imagine what would have happened had we waited to actually get INTO the bed before we turned the thing on...IT FRIED.  Then they tried to charge me the postage and handling when I returned the item.  They did get that quickly straightened out but it was a very frightening purchase.  Always test a product before you risk it on your self or others 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 This book helpfully points out the massive worldwide cabal promoting this ridiculous global warming conspiracy.  Their spies are everywhere!  In fact, those same conspiracists are monitoring every post placed on this very website!  They're watching you right now.  Look out, they're behind you!  Other conspiracies that have been helpfully debunked throughout history:  The Holocaust The Moon Landing Elvis' Death 
 A child wants to tell his father he loves him, and the father turns the exchange into a cruel game of one-upmanship.  The child tries and tries until he collapses, exhausted - and still the father won't accept the heartfelt message and chooses to outdo his tiny child and have the last word. That this book is popular and well received is disturbing to me.  The illustrations are very nice - and I'm hoping that this is the attraction people feel, since the message borders on psychological abuse 
 i've read this entire series, which is quite fun.  At the same time, it's getting very annoying to read about the main character's weight.  The author states that Skye is satisifed with being a size 12 and then bemoans the fact that she will never be a size TWO.  Honestly, who is?  Does so much time have to be wasted on the character's weight..Get over it already or slim her down to an eight or a six.  Jeez 
 This DVD was made after baby one more time exploded onto the scene. it contains no performances or music by britney, and only has a few pictures of her. It's just a bunch of interviews with people from her hometown in louisianna...all of which have hair straight out of the 80s and don't work well in front of cameras. It's been recorded on a home video camcorder obviously.  my advice is to skip this...save your money, it's a snoozefest. Even if you area  huge britney fan, you'll end up regretting buying this 
 sorry, can't finish this garbage movie. is this girl retarded  or what? watching her father been killed in cold blood and got no feeling or emotion at all. how and why the garbage collecting, turned cow feeder young guy, would then have turned into a cold blood stone cold killer? there's no enough logic and explanation why he would have turned into a psychopath. the girl didn't look a bit retarded but acted and behaved like one is also a not quite well developed character. the whole movie just looked too deadbeat and senseless. what? life was too boring then what? started becoming natural born killer? give me a break. bone chilling? you can always say that again, but won't make me care a bit more. 
 I am a Rick Braun fan owning every CD he has released. However, Rick has lost his creative edge on this effort. After the first composition, it is down hill from there. I have noticed other smooth jazz artist releasing new stuff that simply does not not merit buying. Steve Cole's latest CD comes to mind, as well as Bob James and a few others. In any event, skip this one. Its not worth purchasing 
 New York criminalist, Lincoln Rhyme, is in North Carolina to undergo surgery which he hopes will improve his quadriplegia.  A sheriff from the small town of Tanners Corner asks for his help.  A teenaged boy has been murdered and two young women kidnapped by a youth known as Insect Boy.  Rhyme, along with his protagee' and soul mate Amelia Sachs and his aide Thom, agree to help.  This is the first book by Deaver I've read and, while I am hoping it was just a bad choice,  I'm not certain I'll read another.  I really struggled to get through it.  I had no history of the principal characters and none was given.  In fact, all the characters were one dimensional, there were two many of them and stereotypes ran rampant.  I like a good twist or two in a story but this became laughable.  And let's not even talk about the ending!   I did feel Deaver did a very good job conveying the problems and frustrations of a quadriplegic, but that was the only redeeming feature.  As for the plot, the title says it all.  This rated zero on the believability scale.   
 You need a plan, and its going to take work. No Kidding? You need an image. REALLY? When you submit items, you may get turned down - NO?!?! This book is ok if it's your first on the subject, but if you have ANY kind of marketing knowledge, skip it. I came across one idea that I thought, HEY Never thought of that. I had to force myself to finish it. Not enough examples of a press release's or other items (but you have tp PLAN, AND SPELL CHECK - WOW!). He has a chapter on the internet, that again is for the beginner, and almost a beginners guide to html. How about where to promote on the Internet? One positive is the author availability. He publishes all sorts of ways to contact him. It was easily read (although I was frustrated by the end as it wasn't giving me what I wanted). He explains how you can take a press release, reword it, and re-release it. I got the feeling he did that with each chapter. (Sorry Jeff) 
 This is a truly pathetic excuse for a movie.  The dialogue is rambling and often incoherent (Keaton looks high much of the time and moves a hand constantly toward her nose), the story is confusing and unconvincing (and has to be explained, twice), the camera work is labored, and the artisie illusions and music are oh, so obviously "in".  Worst of all, the film isn't funny.  It should be no surprise that Woody Allen soon moved into a much darker genre of film making to occupy his later years 
 I bought this hoping for wise advice on financial matters. I instead found this book to be 200 pages of talk without substance. The points it makes (dont retire, quit work, die broke) are remade over and over in different ways without much of any intelligent argument as to why or how. I felt the book was not worth a read at all and was just a bunch of fluff to make up 200 pages. It was poorly organized as well with different subjects per each chapter. For example chap. 8 is "Accountants" through chapter 46 is a one page chapter on "Savings Accounts." I couldnt believe how many words were used that never said anything. Blah 
 In this book Dr. Laura talks about the virtue of staying at home and raising her children.  That's what I have choosen to do but NOT WHAT SHE DOES.  I have a hard time getting past the fact that she has a dialy raido show, she writes books and had a television show all while is the "Mother of her Kids."  She not living the life she preaches.    I can not see the value in her advice when she makes radically different choices.  When you are reading her books THAT IS HER WORK, when you are listening to her radio show SHE IS AT WORK.  She has had affairs with married men and she is one of the working mothers she seems to hate.  Take a good look at her life before you listen to her rantings 
 The Covert-One series, written by a variety of authors, unfortunately does not live up to Ludlum's standards. Since Paris Option was my first of the series, it was bearable, but all other Covert-Ones are very similar to each other. If you've read any one book from this series, I would suggest you stay away from the rest.  The suspense is decent, but the climax is very predictable and it all works out somehow in the end, without a well-thought out approach to the finale. Covert-Ones start with a variety of events occuring simultaneously, events that in the beginning don't really seem to have a bearing on the other. In the middle of the book somewhere, it all comes together leading to a high-testoterone (but somewhat unbelievable) climax 
 What is it nowadays that criminals like Kevin Weeks gets to write and publish books for the masses. Whitey Bulger is still loose and people like Kevin Weeks probably know where he is. I don't have much sympathy for Weeks. He hates Howie Carr probably because he reports the truth as he knows it to be. Anyway I read Howie's book which I recommend. I thought New Jersey had too many criminals mingled in politics. I was wrong because Massachusetts had the Bulger Brothers. Regardless of how different they are, both brothers abused their power for themselves. One, Whitey, far more than his brother in politics who also got away with crimes but I don't think murder. Anyway I am giving it two stars 
 I ordered a Motorola RAZR V3 Mauve Phone (Unlocked)a month ago. I was hoping to get the color that I saw on the web page...and that's where the problem lies.   The image shown is completely misleading.The phone that I received, was mauve but a different one from the picture shown on the Amazon web site. The mauve phone that I got was a grayish dull mauve and not the pretty pinkish mauve as advertised. Also,the phone had 2 different color tones. At night/in the lighting at night, the top part of the phone(the part that flips open) and its corresponding part at the back of the phone looks completely gray.  Needless to say, I spoke to customer service and sent the phone back for an exchange.I didn't have to pay the shipping charges.   The 2nd phone that came had the same color problem again, so for the 2nd time I returned it and got my money refunded.  I gave 1 star due to the customer service provided, but again they could not help me. Some one said it could be an item with a defect....but for me the whole experience was  disappointing.  If you are ready to spend so much on this phone its because of the brand, and the 'color' which you will never get because Amazon has put the wrong image on the web page...very misleading and wrong to all the customers.  Incidentally, this color as seen is offered by Verizon and they call it 'pink', but Amazon calls it 'mauve',though the phone and the image shown do not match.  So stay away from ordering this pretty mauve phone...all you will get is loads of disappointment with your time being wasted.   
 I am disappointed with the new format.  I have been buying this calendar for myself and for family and friends for the past 10 years.  I do not like that the photos carry over to 2 pages.  I do not like the all black dates and I miss the quotes/passages from books that related to the particular photo.  
 I have loved this series from the beginning - great characters, fun stories, thrills and romance.  Very light, quick reads that are great entertainment.  This story was awful.  There were two mysteries.  One was wrapped up so quickly it was very unrewarding, and the other was so convoluted I didn't even get it.    A comment was made that one person, when convicted, wouldn't be around to hurt anyone any more. But this person wasn't even the perp for the big mystery.  And the epilogue? WHO was that person?  And how did they figure it out?  Too many holes for an otherwise easy read.    Finally, the characterization was off.  The normal comraderie between the girls was missing.  I felt no love from the original three for Yuki, in spite of her storyline.  If there's a sixth story, I hope it brings back some of the magic from the earlier books.  I'm giving this book two stars only because these characters are like old friends.  If I had just picked up the series with this book, it would be a one.  Sorry James 
 Hmmm. I'm struggling to give Agatha Christie such a low rating. She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into. Not quick reads, but very methodical with lots of character development. I don't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters, but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending. Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the "who, where and why" were finally revealed in the end. I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I didn't know who the killer was, but actually because I already knew who and how. I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious. Very disappointing. Christie books I would recommend instead - ABC murders, And Then There Were None and Murder of Roger Ackroyd 
 I took a numerical analysis course last semester at my university and had a horrible time understanding this book. As many reviewers have already stated, there aren't very many examples and the explanations aren't very clear. I had to refer to a number of other books from the school library to actually figure anything out. Don't waste your money on this book, there are much better books on the subject out there 
 Watered down folk-psych circa 1968. If you think Country Joe and The Fish is too hard rock then this is for you. Too too flower power and not very imaginative, in fact it's rather boring. Perhaps it should be retitled Exile On Yawn Street 
 I was very disappointed - there was no humor in any of these stories.  There was not one character that was balanced or that I could even like.  Italians are affectionate and they laugh at family gatherings - there was no warmth or laughter in this book 
 I found this at a thrift store.  Figured "hey, a cheap Sonic Youth CD, I haven't heard them for awhile."  Should have left it in the store.  Uninspired minimalism, and sounds as if they are totally bored with the experience or are all suffering from Alzheimer's-- with the exception of "streamXsonic subway" which isn't bad, but not worth the price of the CD (even at the thrift store).  They've seen far better days, this is downright pathetic.. 
 Very beginner. Slow as can be. If you are just starting Yoga let this be your instructional DVD.  NOT FOR THE EXPERIENCED. 
 Most Americans know a little about China, especially the history during Culture Revolution, and most distinguished Chinese writers can't write in English, therefore, Anchee has chance to get well known in the US. However, her novel is quite superficial both in English and Chinese. If it is translated into Chinese, I am afraid very few people would buy it since the story is boring. Additionally, she claimed to be trained in a studio organized by Jiang, Ching, Madam Mao. I doubt the truthfulness about something claimed by her in the story. There is no official materials to support it. I bet American will understand China better if many excellent Chinese novels can be translated in English. One example is Chinese resturants in the US. Generally, they can not be claimed as original Chinese foods, they are just adapted to the taste of some Americans, which explains why most Chinese do not like most of so called Chinese resturants in the US. If Americans have been to China, they will definitely like foods there better.   I met Anchee a couple of times previously when she sold her books.  
 I ordered the 50's Style Rockabilly Polka Dot Dress in a 1X. I am a full sized woman with a small waist and a well endowed chest. The cup size for the 1X looked to be about a C cup at the most. I sent back the 1X for the 3X in which the cupsize looked to be a D, the dress has no support what so ever in the chest area so a bra is a must for heavier chested women. The waist and back area was way too large in the 3x. I was not only displeased with the fit but the quality of the material is poor as well. The dots are screenprinted on so after a few washes they will begin to crack and fade, it does say handwash (but even still some of the dots are already lighter than others). I'm giving the dress two stars because the style of the dress is really nice and if you can get it to fit the right way its not a bad price at all, but it's definitely not a dress that your going to have around for a long time. 
 Literary arrogance at its height, this book takes simple concepts and makes them obtuse.  If that is an accomplishment, then I'll grant the praise.  I would prefer some of her contemporaries like Waugh or Cathers who's prose gives me far more pleasure without the hubris - and in the end teaches me far more about life, and writing.  Don't be intimidated by pedants who call this great, trust your own judgement and the emperor's clothes reveal themselves for what they aren't. 
 Everyone here seems to have bought the line that the author and publisher are selling them -- that this is somehow a "definitive" translation, simply because the author isn't a Westerner.  This is a blatant appeal to authority fallacy if I ever heard one.  The fact is that being an Asian and a Taoist master doesn't make one a good translator, and this good is proof of that.  Frankly, it is riddled with errors.  For an example of a review by someone who REALLY knows what they are talking about, see: http://biroco.com/yijing/karcherhuang.htm about halfway down the page, after the review of Karcher's book. In the meantime, please save yourself the money and invest in a truly good translation, such as Richard Lynn's 
 I bought this book so I'd have something interesting to read during my son's tonsillectomy last fall.  I was hoping to enjoy the torrid love scenes in it!  I got half-way through the book, and it bothered me so much (my own issues getting in the way?), I put the book away.  I felt Anna was emotionally neglecting her daughter, Molly, while involved in her lustful dysfunctional relationship with Leo.  I didn't like any of the main characters, including Molly---all too unrealistic.  But I picked up the book yesterday and finished it.  The book was too flat!  Though I don't think she was a BAD mom, she certainly exercised poor judgment (and for what?  Like Leo was a good catch?)!  I wasted my time (I don't read books very often) on this story.  Yet I did read the whole book, hoping it would get better, so I'm giving it 2 stars.  I didn't think I'd get any more of Sue Miller's books, but other reviewers said she has better novels 
 I purchased this movie with Amazon unbox.  I downloaded it to my high def series 3 Tivo.  It was very disappointing.  The picture was little on my high def screen.  It is a letter boxed standard def program which looks very very small on a high def screen.  I even tried changing the aspect on my television.  No improvement.  Come on Amazon, you know what type of Tivo I have, Tivo knows what type of television I have, let's produce something that is at least watchable on every setup 
 I really believe in trend following - I use this strategy.  I bought this book with an expectation of gaining more knowledge about the strategy.  After I read it, I can honestly say that it gave me nothing but an overview of the greatest trend followers.  Actually, I should have known that before hand, since the title of the book is "How Great Traders Make....", it does not say "How YOU can make...".   So, if you are looking for "trend following" know-how, you will not get it from this book.  You can learn a lot more by reading the "trending" tutorial on the clearstation 
 When I was first forced to read this book, in high school, I detested it, and the following years I spit in the direction of anyone who even remotely praised it.  But, lately I've been going back to some of the books I read in high school that I loathed, Huck Finn being one that I absolutely love now, Twain was a genius, Fitzgerald, however, was not.  I can appreciate the attempt at trying to depict the "higher class" as emotionless demons bent on self satisfaction, totally void of any comprehension of other people, I can appreciate the story of Gatsby, a man determined, to such a degree as to build a massive house, filled with empty trinkets, and hold parties in the hopes that she'll attend, to win back what he thought was the love of his life, but what I can't appreciated, at all, is the book in general.  Fitzgerald was a good writer, that's it, just good, not great, and certainly not spectacular.  And for all the "deep" and "hidden" messages of the book that people seem so meaninglessly deperate to find, seriously, this is nothing more than a literary soap opera attempting to come off as artistic.  I've got Tender is the Night and This Side of Paradise, still checked out from the library, but I do believe one exposure to Fitzgerald's mediocre style is enough.  Hemingway dominates beyond belief over F. Scott 
 What a beautiful, godly message of self-respect for young women.  The analogy of two identical apples entrusted to two sisters to be kept for the rightful owner should have encouraged girls to resist sex before marriage and guard themselves for the wonderful man that God has for them. Instead it smacks of nighttime drama - sort of like an episode of "Dynasty."    One apple was overexposed, handled and caused to rot due to a careless bite taken by a man for whom the apple was not intended and did not belong.  The other apple was wisely hidden and protected so it stayed fresh and lovely.  With a stunning lack of sensitivity, the sister who is blonde, beautiful, fun-loving, and cheerful, must also be the self-centered, vain fool who lacks good judgement and integrity.  It follows that her apple rots.  As totally expected, the plain sister must have dark hair, be serious by nature and favored by her parents. She has the misfortune of being overlooked and undervalued.  But, stereotypically, her shining character makes up for her lack of beauty and vivaciousness.  Although she lacks charm and confidence, her care of the apple wins her the marriage proposal of the handsome, manly and discerning prince.    She is chosen - not for being attractive in her own right, but for her sterling character.  The blonde, pretty, but unworthy sister flees the scene in tears.  Although full of remorse for her mistakes, she is out of luck.  She is only mentioned again for having the ability to overcome her jealousy of her sister's good fortune.  Why is it necessary to equate beauty with badness and uglyness with goodness?  Why did they have to be sisters?  The contrast only makes God look unjust to both and unforgiving of the "loser."  Why will my daugters never read this book?  You guessed it.  Their looks and personality mirror the sisters in this fairytale.  Does that make one foolish and other wise?  Of course not.  I am tired of the same old yarn about the pretty blonde only being valued for her looks, (because it stands to reason that she stinks inside).  I am even more sickened by the assumption that the "plain" girl is destined to live in the shadow of her sister, fighting despair and hopelessness because her only value is her good heart.    Isn't beauty in the eye of the beholder, anyway?  Why confirm the Hollywood perversion of beauty?  It is detrimental to the self-esteem of both girls.  I will find another way to honor the attributes of my daughters without comparing them to one another.  This story, in effect, illustrates that they are both, for differing reasons, inferior to each other.  In addition they are each, at least partly, undesirable to their future husbands. (Neither one is the whole package - pursued for having godly character and God-given sex appeal.)  I love all of Lisa's novels.  Needless to say, I am furious that I wasted my hopes and money on this one.  This storybook won't even be donated to the library.  I have already slipped into the trash.  Suzann 
 I just did not like this book at all.  Children should not be having parliments.  What foolishness this all was.  All it does is prove the point that children cannot and should not rule.  They are imature!  The ending was bad too.  I hate books with bad endings.  Don't waste your money like I did. 
 The fact that Euge wanted to use equipment no later than 1976 did facinate me. However, even with the great collaborators he worked with, this was not Euge's best work,  I'd expected way more effort than his previous albums. The only song I liked in the album was "Chillaxin." Other than that nothing else caught my attention.  My biggest problem are the interludes in the CD's. While some CD's include just one interlude, there is no reason valuable space on a CD shouldn't be wasted on 3 INTERLUDES!!! To me, that's laziness not creativity. Because of these interludes, this CD is one of the shortest playing CD's I have.  Other than that, this CD is good on a slow relaxing day if you don't mind changing CDs in a short time. I'd rather keep listening to his Livin Large CD 
 The tao te ching is a great book, I'm not giving that a one star review, I'm giving mitchell's interpretation of it one star.  As many other reviews have stated, he doesn't speak chinese, so this translation is comprised of his reading other peoples' translations and what he thinks it means.  He then tries to modernize it and make it accessible to 21st century americans.  I like the old world feel of this book, you don't need to change swords to nuclear warheads, I know what a sword is.  At least though, this change makes sense, some chapters Mitchell changes so much, that the entire chapter loses its meaning.  A couple chapters made no sense, so I went to the back of the book where he tells what parts he changed, and then I was able to understand exactly what Lao Tzu intended to say.  Don't buy this book.  
 Not very well written. Its is simplistic & somewhat condescending. Later chapters tend to repeat basic concepts covered earlier without expanding upon the issues. There are more knowlegable authors out there that are refreshing and can effectively advance the your knowledge 
 While I generally respect Blomberg's works in other areas, I think he has done a disservice here. It is true that the conversations between Christians (and I include Catholics here, not just evangelicals) and Mormons have often been bellicose. However there is a reason for this. The long-standing mormon doctrines that God declared all other churches to be an abomination in his sight, frequent insulting comments from mormon general authorities towards Christians and the 60,000 missionaries trying to convert Christians into mormonism with a sugar coated version of their faith have inevitably led to Christian resentment. Like many conversations I have had with mormons and especially missionaries, Robinson dances around controversial doctrine making it hard to pin him down. Sure mormons talk about Jesus and God, but they mean something completely different than is meant by Christians. One reviewer praised the book for ignoring "minor" issues like polygamy. When Joseph Smith and subsequent "prophets" declared and affirmed polygamy as a "new and everlasting covenant", even implying for many years that Jesus was a polygamist, it is hardly a minor or inconsequential point of doctrine. I think Blomberg misses the point here that needs to be emphasized to Christians: we do not attack mormons as individuals, but we do not accept the teachings of the mormon church and leadership as compatible in any way with Christianity. Our conversations with mormons absolutely must be done in love, but without concession. By Blomberg going out of his way to avoid what are referred to as "tired, old arguments" against mormonism, he misses the mark. The reason that these arguments have been around for so long is because they are so damaging to the mormon claim as the exclusive church, and have never been refuted. There are plenty of books out there that compare Christian and mormon doctrine and do so without kid gloves for fear of offending anyone. I would rather offend a mormon and maybe save their soul than be afraid to witness to them until it is too late. I am a former mormon and have been through the temple, and I can say unreservedly that what goes on inside the mormon temple is absolutely contrary to what is taught in the Bible. We as Christians owe it to mormons, who are generally wonderful people, to testify to them with both love and truth 
 To anyone wanting to buy this book for the "true Crime" value , please don't. Other then the shortly described misery Bobby Kent put people through the rest is made up scenerios and untrue accounts. I have had the chance to get to know several people involved and all agree on one thing , the book is full of it.  If this was a fiction book it would be great . If you have already read this book and would like to know the truth or ask questions there is a Yahoo group that may help .  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/freemartypuccio 
 This movie was only good because of two reasons.  RAMMSTEIN, and Queens of the Stone Age.  Other than that, completel out of control P.O.S. that keeps its viewers contemplating whether they have died and this movie is their eternal punishment in hell 
 "And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"   When I read the New Testament, I find a God of love and compassion. In these books I find a message of hate and fear. Why are so many eager to condemn those around them who don't believe exactly as you do? The history of early Christianity isn't one of a uniform understanding of Christ's message. If even those right after Christ couldn't get is right, why, on earth, do you believe that you understand the exact message of God? I would suggest we all work on bringing ourselves closer to God's love and spend less time imagining the punishment of those who don't conform to our idea of how God wants us to live 
 I recently purchased - and returned - a Bowflex Ultimate 2 and I wanted to convey just how disappointed I was with the whole experience.    My equipment arrived on January 10th.  As I opened the boxes, I realized that not only were there no assembly instructions, there weren't any user instructions on how to modify the machine to do the different exercises.  I contacted Bowflex immediately and was told that a mistake had been made, but that I could download the assembly instructions from the website.  I was also told that a user manual would be sent to me.    One week later on January 17th, I contacted Bowflex because I had not yet received the user guide and because during the assembly of the Ultimate 2, I noticed that one of the plastic balls that prevents the cables from coming off the cables was broken.  The representative I spoke to again pledged to send me a user manual and a replacement ball so that I could use the machine.  I asked if they could be overnighted because the machine was unusable to me with the broken ball (which allowed the cable to pull through) and without a users guide.  The representative said she would expedite the order but that she could not overnight it.  She told me she  could not tell me for certain when it would arrive.     By the end of day, Friday, January 19th, it was apparent to me that the items would not be arriving before the weekend and that it would be more than three weeks from the day I ordered the machine before I would be able to use it.  It was very frustrating to me that Bowflex would not overnight these items so I could fix and use the machine as soon as possible.  These items did not arrive until 7 days later, making it a full month from the date of my order before the equipment would have been functional.    For these reasons, I elected to return the equipment to Bowflex.  I was expecting far better customer service for something that cost over $2,000.  Making matters far worse was the cost for me to return the items to Bowflex.  Using UPS as Bowflex recommended and knowing that the cost for Bowflex to ship the items to me was about $200, I expected it to cost about $200 to ship the items back to Washington.  However, because all returns must go to Virginia, the cost to ship the items via UPS Ground in the original boxes to Virginia was $489 - more than double the original amount.  I'm assuming that two reasons explain the cost difference 1) Bowflex must get some sort of discount from UPS for all of its shipping traffic 2) naturally, it is more expensive to ship from California to Virginia than it is to ship to Washington.  Regardless of the reason, my Bowflex ownership experience was only made worse by the fact that I had to spend 25% of the original purchase price to ship the item back.    This whole experience has made it very difficult for me to ever have anything good to say to anyone about my experience owning Nautilus equipment.  
 I really liked this unit (and its transmitter unit twin), but only for as long as it actually worked. It works well sending signal from my TiVo in the living room to my office, where I have a TV monitor and the audio running through a decent sound system on the computer. I really like the capability to use the TiVo remote from the office. However, after a few months, both of the transmitter units I've bought have died. (I've bought full pairs both times.) I can still get audio, but the video feed is gone. I'm to the point now where I'm looking for alternatives. 
      Murderous mice threaten to devour hospital patients unless they're taken to their leader Mickey...just kidding.        At a mental health institution, the rats from a forgotten experiment (how anyone can forget an experiment I'll never understand, talk about a swiss cheese memory) have begun to mutate (of course) and eat the patients (guess the kitchen was out of head cheese) just as an undercover reporter checks in to do an inside story on the clinic (timing is everything, the proverbial hickory clock must not have struck one yet and the mouse is still running up it).       Okay, I have to be honest, this movie was lame. The special effects were horrible. The mother rat looked like some cheesy Halloween house decoration you'd leave out on your porch to wipe your feet on. The rat spawns had such fake glowing red eyes you'd think they'd be blind (but then again they all had their tails and there were way more than three of them). There was even a "Willard" type character who had a telepathic bond with the rodents (all he must have heard was "Brains! Brains! Must have fresh brains!" because the rats decapitated their victims). Although if you're actually into B- horror flicks you may love this movie and think it's the Mouse King of the genre.       Ron Perlman plays the head of the institution and the head of the forgotten experiment. It's a bad movie but he at least is, as always, good. Want to know more? Remember the remarks I made earlier about head cheese and decapitations?       Definitely spend no more than a cost of a rental and definitely have a drink 
 Living in southwest Florida in the area of much of the locale of this story I was constantly reminded of the tangle of the mangrove forests which are typical of the coastal waters of this part of the world and the Ten Thousand Islands in particular. Virtually impenetrable. So was the confusing mass of cracker family detail piled on the reader. One has to force one's way through it and the result is a pretty thin story at the end. However the author's tidbits of history about the area and the spoilation of the Everglades is of interest for those having some knowledge of and curiosity about the subjects. I also felt that this New York born writer carries a lot of his Yankee baggage with him which causes him to unload the usual northern liberal unsympathetic, vulgar, racist stereotyping of southern life of the past on the readers. Way overdone 
 I love Don Henley but I love him with the Eagles.  In this show, once you get past the Nehru jacket, the orange hair & the dark glasses, he barely tries to give anything resembling a performance.  He stands there looking smug, virtually saying to his audience 'don't I write great lyrics' and 'I'm a great singer, aren't I'.  The appallingly offhand version of The Heart Of The Matter has been swamped by the Eagles' Hell Freezes Over version.  What he does to his most famous song, Hotel California, beggars belief.  Those legendary gravel-lined vocal chords are no more than adequate.  And perhaps this is being petty, but the anonymous band are given two separate credits for a 'Musical Director' and a 'Band Leader', both of which, when Henley is in his rightful place with the Eagles, are handled by someone called G. Frey, without a credit 
 There is no information in this book that I haven't read or been told before.  This morning I tried to make one of the recipes from the book, the "Wholesome Whole-Grain Muffins" and they were a disaster.  Behan instructs that this recipe makes 18 muffins, but I used 18 muffin cups and the batter overflowed and made my kitchen smell terrible (not great when a pregnant woman is feeling nauseous anyway) and they are burnt on the edges and not quite cooked in the middles.  This is coming from someone who loves to bake and has a little experience behind making muffins.  The batter was very watery and the small taste I took (what I could stand after smelling burnt batter all morning) was very, very sweet.  I would not recommend purchasing this book 
 Thankfully I watched this movie having recorded it on my DVR so I could fast forward through most of the scenes with Uma Thurman and John Travolta.  Their scenes and dialogue were so horrible that fast forward was the only way to get through the movie.  Besides, this is not the kind of movie that you really need their dialogue to understand or enjoy it.    As usual, Uma's acting is simply dreadful. I tend to avoid any movie with her in it because I know it will be bad.  How she became a "star" in Hollywood is beyond me.  She is not attractive nor can she act.  She could have been replaced by a nobody and it wouldn't have changed the movie one bit.  I think when they need an actress who doesn't mind playing drivel roles, they call her. John Travolta is not much better.  His version of "cool" just doesn't do it for me. His diction is becoming more slurred as the years go by that I hate to hear him speak.  And someone please tell Uma and John that nobdody wants to see them dance so please just stop finding reasons to do so.    The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of The Rock and Vince Vaughn.  Their roles were priceless and had me laughing all throughout the movie.  I never grew tired of Vaughn pimping and The Rock primping.  While I fast forwarded through Uma and Travolta's scenes, I tended to rewind during Rock's and Vaughn's scenes; they were so funny I had to see them again.  Cedric the Entertainer was also pretty good.    
 but I wouldn't know because when I got my copy (not ordered from Amazon) it was this super thick disk that was bigger than all my other CD's and won't fit in my CD player.  As a result I'm afraid to try it in my car becuase I don't want it to get stuck.  But since ABC is using one of the tracks to promote it's new fall lineup, I get the idea....  Maybe I'll just download them from ITunes.. 
 I was looking for a book on creating textures in photoshop or painting in photoshop, but this is not the book.  It had a few tutorials on creating textures, but I had to read through half of the book first.  If you are serious about buying this book, you should take the time and check it out in your local book store first 
 It's conceivable that some scholarly professor living in some dimly-lit library on some hermetically-sealed university campus will be able to decipher this jargon-filled tome. For the rest of us, this book is a virtually unreadable barrage of dry, dismal, academic slang without even a single moment of levity. It's two-hundred-plus pages of "crucial cultural intertexts" and "structural homology" and "strucural displacement" -- and those three phrases came from ONE SENTENCE on page four!   How is it possible to write a book about Bollywood that is so utterly devoid of color and joy? The author has accomplished exactly that. It could be that this book might contain a few tangible ideas or meaningful illuminations, but they're buried so deeply under the weight of such pompous verbage that they'll never see the light of day. Bollywood has never been so tediously presented 
 I would have been fascinated to read a comparison of how Protestants are treated in, say, Italy, Spain, Portugal or France.  What's that you say?  There Are no Protestants in those countries!?  They were tortured, murdered, driven out of their homelands or forced to convert to Catholicism many centuries ago!?  Wow.  I guess in comparison, American Catholics should consider themselves extremely lucky to be allowed to immigrate to a land founded by Protestants, to practice their faith, to get rich if they work hard, and to share every freedom that people of other denominations enjoy.  And, being so grateful for this freedom, I have no doubt that they all work hard to ensure that Protestants in Catholic countries have the same rights and privileges, right?  uh... Right 
 I've just finished this book and found it rather annoying. Though I have enjoyed the Pitt series along the way, it seems that Anne Perry plays fast and loose with historical facts and, in this story, contrives an entirely unlikely key to resolve the plot.  Although no date for the story is given it appears to be set about 1880. The fact that Pitt and other characters have telephones at home, when the telephone was first invented in 1876 and not in general use until much later, is one problem. Another is a reference to someone's having seen another character's photograph in the newspaper, when photos were not used in newspapers until considerably later.  The chief bad guy in this story, police inspector Wetron, supposedly knows that one of his underlings is trying to catch him in illegal acts. So Perry has him leave a clue in his office that will lead the underling to his home, where apparently Wetron is planning on catching him. But the clue he leaves in his office is the real thing - a link to his criminal activity. How dumb can that be? And then he allows the underling to spirit him off on a wild goose chase in the middle of the night while his house is searched. The ridiculousness of this ruined the story for me. 
 I've had this camera for 2 years and I am glad that it broke so I can (in good conscious) buy a new camera. It is so slow that it is impossible to catch anything but the back of my kids heads as they run away because they got tired of saying "Cheese". I always thought the battery life was sufficient, and that the quality of the images was fine, but I hardly got good shots because of how slow the camera was. I'd put the shoot button and it would take about 2 seconds before the camera would click. I actually sent it back to the manufacturer thinking there was something wrong with it, but they said it was functioning normally. It was probably the most disappointing $200 purchase I've made 
 Normally I don't review content on DVDs just execution ....this product suffers on both counts.  The true story of BABE RUTH is a legendary one...and this movie pays little attention to much of it.  With all the amazing athletic feats to deal with this movie mostly takes the personal route and gets pretty redundant with it...how many belches do we need to hear or meals do we need to see consumed at record pace? Goodman could have played Ruth...but he'd have needed to drop some weight...lots of it.  Ruth was a great athlete and while his weight fluctuated he was never the blob that Goodman is.  I remember seeing this movie when it first played in theatres and until I actually saw real footage of Ruth and learned the true story years later did I realize what a travesty this "movie of the week" type project is.... BEST THING ABOUT THIS DVD?  the two bonus featurettes starring the real BABE RUTH as bonus features...they alone are worth the ten bucks 
 What were they thinking when they made the contrast so hard to read? What's wrong with black and white? The designs are attractive, but you'll go blind trying to reproduce them. Did I mention that the charts are hard  to read 
 The Mayor of Casterbridge is an enormous dissapointment. My wife and I have enjoyed more than a dozen BBC dramas on DVD which have distinguished themselves through brilliant acting and quality cinema production. This film is painfully slow and seemingly amateur in execution. We wouldn't recommend it 
 Was disappointed in the ideas.  Seemed to be more of an extension of the author's collections, than ideas for the reader. Scanned the book it and put it on the shelf, won't be one that I use as a constant reference 
 Although this product is very nice, I feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect. To me the words "charge all at once" means that I can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall. However, this is not the case. This item is simply a method for organizing you devices. Although it is a nice idea, it is certainly not worth the $34.99 I paid, and if it wasn't a gift, and Christmas wasn't 3.5 days away, I WOULD return it. I feel that by using the words, "charge all at once" they are purposely misleading the customer. 
 "Yoga for Beginners" sounded easy enough since I know nothing about Yoga. After trying this DVD for 2 weeks I felt like I was locked in a bad Twister game. There are so many instructions flying at you all at once it is almost impossible to keep up. And I knew that I must be doing the poses incorrectly because it HURT! I was ready to toss-in my Yoga towel until I discovered a Rodney Yee beginning Yoga DVD. MUCH better...somehow he manages to get you into the poses with ease and comfort. Skip the Barbara Benagh and look for Rodney 
 Good effort, but get an editor, and write a good sentence! A few good ideas, a resource or two, but not worth the money and the two month shipping time 
 This book leaves you so thoroughly unprepared for the exam, I wonder if the editors (or the people who wrote the glowing review above) actually know what a network is.  Don't waste your money 
 THIS KANSAS COLLECTION DIDN'T DO SO GOOD...THE ONLY GOOD SONG IS CARRY ON WAYWARD SON. THAT IS THE ONLY SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD ON THE RADIO 
 I am newly preg too. I went out and got this book without reading any reviews. I sum it up this way: a pompous composition of contradiction and condescension. I can't stand the tone and the constant jabs seemingly mocking you and having a GREAT OLD TIME enjoying those pains you will be feeling! IE ..And all those trips to the bathroom to hug the toilet. Ha ha ha...  Last night, I'm reading her stupid book and I get some good advice on what to do with your friends who are smokers. I would just not be near them while they smoke. Period. She says to threaten them with the law that protects non-smokers. Good idea...If that doesn't work, Ask them ALL TO QUIT because YOU are pregnant. And if that doesn't work try being nice. I don't know many smokers but I don't know even one who would smoke in a house or one who would smoke outside and blow the smoke in my face. Another comment that really got me..Take a good look at your slim waistline because won't see it for a LONG TIME! (Implied: OR Ever!) I take pride in keeping myself fit. I am a little freaked about the weight issue. I find that comment insensitive to a point of being twisted. What about the first-timers who are also former eating disorders --like me. Even the woman on the cover of this book looks like a Stepford Wife. 
    "bell hooks" may very well be insane.    Rather than take responsibility for her own ludicrous actions and assertions, Ms. Hooks continually reasserts her position that none-none!-of her cruel and immoral actions are her own fault because of the ridiculous misfortune she had by being born dark-skinned and female.    I am an academic, I admit, but I live in the real world, and I know that the vast majority of Americans are simply attempting to carve out lives as best they can.  We work, we sleep, we pray.  Sometimes we fall in love.  Sometimes we read, and I deeply regret the thought of Ms. Hook's racist immorality falling into the hands of already volatile citizens.  When our country can no longer rise up and denounce racism (which Ms. Hooks claims to do, though of course, only perpetuates the problem), when we do not thoroughly reject those who advocate violence, theft, and irresponsibility, we are indeed in a sad and terrifying state.    The great civil rights leaders of the 1960's insisted upon non-violence.  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. built an entire system of social reform upon the concept of peaceful resistance.  I know, grade-school regurgitation, but Ms. Hooks could stand to review (or, dare I say, read for the first time) her Dr. King.  "Letter from a Birmingham Jail" carefully outlines the fact that civil rights are in adherence with Divine Law, and that there is a just, holy, and perfect law which all humans must obey.    How can the racist rants-the "Killing Rage-of Bell Hooks possibly compare to the heights of Dr. King's moral reasoning?  The Civil Rights movement was a humble, firm request that the United States government obey natural law.  What does Ms. Hooks have to offer?  Anger.  Hatred.  Accusation.    In "Letter from a Birmingham Jail," Dr. King is careful to say that should the Civil Rights movement forget its Christian roots (he warns, particularly, about conversion to Islam), it will fail in its endeavors.  What have civil rights been since our society has, in great chunks, disregarded God?  Violence, the death of innocents, lies, double standards, the welfare state, fatherless children, the rise of drugs and gangs.    Ms. Hooks, before you and your kind crept into our university systems (which, of course, we touchingly remember are the bourgeois institutions busily funding your lush lifestyle), black children were raised by two parents, in relatively safe neighborhoods.  They were taught to love God and country, and to do, as Dr. King and all moral leaders have done, what is right.    You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Ms. Hooks, for presenting your message as helpful.  You are not helping.  You are a woman obsessed; you are resentful; you have no peace.  How could anyone possibly want to live as you so claim?  Do you desire discord?  Are you so hardened to your own heart?  Are you so evil?    I urge all who are concerned with issues of race to consider Dr. King (immoral though he was, in many sad ways), to urge one another to live righteously, and leave the garbage Ms. Hooks spreads on the curb, where the bourgeois-funded trash collectors will, if we're lucky, cart it away 
 The play "Into the Woods" not only contains sinister elements, but has an overall dark message to convey.  It preaches moral relativism as blatantly as any catechism teaches religious doctrine.  It teaches is that lying, stealing, cheating, and even murder can be justified as long as it is not against one's perspective on life.  Also, that life is grim and experiencing things forbidden will help you.  This religious doctrine of corruption is conveyed through the story and through specific lyrics of the songs 
 I liked this book up until the ending.  I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book.  Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me 
 Roger Waters would scoff at this rip off. Some Pink Floydish tunes mixed with sound effects and sonic interludes. Pompous, arrogant...I'm sorry but this group is not the modern answer to the great prog hope. I'm sorry but I can't relate to this nor Spock's Beard's horse hockey. For the retro lover like Spaniel Pegrossa 
 I was so excited to buy this video for my 3 year old daughter, as she is absolutely fascinated with My Little Pony toys, books, etc. What I never expected were the comments she made while watching it. I certainly never expected that I needed to review it for content before putting it in. When your daughter keeps saying, "They are being really rude and mean, mommy... we should take it out..." I knew I had a problem. The video actually scared her, as the movie is a FAR stretch from the innocence and sweetness of the other My Little Pony products. I absolutely would NOT recommend this for other children. If you do buy it... I recommend you watching it BEFORE letting your child watch it. 
 Saw the previews of the first movie, but I wasn't expecting too much from that. I tried to finish both the first and the second, but that didn't work out too well...I felt these films didn't deserved to be watched all the way to the end. I don't know how some of y'all were able to sit through this poor excuse of a movie, and that includes the first. All I really have to say is you if you like this movie or maybe a better version of it...Y'all should really consider watching Cops and those insane police chases shown on TV. After all this is just another episode of Cops with guest actors in it 
 I bought this book excited by the premise and found it to be a sad disappointment. Populated with gross stereotypes, misrepresentative of the Faith, and full of poorly-constructed two-dimensional characters made colorful by circumstance rather than spirit, Rinaldi takes a beautiful piece of Church Lore and turns it into a relativistic anti-Catholic romp. Propaganda at its worst.  Irredeemably convoluted if not downright hateful 
 Personally I have found the format of the book difficult to read and follow, which gets in the way of the knowledge contained therein. I am a fan of headings, bullets, tables, boxes etc (high visual impact) - and this book does NOT use this in a clear fashion. Apart from this, the actual information presented (the little I have read) is thorough.  Maybe a second edition will tidy up 
 I really thought the author had a terrific idea in writing a send up of our modern world plotted around a sensational killing. All the elements were there, the media, hollywood, gays, etc. However, he missed the opportunity to paint the characters and the plot in broad satirical brush strokes. Often you could almost take these characters seriously. The dialogue, which is probably typical for Dunne, is too clever by half. This book certainly did not make me want to read any more of his writings 
 This book was disappointing.  For starters, if you're cooking healthy recipes you should not be using instant rice, or canned cream-of-whatever soup. And just because you're cooking for children doesn't mean you have to add sugar to vegetables!   There are a few good recipes but borrow from your library first.  I think the early Mollie Katzen cookbooks (Enchanted Broccoli Forest, Moosewood Cookbook) have much healthier recipes 
 This is a must have! Verbs can be so tricky when learning Italian...don't give up - this book will help you gain confidence in using the correct tense and you will be able to create sentences that will make actual sense!?  E scusatemi se e' poco! In bocca al lupo a tutti 
 Unfortunately this little book tells almost nothing about how to actually do covered call writing. It is filled with hype about what covered call writing can do for you, but that's where it stops. The whole subject deserves far better treatment, as it can be a very lucrative technique. I returned this book and got my money back 
 Disappointing.  In my opinion the title is misleading, it's more compendium of objects you might use on your altar than a "complete guide." Illustrations are only line drawings, paper is very cheap.  I  don't get the sense of quality that the subject deserves.  Some helpful  information 
 Although what a book says is perhaps the most pressing sphere in which to evaluate it, the way those words are presented can sometimes, sadly, eclipse the content.  This is one of those unfortunate books, cast asunder before it was even fully born. The crime: body text in sans-serif! And not only that, but on glossy pages. I could almost handle the typeface, but it does, truly, give me a headache. Add in the somewhat patchy editing and it makes for a lot of frustration.  A fascinating book with fascinating content. If only I could read it for more than a few minutes at a time. If, like me, you are one of those who refuses to purchase books printed in horrible, difficult-to-read fonts: this is one of them 
 they did not specify that it was the study guide instead of the actual book I needed. 
  Bought this book thinking that it might be the key to opening my brain to math. I'm bad at math. So I've been reading every subject surrounding it hoping to grasp an understanding of what it is and maybe have that "eureka" moment. But it didn't happen.  So maybe I'm judging this book harshly just because it failed to intrigue me enough to understand math.  Have you ever noticed how people who can add and subtract in their heads tend to laugh at us people who can't? And then they tsk-tsk us when we can't even get it right on paper. Yet, along with me, they can make gross mistakes in English and those who know better say nothing at all, lest they hurt their feelings.... 
 Don't expect too much from this book.  This book is merely an advertising tool for ebay powersellers.  You get to know their history, their ebay IDs, their products and a sales pitch on how great they are.  Sure they gave some tips here and there but don't expect any secrets.  One seller said that the most important part of a sucessful ebay business is the source of product, but he doesn't reveal his source.  Another seller said that drop shipping is an important part of his business.  You don't have to touch the product and you can save storage space.  Great, did he tell us which company he uses to drop ship?  Nope.  Again, don't expect any secrets.  If you like motivational books and want to read success stories, then I suppose this book might do; but if you're looking for secrets to start or enhance your current business, get another book.  Try Marsha Collier and her various ebay books 
 The book is just a series of short notes with very simplistic ideas such as buying notebooks/3 ring binders/ folders.  All of the info is readily available on-line and for free 
 There is something about the fact that this vampire uses or needs an airplane to fly around from place to place that just takes away from any horror this film could really create.  Stephen King's "The Night Flier" has a very poor plot and an even poorer cast of characters.  Shame on you Stephen King!!  Moreover, there is not one character in the entire movie that you can relate to or even sympathize with in the slightest.    The movie centers around a selfish and crass newspaper reporter who is trying to track a serial killer who flies his plane from airport to airport in search of victims.  It becomes increasingly apparent that this serial killer is not human.  Now, the only reason this film does not get a 1 star rating is that the vampire is rather horrifying looking and the ending is slightly creepy, but everything else about this movie fails to evoke any interest in me whatsoever.  If you really want to see a good vampire flick, you should watch the original "Salem's Lot", directed by Tobe Hooper (not that "new" garbage that came out recently on TNT), which is one of, if not the scariest movie of all-time.    To be quite frank, I'm reluctant to give "The Night Flier" even 2 stars, but, as I said above, there are a couple of creepy/scary elements to it.  If you see it on TV, you should check it out for yourself, but it's not worth a penny to me.  
 JOSEPH SMITH WAS A FALSE PROPHET! Read the Bible about false prophets, then read what informed critics have to say about Joseph Smith. Remember, DON'T DRINK THE KOOL-AID!! 
 ugh.  as a confessed bibliophile, i honestly try to give every single book its due.  but this one was impossible...poetic, but impossible.  barrett attempts to weave these stories about antiquated botanists into one connective tissue but it is too far a stretch.  unless you eat, breath and sleep xylem and phloem, don't waste time trying to pad through this book 
 If you are interested in Kabbala, it is best approached within the framework of a lifestyle observant of Jewish Law.  As one reads Gershon Scholem's books the thoughtful reader will quickly realize that he does not believe what he is writing. His point of view is intellectual only and he did not in his lifetime practice.   Anyone can take some of the principles of Kabbala and use them to get some pretty cool results. The unfortunate thing is that the earlier comment that you can get the same feelings from reading a dungeons and dragons book was absolutely true. The author of the Zoar, and the real kabalistic texts assume that the only people reading them would be Torah Observant Jews.   For the Kabbala to be explored, even slightly, requires the same strict adherence to Torah that the early masters had. Anything less is folly. Yes you can have nice feelings that are real, but you can get those practicing tai chi, you can meditate deeply, but anyone can do that counting sheep.  These people who say that this books and all others by Gershon Scholem are a waste of time are correct, but don't allow that to convince you that Kabbala is not of value. He did not know that he approached it in the wrong way, but you don't have to.   If you are interested in learning Kabbala do not purchase this book. 
 True, I do have to read part 7 still, but part 5 & 6 were very poorly done in my opinion.  First of all, it's obvious that the reason for the failure in 5 and 6 is that the gunslingers have lost their edge.  They have become parodies of themselves.  In another review I saw the phrase, "overly mannered," which I feel hits home.  The redundant vernacular: palaver, deal in lead, come commala this, come commala that, come commala with a wiffle ball bat, so... King is fastidious with his overdone jargon that sounds sickenly hackneyed.  Since when did gunslingers become such wimps?  Since part 5 & 6.  That's when.  The repetitive symbolism gets overdone until anything having to do with a 19, dinn, or Ka, is just charred nuggets.  The symbolism has lost its zest by being referred to annoyingly countless times.  As another reader stated, I can't wait to finish the Tower Series, so I can feel some closure on a story that went sour.             
 I will admit, I flipped through a few of the pages in this book, read some funny bits and decided to buy it. I might as well have thrown $15 down the toilet.  After suggestions that people with potential eating disorders should be "banned from the universe" and telling a pregnant women, with hormones raging, that if she isn't having sex with her husband that he'll probably have an affair, I gave up on this piece of trash. There are other comments too, that could make any woman not "Playboy" material (She is a Playmate, ladies) feel like garbage. If you want to make yourself feel horrible, go ahead and buy this book. If you'd like to celebrate your pregnancy and feel good about yourself, there are plenty of other books out there for you. STAY AWAY. 
 Bruner raises some interesting points and rather validly questions some of the developments in psychology and the search for meaning.  However, his points, which are delightfully simple, are somehow lost in a sea of convoluted sentences and meaningless words.  His examples makes this book only accessable to the trained gurus.  It could have been a great commentary, but I ended up so frustrated sometimes that I would lose track of what Bruner was arguing 
 No other reviews helped me with what I got when I bought this book. First off, unless your into guy on guy, woman on woman, or multiple partners, this book might have no interest to you. The positions in this book are redundant, and most of which everyone has tried. The harder ones require great flexibility, which can be fun but there's not enough of them. They have half the book as the above mentioned, guy on guy, girl on girl and more then two people. This is definately not for just couples. if you're a couple and looking for a book to get hints from, this is not the book. Also, if you don't have horizontal and veritical poles in your house, that takes away another quarter of the book. So basically you're only left with the same positions everyone has tried numorous times 
 Once again "Dr." Churchill (he of course could never actually submit himself to the discipline and hard work necessary for a doctorate} steps forward to spew forth his usual set of lies and distortions calculated to promote his extreme and anti-American ideological agenda.  Hitler was right, and Churchill knows it:  the bigger the lie and the more often it is repeated the more believable it becomes.  In Churchill's case the lie that is implicit in his every word and contention is that America is a place of injustice, racism, and greed.  Of course, what Churchill cannot provide is a reasoned account of the human past that makes meaningful comparisons between America and other mass societies.  So if Churchill were actually a scholar and met his responsibility to place American history in context by referencing other cultures what other societies would he decide have a better humanitarian record? India, surely not, they still have unofficial untouchables there, and a hundred and fifty years ago they burnt widows alive.  Russia, not worth discussing.  China, yeah right.  The British empire?  Native American societies?  Well, almost without exception they were warrior cultures in which men killed and stole from other Indians (or as in the case of mesoamerica ripped the bleeding hearts out of living adults and children) and that practiced slavery - not the idea most of us have of a just society.  No, Ward, America is not a place of injustice, racism, and greed, though of course as in all societies those elements are present.  America is the place where popular sovereignty was  implemented for the first time in the human experience, the place that in its two hundred years of history has steadily become more democratic, inclusive, and just, the nation that created the United Nations and that torpedoed Europe's hopes of reestablishing colonialism after World War II, the country that was instrumental in defeating fascism, the country that faced down the geniunely evil Soviet Communism (60 million unnecessary dead between 1917 and 1953)while spreading Western enlightenment ideas like natural rights and women's empowerment throughout the world, and the place that two to three billion people elsewhere would dearly love to live (gallup poll in Mexico showed that 46% of its people, for instance, wish to live in the United States).  Were Indians displaced?  yes.  Did Indians die off from new and unfamiliar diseases brought to the Western Hemisphere by Europeans and Africans?  Yes, but it is a fact that all of human history is a litany of stronger cultures overwhelming and frequently destroying weaker cultures.  Indeed, human social and technological advancement has been held by some to be a function of that process.  But of course, Ward Churchill is not interested in discussing this truth, just making points.  The other side of this book is the fact that it is written by a man who has been judged by an objective panel of his peers as a thief and a liar, and who have in detail demolished the factual basis for virtually all of Churchill's assertions (go see online the report of the faculty review committee of the University of Colorado).  Inevitably there will be those so dissatisfied with their own life and reality that they will find in Churchill's work reenforcement for the righteousness of their own alienation.  For the rest of us, Churchill's chief contribution is that he illustrates just how farcical  and bizarre academia can be. It would be risible if it were not so tragic. Garbage, true, but interesting garbage that sadly speaks to our time and place 
 Read Quigleys Tragedy and Hope.  Its a much more important book(especially the 2nd 600 pgs) and a better read too.  After reading it you will feel as though you were just pulled out of the Matrix.. 
 I was thoroughly disappointed with the product.  They were not all that tender and certainly not worth what I paid for the produc 
 I loved the art and rhymes in the book. However, there was a lot of fill in the blank spots for your baby's first few years. I prefer to jot my own thoughts instead of someone elses. There is not much place for pictures or extra writing either. I wish it had at least one pocket for storage of keepsakes. I will look for something that meets my needs 
 I TRASHED THE ISSUE WHEN I SAW THE SHOT OF TRASHY PARIS HILTON.  THERE IS ENOUGH NUDITY ALREADY IN YOUR PUBLICATION AND SEEING THAT SAD PIECE OF WORK (HER) ON THE COVER JUST TURNED ME OFF COMPLETELY.  SORRY YOU THOUGHT HER 'COVER WORTHY'.  PROBABLY MISSED SOME FINE ARTICLES.  SINCERELY: DEANE EVERETT  
 I was expecting a historical account of SIGINT, but what I found was on the verge of mysterious black helicopters and alien autopsies. I am not even half way through and I don't think I can finish it. Not only is some of the basic technical open source information inaccurate (try google), but a lot of his statements are suppositions or suspicions of an imaginative kid.   If you are looking for a book that has accurate historical information about signal reconnaissance, try: The Price of Vigilance : Attacks on American Surveillance Flights by Larry Tart and Robert Keefe ( I initially thought Chatter was by the same author, big mistake! 
 The content of this book should have been the informercial for this book.  Although I understand the need for self promotion.....this book goes way overboard. Everything has been said before and at the end you feel like this book was geared for these two mens' fans and not people who are really looking for ways and means to get out of the rat race.  Hey Robert! We know about your other books and your game.  Donald, we know about your show.  Its great that those things made you rich but we want books with less fluff and less talk about your crap!!!! Honestly, if you havent been living under a rock for the last ten years, this book is a BIG waste of time and money!! 
 I notice several other reviews mentioning faulty/defective consoles arriving. Well, I received my first Schwinn 438 about a month ago. I put it all together, and realized they did not ship an AC adapter with the machine. I contacted Amazon, they told me to either send the machine back for another or contact the manufacturer. I contacted the manufacturer on Saturday, they were closed. I contacted them the following Monday and they told me the item was on back order, but, I could buy a compatible adapter from Radio Shack. I did. I came home excited to use my elliptical, unfortunately, the console did nothing but beep at me..very frustrating. I contacted the manufacturer again, they advised me that the console was on backorder and would not be delivered for at least 2 months. They recommended I send the unit back to Amazon for a replacement. I did so. I spent the better part of a night taking the thing apart and repackaging it...quite a job trying to squeeze it back in the box. About 3 weeks later, I received my second elliptical. Same faulty console problem, after spending another couple of hours putting the thing together. Contacted Amazon and demanded a full refund and return. They did pick the unit up, and did not make me take it all apart this time, but, I am still awaiting a full refund. I have since purchased a Vision Fitness elliptical from a real fitness shop in my area. I am extremely happy with the unit, although it was a few hundred bucks more. This was one horrific experience with Amazon. I wouldn't recommend buying this product, seems like they are shipping out defective units 
 The monographs lack any sort of scientific references.  A true reference manual should list references so the reader can verify the conclusions made 
 This book may be good for some, however it is misleading in the description. I was led to beleive that this book was in fact comic book coversations to help explain simple situations to my child with Autism. Instead, you have to write your own comic strips to do the explaining. Not worth the book in my opinion if it is still up to me to do all the work, I already do that without this book 
 After reading the book I can understand the disparity in the customer  reviews. "State of Mind" was a disappointment to me as I found  Mr. Katzenbach's "Hart's War" & "Shadowman" among  the best books I have ever read. Parts of "State of Mind" just  flew by and I became quite engrossed...then periods of dull nonaction.  Perhaps it was just too long. Were it not for my faith in Mr. Katzenbach's  writing there were many times I would have quit this one. Kept figuring it  would pick up in the next chapter. Ending is a pretty good payoff, but  takes too long to get there and it's a plodding journey. Set in a Blade  Runner world the overall plot made sense and the characters were well  drawn. Mr. Katzenbach has entertained me before and will again 
 This is probably the worst textbook that I have used in the past two years.  The book makes a lot of basic concepts seem very difficult and a lacks the proper examples to even explain what the problems at the end of the chapter are asking.  The wording is very boring and tends to put the reader to sleep- making the poor explanation of concepts even worse.  The authors jump around and often fail to define terms or use them before they are explained.  The index has proved to be worthless in many of these instances.  There are a lot of problems that I do not believe could be solved by a new edition 
 In "Rebel-in-Chief", author Fred Barnes does his best to prop up a failed administration.  Barnes is an inside-the-beltway Conservative commentator for -who else? "Fair and Balanced" Fox News, so it seems legitimate to question his impartiality.  Barnes praises Bush for taking bold action against terrorism, and providing unwavering leadership, even in times of decreasing public popularity.   But 2/3 of Americans know that the interests that Bush is protecting so fiercely are the interests of his base: "the haves and the have mores".  His energy policy was written with no input from environmentalists, while the CEO's of the nations major oil companies were invited to secret meetings at the White House with Dick Cheney, an unprecedented access to power.  Was anyone surprised when those companies who are enjoying record profits were the beneficiaries of munificent tax cuts at the tax-payers expense? Very little progress has been made in the last six years towards developing alternative sources of energy or increasing CAFE standards. I guess we will be drilling ourselves into oblivion. Bush and Cheney are consistent in one important way; they never forget who put them into office.      Bush is never held accountable in Barnes' mind for the debacle of Katrina. FEMA, which functioned efficiently during the Clinton years under James Lee Witt, was fused into the mammoth Dept.of Homeland Security.  Led by Michael Brown, a political hack who lacked the qualifications to run this key agency, FEMA became incapacitated by budget cuts and interagency in-fighting. No one holds Bush accountable for acts of nature, but a key function of government is to protect and defend its people. This was by all accounts, a failure of government at all levels.     Bush is also given a pass on his poorly-planned invasion of Iraq, and his failure to make the necessary personnel changes due to personal loyalty. Many have confused stubborness with steadfastness.  The most successful of our war time presidents -FDR, Lincoln, Wilson, Truman, have understood the need for a change of leadership at the top when the policy was failing. Instead, the public has been subjected to a pro-Iraq PR campaign that has never acknowledged the reality of the situation. Any nay-sayers were immediately attacked as traitors, discredited, or marginalized.  So this administration has put America in a situation with few options-if we stay the country will dissolve into warring factions, if we leave the country will dissolve into warring factions. Meanwhile the spectres of Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and Haditha will leave permanent scars upon the nation's psyche, cause incalculable harm to our image world-wide, and poison the very hearts and minds we seek to win. Conservatives, Barnes included, cannot admit this has been a catastrophic failure.     Finally, Barnes' premise that Bush is a rugged outsider in the vein of Ronald Reagan strikes me as ludicrous.  Bush, the son of a former president, who has led one of the most priviledged lives imaginable is as well-connected as one can imagine. He's never had to work, and didn't for many years, while struggling with multiple addictions. After having bottomed-out, he became a born-again evangelical. This accounts for his belief that he was appointed by G-d.  And who can question the policy of someone with such divine connections? Does this divinity also account for his arrogant refusal to entertain opposing points of view?  History will decide 
       This book is severely out of date, which is obvious from the techniques and methods it discusses that nobody uses any longer.  It is, in general, poorly written.  However, it does make a good doorstop.  It would be better if it were a little heavier.   
 The book is ok.  There are certainly good points.  The characters are extremely underdeveloped, however, and seem to be mere characatures. They could have been a lot better.  The book would definitely be better off as a film.    Fitzhugh also has some serious issues with New York City.  Unless there was a joke I missed, he must HATE it.  He spends 15-20% of the book describing how awful, dirty, and crime-filled it is.  All landlords are scummy, all the subway riders are crazy, or dirty, or "suits."  Cabbies carry guns and will use them, and so does everyone one else.  Even if this were still true, it detracts from the book 
 This was not what I expected. I normally read either to educate myself or to amuse myself. I think this failed in both areas. I could follow (but not necessarily agree with) his logic about value systems, but had difficulty as to how that all relates to consciousness. Other problamatic areas where when the author dismisses interiority or innerness of (among other things) an automobile or a battleship. I think a great many car owners and sailors would question that. I also am not as confident that a misquito feels no hunger pains as the author, and there are major world religions where some people drink only filterwd water in order to not hurt smaller creatures. Maybe this whole book was just over my (layman) head.I finally decided to stop chasing my tail and end the feedback.  The book binding though attractive, was sloppy and most pages were stuck together 
 A cartoonish and goofy lightweight assemblance of dullwitted alphanumberic characters attempting to relate something which in other hands would be an interesting topic 
 I bought this stroller for when we had our second child.  My children are 19 mo. apart.  I had the Aria single stroller for my first and loved it.  This one is definitely not the same.  For one thing, it is very hard to steer and get over bumps.  The wheels are always getting stuck.  Second, it is hard to close.  The most frustrating part is the steering issue.  Also, my Aria decal fell off as well many months ago.  I've only had the stroller for nine months.  One more thing, the canopy to block out the sun is basically worthless since it offers very little protection from the sun.   
 Gaining stardom in the television series PARTY OF FIVE and then gaining movie notoriety with the SCREAM series, Neve Campbell has never really achieved the status many had predicted.  Movies like LOST JUNCTION may be why.  Director Peter Masterson (The Trip to Bountiful) never seems to focus on what kind of movie he's created.  Is it one of those Southern film noir with the notorious femme fatale?  Is it a black comedy without any true laughs?  Or is it just simply a love story about two misguided people?  It's a combination of all of them.  Campbell is a femme of course, but I'm not sure she's too fatale.  She plays a Southern lass (with a really bad accent) who gives a lift to drifter Billy Burke (Ladder 49).  She then takes him to her bank and arranges to withdraw her total savings.  Seems that Missy (Miss Campbell) is married to someone named Doc, and he's off on a trip somewhere.  We know pretty soon, however, that Doc's body is in the trunk of her 1959 Cadillac.  So from there we're asked to discover how Doc died and whodunit.  Is it Missy's opportunistic boyfriend (Charles Powell, basically awful in his role); or did Missy herself bump him off?  The premise is a reworking of the ridiculous Dixie Chicks song, GOODBYE EARL.  You have an abusive spouse, so it's okay to kill him and get away with it.  One thing of note in this film is the casting of usual badguy Jake Busey as Burke's old friend who is crippled because Burke pushed him off a cliff into a quarry and who has been guilt-ridden ever since.  Once Busey is introduced (without the wild hair or manic look in his eyes), they don't know what to do with him so he just joins Burke as kind of a sidekick, but has nothing to contribute once the reunion occurs. LOST JUNCTION is a misguided, inconsistent film, with loads of atmosphere but no real substance, and an ending that is so preposterous, it's hard to believe 
 I've always enjoyed anything L.A. Graf writes concerning the original series, but this book was a disappointment to me. For one thing, they always have the same basic plot: get Sulu and Chekov (and others) into a desperate situation, beat the hell out of Chekov, and save the day in the end. This is not really a bad formula, but it gets old. Chekov couldn't possibly survive another book like this one, can he?  The entire Belle Terre idea is fascinating, so it's worth it to read the book for that. The Federation doesn't just fight Klingons and discover strange new worlds. It colonizes them, too, and it's really cool to see how this works.  In general, it's a well-written Star Trek book that's a nice break from your basic, daring deep-space episodes. And if you're a Chekov fan, you can't loose. Unless, of course, you're like me, and can't stand to see another woman move in. .  
 Yeah, I happen to agree that the Bush administration is incompetent. Bush spends like a drunken democrat (Teddy K.?) and he's even slower than Democrat John Conyers. Watching grass grow is more exciting than listening to Conyers string out a simple sentence for five minutes. I do give Bush credit for nominating Roberts and Alito to the Supreme Court. Maybe they can marginalize the ACLU witch Ginsberg who was foisted on us by the pathetic, zipper-challenged Clintoon. Dean comes across like a jailhouse snitch. So sneaky, the way he ratted out Nixon for glory. Let's face it - a little break-in to the dem headquarters to snoop around is nothing compared to Marxist Hillary hiring the hapless Livingstone to secretly peruse hundreds of confidential FBI files on Hill's "enemies. And they said Nixon was paranoid? Then there's Bill Clintoon selling secrets to China and pardoning drug runners like Dan Lassiter and neer-do-wells like Mark Rich and on and on ad infinitum. Dean is just insipid the way he lurks on the fringes waiting to capitalize on the misfortunes and screwups of others. The recycled title sounds so self serving - Hey, somebody look at me! I'm the selfless, heroic sneak who exposed Nixon and I need attention. Buy my book and line my pockets. So blatantly opportunistic-- all IMHO 
 I'm a fan of Koontz but this book was a disappointment. First of all it seems that not much happens. Molly, the main character, goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing. It's too cutesy with children and dogs (Koontz, please, the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired). For most of the book it would be a 3 star book, but the ending is too cheesy and religious. What will he write next? A "Left Behind" book 
 We bought also the keybord and the adapter (as recommended) and it does not fit. I already tried to buy a new one, but it is not available 
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 First CD of five titles this worthless fourth-rate glam metal band had bothered to put out.Cannot believe they lasted that long.I remember seeing these guys open for Alice Cooper on his 'Trash' tour.Talk about your suck-support acts.Simply love some of the song titles here,like their Mtv video "Naughty Naughty" and "Bang Bang".Like,how long did it take for them to think those up?Other hair bands I don't care for include Trixter,Warrant(after CD no.2)and Firehouse.Total waste of time,money and effort.I've heard some patrons compare this band to the likes of White Lion,Faster Pussycat or Poison.Don't you dare!Danger Danger doesn't EVEN come close.Avoid at all costs 
 This has to be one of the most simplistic books I have ever read.  It reminds me of one of those biographies written by a not-to-bright athelete "as told to" a mediocre small town newspaper writer.  I think that Ms Garrett wrote the book because she needed money. Derek Bloomfiel 
 When I was 15 and first discovering guitar, I loved this album. Listening to it now, it just sounds incredibly soulless and cheesy.Vai is technically very impressive, but the man can't write a decent song to save his life. Vai's modus operandi is to get a bunch of faceless studio musicians, lay down a generic rhythm track, and go wheedily wheedily wheedily whee for an entire album.  Technique on your instrument is never a bad thing, however, technique should be just a means to an end, not the end itself. And that's what no shred guitarist seems to understand. The fact that shred guitarists like Vai aren't more popular is due to one thing: they're more concerned about playing faster and more cleanly than the next guy rather than writing songs. There's a GOOD REASON why non-guitarists hate this stuff.  Basically, once you get past the "Gee, that's neat" factor, this album, and nearly all of Vai's music, feels incredibly stiff and lifeless.To be blunt, this is what John Tesh or Yanni would sound like if they played guitar rather than keyboards. Not only that, his guitar tone is absolutely awful. Very thin, high pitched, and brittle sounding.  The best thing on here is the blatant Van Halen rip-off "The Audience is Listening": the rest is just masturbation. Vai's best work has always been as a sideman, especially the stuff he did with David Lee Roth, because then he's forced to play actual SONGS, rather than 5 minute long, tedious guitar solos. On his own, he's just unbearable. I considered giving this one star, but I gave it 2 stars due to the fact that Vai CAN play, it's just WHAT he's playing that's the problem. 
 I agree with the review that say it sound like a coffee grinder.  And we also made all the adjustments.  Our cat is terrified of it and has opted for drinking the Christmas tree water instead.  It was in a room several rooms away from our bedroom and it kept me up all night.  I'm throwing it out tonight 
 This vision of the future reminded me of common errors on physics tests where the student leaves out a variable or two and makes a wildly incorrect prediction of an object's future behavior.  People have many connections to a place, which do not depend merely on their own security or on currency fluctuations.  These emotional and cultural connections will keep people from being entirely atomized and "at-will" citizens for a long time to come.  In reading the book, by the way, the style will annoy some rewaders in that it is not written in the modern, American style where predictions would be tied back to and grounded in data and trends.  It's much more in an old fashioned English amateur gentleman scholar style where nothing is substantiated by anything and it's all sort of breezy.  Some may like that.  
   Does anyone actually listen to this before they make it into CD's?  This is the poorest quality band music I've ever heard!  The EQ is moronic.  The high end needs to be cut by at least 12 db's.  The fidelity is lousy.  Sounds like it was recorded with one microphone, and there is definately some clipping going on.  How could Altissimo do this to this great music?? 
 This is the story of Cassie, who is found wandering helplessly in a cemetery by a young Indian policeman who just arrived in LA. Cassie suffers from amnesia and we don't know what brought her there, until a hollywood megastar recognizes her as his wife.  This is by far the most disappointing of Picoult's books, and I've read almost all of them and am a big fan of hers. Cassie is amnesic, yet she does remember stuff and it is not clear at all in the book how comes she recovers from her amnesia or actually how it happened. The story goes back and forth between the present, the past, the memories, and leaves readers lost in the middle.  I was surprised by other reviewers who were surprised by the ending. Chapter one gives the ending away in my opinion. What is frustrating is that it takes Picoult 350 pages to make her character realise the obvious.  I also found Cassie to be unreliable and unappealing, let alone her husband Alex, a massive egocentric. The story was very confused, mixing hollywood lifestyle with movie sets in Africa, with anthropology, Indian legends, domestic violence, alcoholism, amnesia - it was just too much for one book and the message was confused.   If you want a superb story of domestic violence, read Black & Blue by Anna Quindlen. If you want a good Picoult book, read The Pact or My Sister's Keeper, but definitely not Picture Perfect 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 As a cat lover, I've enjoyed the Cat Who... books immensely.  However, this book left me with a lot of questions, and there were several items mentioned that were never resolved.  Homer Tibbet had been a prominent character in many of that series of books, he dies, and that's the last mention of him.  Surely, James MacIntosh Qwilleran would have attended his funeral!  Same thing for Liz Hart.  She's killed in a car accident, and that's the last we hear of her.  What about the impact of her death on Derek Cuttlebrink,another prominent character in this series?  We've read all these books, these characters have become important to us, and suddenly we're left hanging in these relationships.  I'll continue to read the new books, but they're clearly not what they were even 3 or 4 years ago 
 Recently i've been looking to buy a cheap curling iron. i came across this one and thought vidal sassoon was a brand that's been around for a while. well. after "curling" my hair it just looked like i poorly straightend it. seriously. i am taking this back immediatly. don't waist your money or your time on this. maybe if you have thinner hair it would work. i dont know. 
 This one is for you.  But honestly now, the guy doesn't write--beautiful voice--but songwriting is a major appeal.  So  guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above Justin Timberlake.  Ok, there are definitely highlihgts like a Heart in Newyork, (what a) wonderful world, but generally this a very casual compilation, good for a couple listens.  in general, Art Garfunkel isn't really good for more than that.  Check out him witht Paul Simon, that is amazing stuff, but this is kinda boring.  I might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs--but even though there are good songwriters writing for him, the songs are still sub-par 
 TEMP READING CONSTANTLY OFF BY MINIMUM OF 10 DEGREES. I WAS WARNED. 
 I usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad.  It was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were.  Of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin.  The dialogues were stilted. There was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books.  I agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book.  I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo 
 I'm an amateur photographer and I use Photoshop CS2 for most of my digital editing.  I decided I needed a colorimeter based on the recommendations of many books that I have read on digital editing.    I had to download an update of the software program before I could start using my Spyder.  This procedure alone took several hours because I kept getting "error" messages.  I can't count how many times I unloaded and reloaded the program.  I was eventually able to run the program, however, every time I calibrated my one year old Emachine CRT monitor, it left me with an orange color cast on my screen.  I worked with ColorVision technical support for many frustrating hours.  The technical support person I was working with was very pleasant and really tried to help me.  They even mailed me a new sensor because they thought the first one was defective.  Unfortunately I was unable to get the orange color cast removed from my monitor.  After several weeks of trying to get the Spyder2 Express to calibrate my monitor, I gave up.  I just didn't want to spend any more time trying to get it to work so it was returned.  I really wanted it to work.  I'm back to using Adobe Gamma.     
 Let me begin by saying that I absolutely love travel/adventure books, especially books at sea.  So I was really looking forward to this book.  I have never read a book more disappointing.  The writing is almost impossible to follow.  The setting (North Sea during Winter with tremendous storms) should have been spellbounding.  Instead most of the book involves long discourses between crewmembers as if no one is listening to the other person.  I believe only once does the author go above board and then only for a brief spell during a storm.  This book is not worth reading. 
 In my opinion this was not a good book. If it hadn't been such a short read I probably wouldn't have been able to finish it. Maybe the movie is better 
 This books attempts to be: 1)	A college selection and admission guide; 2)	A self help manual on how to thrive during your college years; 3)	A financial planning guide focused on how to finance college; 4)	A guide to college majors; and 5)	A career counseling guide  This is four books too many.  The author was clearly not able to handle this All-in-One formula.  He should have focused on the first theme: a regular college selection and admission guide.  This is a complex enough material for most authors and readers.    As a result of the author's strategy of Jack-of-all-trades but Masters of none, he really failed at covering any of the five topics mentioned in adequate depth.  The book for the most part is devoid of any insights beyond common sense and common knowledge.  In addition, the book is stuffed with typos, errors, and incorrect judgments.    For instance, on page 39 and 40 the author shares a basic list of his favorite schools.  But, most of them are misclassified.  He classifies the University of Chicago as a small liberal arts college.  Meanwhile, it is a national university with masters and doctorate programs that liberal arts colleges do not have.  On page 39, he classifies Grinnell as a good liberal arts college for B students.  On the next page, he classifies the exact same school as a good school for unconventional students with a GPA of A.  Well, is Grinnell a school for A or B students?  The author does not know.  An example of poor judgment is his unqualified promotion of using the Common Application for convenience.  If you want to get into a selective school, don't use the Common Application; it will clearly lower your chance of getting accepted.  The school will perceive you as too lazy to even make the effort to use the school's customized application format.  Later, he promotes Canadian schools as a superior college education at a below market cost.  This is a mirage.  First, Canadian schools are for the most part huge (20,000 to 40,000 plus students).  Their standard class size is often 100+.  Their student/teacher multiple is way higher than anything you see in the U.S.  Also, their out-of-country tuition has skyrocketed lately, and is often much higher than out-of-state tuition for public schools.  In summary, Canadian schools don't compare well in both cost and quality vs. good public school systems like the UCs and University of Michigan.  He gives completely wrong advice on Early Action.  He discourages it because he thinks the admission standard is tougher than for regular admission.  He is wrong.  Applying Early Action gives you the equivalent of a 70-point boost on the old SAT scale.  For confirmation, check the excellent book "The Early Admission Game."  He overstates the case for community colleges.  He states they have better professors and smaller classes than four-year institutions.  Based on feedback from friends who did go to community colleges this is never the case.  Community colleges are a wonderful opportunity for students who have no other opportunities for financial or academic reasons.  But, they are no great shake for too many other people.    The Appendix B, a list of 434 colleges is useless.  It is like a phone book list that is not even in alphabetical order.  Additionally, based on all the mistakes he made on his short list on page 39 and 40, I would not even trust he got the name and phone numbers right of the respective schools he mentions.  This list is associated with no qualitative information or insight whatsoever.  You have no idea if he really likes or recommends them.  There is also no information to truly differentiate them except for location and estimated costs.    His sections on career counseling and school majors are so poor they are almost laughable.  The author's main message, lost in a sea of errors, is that the college fit and what you will study and do in college are far more important than the college brand name.  This is a true and laudable message.  Unfortunately, many authors have already said it in a much more informative and convincing way than he did.  These include the following ones who wrote excellent books that I do recommend:   Jay Matthews "Harvard Schmarvard" Howard and Matthew Greene, "The Public Ivies," "Inside the Top Colleges," and "The Hidden Ivies."  Loren Pope, "Looking Beyond the Ivy League."    
 I'm sure this was a great book, 8 years ago (i'd give it 4 stars then), but it's taken me forever to get through the book when every other technique is a film-specific technique like "duplicating slides", "pushing film, or "cross-processing", or is referring to specific cameras, film types, etc to get desired results. most of this can be done in photoshop with one dslr and a couple lenses. thankfully, i just saw that Frost has released a new version of this book specific to digital photography. i probably wouldn't buy it though. i hope i can sell this used 
 My best USB drive is the Lexar Media JDE512-231 JumpDrive Elite USB 2.0 512MB drive which I had for about a year and a half. But I needed more space, so I thought I would buy this as the upgrade since it's made by the same company and has the same brand name and they don't make the other model in 1 G anymore. This drive is very slow. I timed the same backup procedure on both drives, and my older 512 MB was at least twice as fast 
 some explanation.  I am having this terrible time of getting past the first few pages of this book.  So help me those of you who own refrigerators.  If you, or some unknown enemy, shuts down your "at work" fridge late on Saturday, and you for some unknown and bevildering (but deep, yeah deep and unfathomable) reason wake up at 4 A.M. on Sunday to go to work, do you think that at 6 A.M. you wouldn't be able to enter your workplace because of the PUTRID stench from your perishables?  I don't know about you but one of my problems with my fridge is the time it takes to thaw before I clean it.  Never, ever, has it made my food putrid in less than 12 hours.  And for some reason, I don't know why, I thought that fridges were as close to airtight as you could get, you know, to hold in all that cold air you pay electricity bills to produce.  FOR CRYING OUT LOUD WHY NOT MAKE IT A WEEK or better yet, a month.  And will somebody explain also why the author hates her sleuth so  much she makes her dumb enough to wake up at 4 A.M. to go to work when she clearly has not enough to do.  I mean Goldy gets knocked out, calls the police, calls Tom, calls Marla, goes in and cleans up her catering place while simultaneously getting rid of dozens of mice AND MAKES UP A WHOLE NEW BATCH OF LUNCH FROM BEGINNING TO FINISH.  If she had time for all that, why not wake up at 6 A.M.? I hate stupid books and this one makes it to the top of  the list.  However, I will get past page 20 if somebody explains to me why the laws of physics and common sense don't apply in America 
 Do what thou Wilt shall be the whole of the Law!  This book was sent to me by a Missonary she was hoping it wpi;d make me think about the christian god more.  My biggest compliant, outside of the utterly poor logic and poor grasp of Science, was the Bait and Switch additude.  I flipped to the biggest questions I had. Only to see the author say. "What people actually mean by this is..." Repeated several times. I don't have my copy, an older edition I believe, on me to do a direct quote.  Basicly useing this trick the book danced around many of the harder questions leaveing them unaswered. If anything this book convinced me too stay on the Occult path dispite feelings of longing for Crist I had at the time. Too date I haven't regretted that choice.  The really seems more aimed, like many apologetics, at boosting the moral of fellow christians and those just starting to slid away rather than bringing those that have lost faith or are not christian into the fold.  Love is the Law. Love under Will 
 The photo presented here is a bit too bright and the faces are not that orange in this paperback edition's cover. However you can get a feel for the checked floor and how after opening the pages of The Doorbell Rang you get an eye sore with the blue checkered tablecloth in the kitchen with the blue stove and red appliances. The mother and daughter are both redheads and there is a black cat that hangs around during the story that takes place in the kitchen.   With just twenty pages my seven-year old breezed through the book in six minutes. The favorite character in the book according to my son is the cat and watching where he was throughout the story. The Doorbell Rang begins with a Mother placing a plate of cookies on the kitchen table for her son Sam and daughter Victoria. " I've made some cookies for tea, said Ma". The children each took six cookies comparing the look and smell of these cookies to Grandma's.  By flipping through the pages of the Doorbell Rang it looks like the kitchen table got bigger, but upon further inspection the same number of chairs are there, but more kids around the table and fighting over the seats. The cat is making his way around the kids to receive pats on the head and attention. More kids arrived bringing a bicycle and a doll carriage and the table shows each kid with one cookie. It is hard to tell if the cookies are on white plates or that is just part of the checkered tablecloth. The serving plate is clearly empty at this point and all the kids turn to see the latest bell ringer. Meanwhile over at the stove the steam is continuing but at a larger pace and it looks like fresh water now in the orange pail.   The final arrival for this story is Grandma, with a large cookie sheet type tray carrying freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. All the kids leave the table to greet her and the cat ends up alone on the kitchen table. Not very sanitary as far as I am concerned and my son noticed no napkins or drinks at the table. The dirty floor was bothering him as well and he wondered why the kids never took their shoes off for that is something we all do upon entering our home.    The portrayal of the Mother and how the stove was not being attended and having the cat on the table bothered me. The kids not stopping to wipe their feet or hanging up their own belongings and no one washing their hands before having a cookie and who knows how many times the kids each touched one of them.   At least the kids were dressed nice and the bucket of water never spilled and the Mother finally sat down. For a new reader this might be a fun read but for more than one read I highly doubt there would be interest. There is a lot of repetition with the arrival of new kids and then the sharing of the cookies while comparing them to each child's Grandma's cookies. There are roughly two to four sentences on each page. The good news is that my son did not ask for any cookies after reading this 
 I don't think their is much to add to my title, other than this is just more lunacy from the same hatemonger who wrote "race traitor 
 Just STOP listening to music altogether. PLEASE, PLEASE JUST STOP SMOKING HIS POLE AS WELL, ITS CLEARLY EVIDENT IN YOUR REVIEW.  To everyone else, listen to all of Eminem's albums before this one. Actually you probably have unless you live in a bubble.  That is all 
 Man, what monastery did these guys crawl out of? We have optical and radio telescopes these days; why not look for example of your conjectures elsewhere in the solar system? The psalmist says, "The imbecile contemplates that there is no Elohim". And isn't that the point? In their zeal to undercut the most compelling scientific argument against evolution, we're now to believe that "Mother Nature" abhors a gradient. And, somehow we're to believe that the existence of life is just an efficient means of dissipating energy? C'mon guys! Is that the best you've got? I'm sure this argument appeals to true believers, but its presentation in "Into the Cool: Energy Flow, Thermodynamics, and Life" must make most objective scientists cringe. In fact, it will probably make them think about how life really did come about for the first time in their lives. In that sense, it's the only commendable aspect of your bound speculations. I'll be thinking about your latest contribution in support of the Darwinian religion the next time I pour cold cream in my hot coffee .... Hahaha 
 This book is a huge disappointment.  The cover is modern and promises a high-quality treatment of an interesting subject but the inside is ridiculously simplistic and leaves an awful lot to the reader to figure out on his own.  The extremely abbreviated text is arcane and the "pictures" are no more than primitive line drawings.  In many cases, this is woefully inadequate to understand what's going on.  This 1868 book belongs in the "Antiques" section.  It was a huge disappointment and simply annoying 
 While the information and comparisons to his father's climb were insightful and interesting, I was put off by the author's comments on Americans and the spirituality of America. This book was more about Buddism and its practice than a climbing adventure.  The descriptions of Buddhist customs are informative, but this reader did not appreciate the tone which came across in these sections. As both a Jew and an American, I felt like I was being disrespected when I read it 
 This book was a waste of money!  The forms and checklists are great, but it lacks a lot of other important information.  I would suggest "How to List and Sell Real Estate in the 90's" by Daniell Kennedy, it is  very motivational and packed with excellant information 
 This book is basically a series of quoted and sited magazine articles hastily cobbled together into a book.  The only "real" interviews done by the author are with a few eBay customers who use the site.  The author admits no one with eBay granted him an interview or let him in the building.  For a much better story of how eBay came to be, read eBoys by Robert Stross 
 I read so many good reviews of this book that I had to get it for the Halloween season. It begins with an interesting and mysterious premise but soon evolves into pages of story with little excitement. I am at the last 5o pages of the book and perhaps I will find out why everyone else found this book so good. An antique book seller and his daughter operate a dusty old shop with valuable books. The daughter is invited by one of the top authors of the day to write her biography although she has been a recluse and resists others attempts to find out the truth of her life. The common thread between the author and biographer is that they are both twins. I am married to an identical twin and I am baffled by the excessive concentration on this one topic. Wait for it to go on the discount table 
 As already noted, there are several very good songs omitted from the soundtrack. The 1st one that comes to my mind is "Uncle John's Band" by the Grateful Dead. This compilation is a poor effort by the producers, who obviously either didn't live through the late 60's or they were too messed up to notice 
 Having been a teenager once, I can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience.  However, in PUMP UP THE VOLUME, the movie's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens.  The teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior.  Even our hero (well played by Christian Slater) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level; he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them.  As a proponent of truth, he is a vapid antithesis of truth: he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths; he doesn't use his real name or voice; and on a call with a potential suicide victim, he treats the caller as someone who isn't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation.  The suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure, but isn't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise?  The adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes.  Sorry, folks, been there done that...living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right.  Questioning authority without any viable alternatives, as none of these teens do, merely escalates the generational gap, and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth 
 This is without a doubt one of the most boring books I have ever read.  You need to take notes to understand it.  It is very disjointed; it feels like a bunch of different chapter articles bound together in book form. It deals with a fascinating subject; it is a pity that it was not better written because it could have been an excelent book.  This may be the fault of the editor rather than the writer; she certainly needed some expert help with making her chapters fit together in a cohesive manner 
 Why do I own a thunderstorm CD? I don't know. I guess I thought it would be something different, something ambient and *natural.* This disc has one long, poorly-recorded thunderstorm, followed by 23 lighting strikes. None of it is worth buying or hearing 
 This movie freely abuses the name of an ancient emperor of India while peddling a low-brow bollywood song-and-dance entertainer. This is neither the story of Ashoka nor reflective of any sort of history. Shah Rukh Khan for all his merits as an actor simply does not fit and the whole Kareena Kapoor cavorting in wet clothes is so over the top as to make one cringe. Best avoided 
 Although I love the Firm, this one is not my favorite.It is a good workout,there is just something about it...it drags.Perhaps Ms DelRio is not quite as toned as one would hope..I don't know.At one point she has her eyes shut while she squats.I have dozens of Firms and some with this instructor, that I like.It seems that most Firm videos have a way of tricking you into working out hard before you know it, but this one falls short in some indescribable way 
 I had high hopes for this book. I sit disappointedly writing this brief review, as there is not really much to say, precisely because the author does not say or do much. In fact, he makes the whole point of the book his failed attempts at writing two actual books: one a novel, the other a book about DH Lawrence. "Rage" is used appropriately in the title, as kind of a double entendre for the author's rage at his own inabilities, but it also references DH Lawrence's own quote regarding his attempt at writing a book on Thomas Hardy.  While the author's writing style appeals to me, it is drudgery to get through this, unless you're a crazy, procrastinating, lazy, neurotic nut like the author.  I read books to be swept along, and my disappointment here lies in the fact that the book sweeps you into the life of the author, which is depressing and weird. Plus, it's pretty hostile in there.  If you can read detatchedly and you enjoy frustration and hostility, go for it 
 ABC-CLIO STEALS FROM THEIR AUTHORS, PAYS THEM NOTHING, AND ROBS THEM BLIND. DO NOT PURCHASE BOOKS FROM THEM OR FROM THEIR SUBSIDIARIES. BOYCOTT THESE THIEVES!! 
 This book turned out to be another release of the original book from the 1980s and it shows.  It is full of seriously outdated information and old style, pushy, boiler-room style telemarketing tactics.  Worst of all, it tells you to always push for the appointment and end the conversation there.  What about qualifying?  I can already set appointments all day if I don't bother to qualify them, but unfortunately those unqualified appointments don't buy.  Save your money and find a more up to date sales book 
 what a crock of ****. the only good thing is that it still has the story with tommy and thats it,,, the kills suck, the plot sucks,acting really sucks, and damnit no jason 
 This book was recommended to me by a relative, and I purchased it based on her suggestion. It was disappointing when I realized within a few pages that its viewpoints relate more closely to a fundamentalist/conservative slant than to the God of my faith. I offered the book to another family member, with brief comments that I didn't care for it much. She suggested that I should be more open-minded. Yikes! That is exactly the opposite of my problem with this book. For example, it seems to me that a person who is open-minded just isn't going to be inspired by the statement that "God isn't who we want him to be." In my opinion, God is more perfect than we can fathom, and that IS precisely who we want Him to be 
 After the success of 8 mile, it was obvious that hollywood would make a clone to cash in. The movie certainly looks very cheap, nothing spectacular, not even in the shootings.  The story is predictable 50 cents' mother is killed when he is young, he gets tough, kind of wanting to avenge his mom, becomes a gangster, then a better gangster because his mentor gangster is good at this gangster-job.  Predictably, 50 goes to jail, remembers his lost dream of being a rapper, though it was never clear that he wanted to be a rapper. of course he must fight his former crime buddies because no one can "retire" from crime, as we know from countless mafia movies.  In the movie as in real life, 50 cent IS a speech impaired rapper, he just mumbles through his songs. This is addressed in the movie, and for fans this brings value to the film, we see 50 struggling with his own lack of clarity.  There is a strange side-story in the movie that is not persued and does not add anything, which is sad, because it had real potential. In the movie, 50s mom is killed and until the end we don't know who did it, but it turns out that the two main suspects might also be 50s dad, and in the end it looks like his dad killed his mom, and there could have been some nice struggle in the possible dads over all this. In fact in connection with this side plot we have the movie's one ray of light: Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaie, who plays Majestic, the afformentioned good at gangsterism gangster. He is a superb actor, outclassing anything in the movie (including "Bana" played by the excellent actor from Hustle and Flow). If he was white he would be hailed as the next young Brando, he's that good. Sadly, trapped in this aweful movie he has to give terrible lines. His subtle struggle, not knowing if he is 50s dad, is drowned out, because one does not look for good acting a movie like this. I first noticed this actor in The Bourne Identity (the matt damon one), where he has a small role, but steals every scene he is in. I found the ending the worst part, because as 50 finally makes it onto stage, the winner, the hero, stepping into the limelight, he falls totally flat. just a muscle bound guy with no expression, and oddly no pressence, inspite of his bulked up, schwarzenegger body. Perhaps this total lack of pressence is part of his appeal. Eric B. and rakim, where are you?  So if you love 50, you might get something out of this, otherwise stay away, if you are forced to watch it, keep an eye on majestic.  
 [This review contains NO spoilers.]  Sublime is a movie about a man that goes in for a colonoscopy and wakes up having found out that there was a mix-up and the wrong procedure was performed. It follows his struggles after this to just get out of the hospital with strange things going on around him with his care and the rest of the hospital. That's the plot in a nutshell.  A movie like this where the main character is confused about what is going on (and the audience views the film through that character's eyes - without any outside narration or the POV of other characters) hinges on how the situation unfolds and what the eventual outcome is. For instance, a mystery novel needs to have a satisfying trail of clues and a satisfying payoff where the mystery is solved at the end. In this respect, I think this movie fails. The trail of clues was poor in that I was pretty sure exactly what the situation was pretty early on in the movie. (I won't say anymore than that because I do not want to spoil it for anyone.) The solution at the end of the film was also uninspired. The entire buildup of the film leads to no real payoff.  Another aspect of this movie that I did not like was the heavy-handed treatment given to "the message" in it. The filmmakers want to make a point regarding fear in our society and how white males cower in fear all the time. It's a point I'm not particularly impressed with for depth of thought and I was not impressed with the execution of it given how thick it was laid on the audience. I tired of it quickly.  I did find the makeup showing the maladies affecting the main character to be quite effective. That was well done. I also thought that the atmosphere in the film was well done. The hospital has an appropriate creepy feeling for what is going on. And the acting was also quite good too. I've long been a fan of Tom Cavanagh and it was interesting to see him in a role that is not traditional for him. Very nice surprise and excellent work on his part.  With those positives being said, they do not make up for the poor story and overkill with the message of the film (to the point where I felt belittled by it) and so I am only giving Sublime 2 stars.  sincerely, R.C 
 I admit I am a resident of the South - Alabama to be exact.  But when I purchased this book, I sincerely wanted to read a story about sailing for a year in the Bahamas.  Sadly, this book is more about a spoiled couple that spends about 25% of the time telling you how scared they are about every aspect of the trip and 50% of the time criticizing the social conditions of the "South" as they travel down the ICW on the East Coast.  The other 25% of the time is spent talking about random ideas with a few sentences of the sailing trip they are supposedly on.  By page 70 I was tired of their liberal slant on a part of the US they claim to be "from".  Message to the author, I live in Birmingham.  Rosa Parks made her heroic stand against racial injustice in Montgomery.  Simple facts like this seem to be trivial to the authors who are more concerned with expressing their overall disgust with a South that has seemingly not changed much since the days of slavery.  Well, I certainly wouldn't say everything is perfect here, but as the authors admit, nowhere is perfect.  The Southeast is one of the fastest growing regions for economical development and changes are taking place.  Birmingham does boast to be the birth place for Civil Rights and we have an excellent Civil Rights museum that I have taken the time to actually visit to learn of the past injustices with the hope that I will be part of a better place for all.  I resent being lectured to by the main author who evidently loves his teaching job.  And if he does want to lecture this Southerner, I would expect him to take time to at least learn some of the more major details of the Civil Rights movement.    Very little sailing story.  Lots of liberal opinions spewed forth as though they were facts when even his facts are wrong.  If you want to read about a sailing story....buy Sailing the Dream.  I am going to return my copy of this book to the author.  I may even take a red pen and mark all of his errors.  I would give him a grade of "F" if I were his professor 
 I bought this book looking for some helpful advice for when our first son arrived.  I did not find it with this book.  This book is just a couple's stories about life with their first.  Somewhat interesting but not at all what I was looking for 
 I suppose that if you've read Homecoming you have no choice but to read the Farther Shore.  Unfortunately, I quickly felt that I was reading this sequel out of necessity rather than for pleasure.  The problem lies with Golden's emphasis on secondary characters.  I'm sorry, but I didn't buy a Voyager book to read about Harry's girlfriend and all of her cohorts that Voyager's crew hasn't seen for the past 7 years, if ever, to the neglect of the crew.  The plot eventually comes back around to our heroes, but by that point I was just about ready to put the book down and forget about it in favor of the Voyager DVD set.  And that's a shame, considering how much I enjoyed Christie's Homecoming.  Here's hoping the author's next venture follows the Homecoming model rather than that of the Farther Shore 
 I bought this album because i loved their self titled debut. Unfortunately, it really is nothing like their first album. There is only a hint of bluegrass sound, Chris Thile's vocals are straying into an alt-pop sound, and frankly, many of the lyrics are painfully insipid. Too bad, their first album was (and still is) one of my favorites. If you liked Nickel Creek (the album) for it's unique sound, don't buy this one 
 This book is written assuming that you already know what went on, and fails to explain the details. I know that Carlyle was trying to re-invent the way we write history, but the book is practically unreadible 
 My 4 year old daughter had no fear at nighttime until this book was read in preschool. Now she wakes at night and tells us that there are nightmares in her closet. We tell her that it was only a story and that stories aren't all real, but that doesn't take away the basic idea she is developing about things happening while we (mom and dad included) sleep. Fancy telling us that once the boy has dealt with one monster, another is lurking. It implies an endless stream of nightmares waiting to happen... 
 I used to like this film back in the late 80s but after purchasing it, reading the book and watching it again I realized that there isn't much to say that is redeeming of this film. Sure it's low budget, but the story and characters are so cheesy and NOT in a good b movie way. I guess this film will still have it's fans but after reading the book (I dont normally compare books to films because its downright impossible to compare) I found the characters just not that likeable and the ending is very ridiculous. For a film to achieve cult status isn't too hard if its a b movie but whether its a good film or not is the real question. As for me I rate this low because I find it atrocious but for it's fans, the ones out there that REALLY love this film and call it a "classic" I must say I hope some day they remake the story with better actors, effects and plotting 
 There's no rules for title pages, no examples of manuscript pages, no rules for pagination. It doesn't even tell you if the reference list belongs on a separate page or what its heading looks like. I consider these glaring omissions, particularly if you are expected to use pure APA and have no departmental style guide (like me). This book is basically a glorified guide to citation and syntactic rules. Avoid it and pay the extra five bucks for the complete book. Getting the cheap book as some kind of protest won't signficantly hurt the APA and it will just make things harder for you 
 This book came highly recommended so I was looking forward to it but ended up very disapointed.  First off, this is a very thin, large font, tons of white space excuse for a book - there is very little to it and it isn't worth 5 bucks much less the list price of 20.  The book is fluffy, trite and idealistic at best.  The entire gist of the book is covered here in the Amazon description and all the value is there as well - no need to buy the book.  Skip this one 
 That should have been the title of this movie as it describes the use that the talents of a high-profile cast & normally respectable director are put to.  Another possible title is "It's All About the Groceries", 'cause I'm hard-pressed to think of a reason, other than money, why anybody involved would've signed on to this project.  It starts promisingly, with atmospheric shots of the Golden Gate Bridge rising through fog over San Francisco.  The camera plunges through the fog to hone in on the image of a knife being held to a woman's throat. Once again, Ashley Judd is a victim in jeopardy . . .so it seems.  Then the 'victim' proceeds to open a can of whoop-a** all over the perpetrator and beats him to a bloody pulp.  One starts to think that this might be getting good, especially after Ashley's apparently super-competent police detective is revealed to have anger issues, a pretty hefty drinking problem, a propensity for picking up strangers in bars & having rough sex with them . . .and some grisly skeletons in her closet.  I was interested to see what Judd would do with this opportunity to play a character with a dark side instead of her usual noble victim.  Unfortunately, not enough.  Ms. Judd is a luminously beautiful actress, even with a severe short haircut meant to make her look tough, I suppose. It is not hard to believe that men would be drawn to her like bugs to a flame.  She has not developed the range of emotion to really carry a complex character like Jessica, though, playing it distressingly one-note.  Is she ecstatic?  Depressed?  In a drug-induced stupor?  The way Judd plays it, it could be any, or all, of the above.  I like Ashley Judd, but she is in danger of turning into the female version of Richard Gere--a performer with real potential who keeps choosing flashy junk-food roles that do not challenge her talent.  "Kiss the Girls" was the high-water mark & each subsequent film has been weaker than the last.  This movie is worth the price of a rental, but I'd take a pass on purchasing it.  For a better treatment of female-cop-with-dark-secrets-and-Issues, & a stronger movie all-around, I recommend "Murder by Numbers" with Sandra Bullock 
 I have used lots of PrintMaster versions I had some trouble with version 16 with the address book so I was happy to find that a new version was out and called to order they told me I wouldn't have a problem with the new one.  This new version is JUNK; all the projects have to be downloaded so if you don't have a high speed connection forget it!  I don't like the fact that you have to go on line every time you want to create a card etc.  I sent a note to customer service and just received a generic response.  So looks like I have to find new software 
 It's too bad that those responsible for releasing Stones complilations can't seem to find (or bother to remaster like the Beatles re-releases) Stereo versions of all of their 60's material. Anybody listening to this collection on a  good modern system will find some of the early tracks painfull and muddled. Even the later tracks chosen are the edited versions. Uneven releases by those controlling the Stones catalog are common. For example, every track on the Stones UK Aftermath release are in true stereo and sound crystal clear conversly all the songs on both versions of Out of Our Heads were released in mono only (remaster!). Talk about an uneven treatment of a catalog. There are no excuses why the best possible versions of every song could have been included in this release- they haven't, therefore the low rating. 
 It is time for white people (and particularly someone who lives in Portland, Oregon, American's whitest large city) to get over this ridiculously juvenile infatuation for self-loathing, guilt, and self-hatred (the unbearable whiteness of being). No intelligent person who actually knows about the real history of the U.S. denies that America IS, to be sure, a racist and imperialist society, but writing 500 + pages that make the same claim (history is told from the standpoint of the victors; we've all been brainwashed by the history taught in schools) over and over again is not going to improve or promote racial understanding. Furthermore, any intelligent person knows that prior to Columbus's 'discovery' indigenous people did not live in 'complete harmony' so people who quote Chomsky, Zinn, et al. endlessly are just as brainwashed as people who do not read revisionist history. It is time to focus on the many positive accomplishments minorities have made and all the progress that has come (and still needs to come). Finally, anyone who spells America 'Amerikkka' does not deserve to have her work taken seriously. Enough said 
 Scholinski attempts to attack the mental health field in her memoir "The Last Time I Wore a Dress." She asserts that she was held through her teenage years because she was not feminine enough in the eyes of idiot doctors. However, I found little evidence of her tomboy nature contributing to her hospitalization. Scholinski never considers the consequences of her actions, she is dishonest, histrionic, and self-absorbed. It is a lack of maturity, not femininity that causes Scholinski's downfall. Amazingly, Scholinski never sees her actions as having anything to do with the state of her existence. This short, simple, and repetitive novel is a memoir of denial 
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 OMIFG! This was one of THE worst movies ever made! Me and my cousin watched it last night, and were crackinig up, the script is hilarious! Who actually talks like that?! We watched it for a half hour only because we wanted to see if it would get any better, uhhh...sadly, no. We watched "American Beauty" instead *brilliant.* I really loved James Marsden in "Gossip"-which was an excellent movie, but the only thing 'disturbing' about this was the writing. Like James, l also liked his weird friend in "Wasted" but not at all in this. I love Katie Holmes, but even she couldn't help this project, talk about a WASTE OF FILM MONEY AND TIME 
 You have to understand: I am not an Adam Sandler fan. I didn't like him on Saturday Night Live. I don't like his stand-up comedy. I didn't like Happy Gilmore. I didn't like Waterboy. I didn't like Mr. Deeds. (Though... I did like the Wedding Singer, but I take that as the exception that proves the rule...) It was to be expected, going in, that I wouldn't like Billy Madison. And, I didn't.  But maybe you *are* an Adam Sandler fan, like the friend of mine who convinced me to take this chance on Sandler. If so, you'll probabaly really like this movie (it's his favorite of the Sandler films). I'd say that, if you're a Sandler fan, you can add two stars to my review for a total of four.  Sandler is really himself in this film, doing his schtick. For instance, early on he sings a pointless, off-key ode to sunscreen. Sandler fans find that kind of thing funny; I don't. I think that's the barometer for this movie--ask yourself: guy singing about sunscreen, just 'cause. Funny? If so, get this movie.  To get into specifics, Billy Madison is about the title character (Sandler), heir to his father's multi-million dollar corporation, who is in danger of losing out on his inheritance because he's uneducated and unmannered and, in general, a big layabout who spends his days sunbathing and drinking (and singing about sunscreen). Billy makes a deal with his dad that the business will go to him if he manages to pass each grade, 1-12, with 2 weeks for each grade. I hope I'm not spoiling too much to say that: Billy wins in the end, gets the girl (a very hot elementary school teacher) and sticks it to the bad guy (an unscrupulous businessman, scheming to "steal" the business away from Billy).  I found the plot unrealistic. What the hell does it mean to "pass" 12th grade in 2 weeks... and more than that, Madison starts out unable to spell the word "rock" (his version: "rok"); do we really believe he could turn that around so quickly? I found Sandler's character inconsistent. One second he's a spastic moron, the next he's a relatively decent, sensitive guy, and there's no real reason to believe they're the same person. I found the humor lame--jokes revolve around ugly homosexuals finding Billy attractive and little kids pissing on themselves.  None of this will matter to the Sandler fan, but those on the fence might take note.  Some positives include two of the supporting cast--Norm McDonald (who needs to work more) and Chris Farley's brief appearance (who is missed). Also, the teacher/love-interest *is* really hot.  Sandler Fans: 4 Stars.  Everyone Else: 2 Stars 
 and put it in the cabinet.  If I get 3 more, I'll make them a coaster set.  I have been a John Hiatt fan for years, and this just doesn't measure up to his usual high standards.  I found it to be a pretty boring listen 
 From the folks who brought you the truth about the "liberal media" comes an uncredentialed academic's rant about the "liberal" turn sociology allegedly took in "the sixties." First of all, she would do well to read Thomas Frank's "The Conquest of Cool" about the rather lucrative conservative myth about "the Sixties." Secondly, it's hilarious to see a right-wing conservative who must have gone to graduate school still grasping to portray objectivity while hiding behind "academic" language to criticize behaviors she deems immoral--the hilarious collapse of pedophilia and homosexuality, for example, which seems not to notice there is a difference between consensual and non-consensual behavior, is a case in point. There seems not to be much difference in the intellectual nuance exhibited by a conservative rep like Santorum and a right-wing academic, no wonder she ended up at UC-SD. All in all, this book is the kind of politicized, conservative trash that ends up at a publisher like Encounter, all she needs to do now is to water down the language and take it to Regnery. Maybe then at least it'll sell something 
 I had to read this in school as a kid. The actual writing talent here is great but the subject matter is really depressing. I think a good story should have a nice balance of good/bad events. Steinbeck has none of that in this book. The Red Pony is just one dark cloud of doom throghout the entire book. Things go from bad to worse as the little boy's dreams are shattered. Some parts of it are also needlessly gross and bloody and I must admit that as a kid I was a little emotionally scarred from it! The book goes ubruptly to a totally different and unrelated story. As an adult I know it's meant to serve as some sort of metaphor but I still don't like this book and think it's a pointless read unless you want to be depressed or have a thing for tragic stories. I know it's supposed to be a classic, the problem is I don't know WHY! Some readers say "this is a great book for readers of all ages" but I would have to disagree! I don't think this is a kids book. I don't think kids should be forced to read this at school and I don't think I would ever read it again. 
 A friend of ours, Guy Gilbert, recommended this film as the "funniest I have ever seen"... it wasn't. There are good moments but not many. My suggestion to Guy was to watch 'Sean of the Dead' and come back to me.. 
 I was in the middle of my second day of a long awaited trip to Budapest when this card died. I was using my new Canon Rebel XT, which had no problems with my 1 GB cards throughout my 17 day trip. I lost an entire day of photos. I would not recommend this product to anyone 
 I'm sorry but the guy below me doesn't know music if he was slapped with a Gang starr cd. This mess is ridiculous. I wouldn't even want to hear this garbage in the klub let alone banging in my car. They are the modern day version of Young mc....here today gone tomorrow 
 Although the book had a few cute annocdotes, there were too few (despite repeated references) to stretch it to fill a book (even this short one).  
 The authors have made a great effort writing this book, which is divided up in two parts: macro- and microeconomics. It gives insight of how we should understand current economic affairs on both the macronomical and micronomical levels. The book does serve this purpose quite well. I particularly liked the summary at the end of each chapter. The book does however lack in solid economic theory, which makes this book inconsistent. If you are an economics student I would not recommend it for you to actually study economics (there are better books around for that), but merely as a reference to understand that theory is what you learn at univerity, and understanding the theory in practice comes usually afterwards. The big lack of this book is that it is only based from an American point of view and thus is not very useful for anyone living outside the US. Even the international economics chapter won't satisfy your desire to really understand what's is actually going on (when you don't live in the US). What this book totally fails to point out is that the US economy is very different to most other economies in the world. On the whole two stars were awarded for this book, as I think that it is very useful to  help your understand the current economic affairs. At the same time it fails in providing solid economic theory, it is based far too much on the US economy, and it is incomplete on other parts. Yet, if you live in the US, are studying economics and want to understand what it all means in practice, this book will help you! If not, don't bother 
 This book flows along nicely but never actually goes anywhere. The book simply ends with no action, and no questions answered. It left me very very annoyed 
 It is not often that I cannot finish a novel once I start it, and initially I found the world of the fringe-town psychic Alison Hart to be quite fascinating. Despite the squalor of her background and setting, Alison appears to have genuine gifts, together with a canny sense of what her public wants, and her relationship with her assistant, the much better-educated Colette, is portrayed with a good deal of sensitivity. There are also moments of welcome humor, quite wickedly so in the chapter surrounding the death of Princess Di.  But after reading to well beyond the half-way point, I realized that there was nothing to make me continue; I see from other reviews that I am not alone in this. The book lacks narrative thrust -- or rather its development depends too much on the various ghost characters that invade Alison's space. And here I think Mantel fails by treating these low-lifes in largely comic terms (Morris, her spirit guide, for example, is described as a "circus clown"), lower-class English types which seem to belong more to popular TV than to life. There are hints of trauma and abuse in Alison's childhood, and clearly the ghosts will turn out to have been connected to it. But I find it impossible to take such one-dimensional cartoons seriously as a way into the psyche of a character who has been established so clearly in the full three dimensions -- or even in four 
 Se voce esta procurando um livro que ensine como montar um "gaiola" ou "dune bug", esqueca este livro. Ele fala muito sobre motor, freio, etc. Sobre a estrutura, ou "frame", so da algumas dicas de como procurar para comprar. Ridiculo ne  
 Sorry, people. Look elsewhere for your "bible", your "holy grail", your whatever to see you through all the techno-babble. I found this hoping for a way to delineate plasma/LCD/DLP HDTVs. But the well's dry, folks. Out of print is out of luck.  By the way, why does everyone refer to all these copywriting books as "the Bible" of writing?? 
 I have read all of cussler's books.  His books start with an historical incident or "hook".He starts with a good prologue in this book and then seems to forget about it until the end of the book...Terrorists and high tech carry the story along, but seemed to bog down the easy reading and continuity of the plot..Go back to the earlier Dirk Pitt novels and enjoy them again..they are much better written and what i have enjoyed in cusslers novels 
 The book's title is, "The End."  Let's hope that it is just that...the last of a sorry attempt of portrayal to nowhere.  We don't need anymore of this crap shoved on us via a misleading cover photo on a dust jacket solely designed to sell a bad product.  Most amazon.com people probably did purchase this book because of the nude surfer chick on the front cover.  This is as good as it gets.   From the intro double-truck pic of a rear shot of 4 completely nude males, it becomes apparent that photographer Dweck has a jones for males.  Lotsa males...128 at first count throughout this large coffee table size book.  Had other reviewers pointed this out, I would not have wasted my $12 on a used copy of this $60 book.  Why photog Dweck has several one-page deals of a close-up of a rear of a male's head is anyone's guess.  Is he also a barber?  Or is it just a rear head fetish?  Or does Dweck just simply not know what to do with a camera?  As far as one reviewer stating "Naturally beautiful women so gorgeous my teeth hurt", where has this person been?  Hiding in a cave?  Locked up in a basement?  Yes, some of the chicks look ok, some are down-right hot, but I see them everyday.  Readers will tire of watching lower to lower-middle class males, some festooned with tatoos as visual crutches for identity, as markers for self-esteem to nowhere.  Nor did the one or two shots of drunken derelicts still desperately clinging to the cup that did them in make an impression.  I know, this is supposed to be artsy, but don't you outgrow this after art school?  And I don't think photog Dweck has been to arts school.  Now, if you want a craggy, dried up leather face that appears to have baked in a 120-degree desert for 100 years?  Drink-up, but don't waste good paper and print on someone else's ill-begotten lifestyle.  People bought this book sight-unseen in the anticipation of seeing others having fun, not on a slow ticket to suicide.  The photog appears to be an amateur and is grappling with what to do with a camera.  From the wasted color shot (the only color shot in the entire book) of a double-truck of a blue sky with some clouds to an entire page devoted to a plastic shark.....what is the point?  And then there is this chick riding her bicycle in another double truck scene, meandering to nowhere faithfully staying in the photog's viewfinder with an expression of "When is this going to end?"  Please read the other reviews as I have done.  Where are they coming from?  You might ask are they reviewing the same book as I have?  What in the hell is going on? 
 My son LOVES airplanes and jets! I bought this DVD based on the rave reviews of people with young children loving this video. If you want a DVD that shows airplanes/jets flying, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD! The name of the video should be, "Watch the Blue Angles Get Ready to Fly," because that is what this video is. In the first 20 minutes there are short scenes of the jets flying. Then the next 25 minutes is NO FLYING just talking and showing the Blue Angles getting ready for their show. In the last 8 minutes you get to see part of an air show. My son has never made it to that point. He wants to see airplanes/jets fly and I'm now on a new search for a DVD that will do this for him 
 Poorly researched and badly organized, this book is a huge disappointment.  One of the most superficial works on this subject that I've read.  Jackson seems to be resting on past successes and offers little new or fresh in  this failed effort 
 Nope, it is not funny. Some people might not consider me qualified to review this, as I did not even finish watching it, but personally, I was highly offended. Madea is nothing more than violent and abusive. End of story. Once she got out the belt and started beating her foster child, I had to turn it off, as I was highly disturbed. Who promotes this as being funny? That is a sad situation which unfortunately happens to lots of kids, and as a teacher and former camp counselor, I have unfortunately had direct contact with many children who have been abused in a similar way. I am sure anyone who has had direct experience with victims of abuse would agree with me that it is never funny to promote any form of domestic abuse. And all the other scenes were extremely boring. Do not watch this movie, unless you think abuse is funny, and then you are just sick 
 I recently bought the Gaiam 4mm Eco Conscious Rubber Yoga mat because i want to practice my yoga on a environmentally friendly high quality mat.  After receiving this mat, i am EXTREMELY disappointed.  I feel cheated.  They claim that it is 4mm, but i measured it to be 2mm between the bumps and maximum 3mm on the bumps.  The mat is very flimsy,stretchy and slippery.  After 1 use it looks like it is rubbing apart.  Gaiam claims that it is a natural rubber mat, but it sure does not feel like a natural rubber mat.  I have used a natural rubber mat at my studio, but it is completly different that this mat.  Even my instructor questions whether this is actually a natural rubber mat, since it feels so different than the high quality natural rubber mat at the studio.  If i wanted a cheap mat, I would have just bought one of the low quality PVC mats.  I should have spent the extra $5-$10 and bought a mat from a company that is know for their quality.  Dont make the same mistake i made 
 The author - not the subject.  Just a very strange book that requires a real will to finish 
 The first X-Men movie was fantastic. The second movie sent chills down my spine and was even better. This third movie was absolute trash and I will never buy it 
 This is one of our favorite movies.....but, when we sat down to enjoy it, the last 2 scene segments would not play.  Very unsettling 
 I was subjected to this book as a requirment for an Engineering Management masters degree course. I've seen a lot of textbooks in 7 years of college, but this one has got to be the most frustrating!  There are MANY typos, not  just mispellings - but problems done incorrectly. Also, many of the  chapters are taken from other text, so there's not a good flow to the book.   You'll probably only buy this book as a requirement for a class, but  beware!! 
 WOW. Who could escape this first point: to title your book as such takes either incredible chutzpah or unfathomable greed..I'm going to cast my vote for the latter. Depression controlled by positive thinking is like wishing really, really hard for the winning lottery number, and getting it. An even more questionable tactic is the fact that "Arline" is advertising her book in reviews for other published works such as "Fiber35". Do us all a favor and and sell your callousness elsewhere 
 I gained a brand new respect for the jockey profession after reading Bailey's book.  They are superb athletes and deserve every bit of the money they earn.  That being said, I also lost a lot of respect for the horse racing industry after reading this and another top jockey's biography.  The use/abuse of the thoroughbred & quarter horses as a means to an end to line the human pocketbook with riches is really undefendable.  The book makes clear that these amazing equine athletes are given the very best of care right up until they drop dead on the track from ruptured lungs or shattered cannon bones.  Sorry, my concience was pricked & my heart broken in the course of reading this and Gary Steven's biography, and not for the owners, trainers, handicappers, or even so much the jockeys, but for the horses.  You will also get your eyes opened as to how self-serving these people are and how ruthlessly they behave toward one another. If this is the "Sport of Kings" I'm glad to be a commoner 
 Alas, this had no discernable effect on my cats.  However, the product arrived in good time and in good shape 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 not helpful as I thought. it is so technical, I am an artist, no a paint solution maker 
 When I first saw the trailers for this film, I figured it would be a comedy and it did actually seem funny.  However, when I finally saw this movie, my first impression was that it could not be further from the truth.  It started out, somewhat, as a comedy then quickly turned into a drama which, unfortunately, doesn't work for Robin Williams.  The movie starts out slow and remains that way for about the first thirty minutes, then the suspense part kicks in and starts keeping you a little on edge throughout the rest of the movie. Suspense in a supposed comedy movie?   Man of the Year is a great example of bad and misleading marketing, because everything from the poster, to the trailer, to the online advertisements makes this movie look and feel like a comedy. I would honestly have to say about 1/3 of the film is funny while the rest of it plays off as a political thriller that makes good arguments and allows its audience to think.  
 I must admit that I finished only 2/3 of this book, I just could not bear anymore, even as entertainment.  It was that bad.  But, from what I read, I advise that the plot is pointless and unrealistically laid down.  The characters, especially the main character and her love interest, are very poorly developed.  What is developed of the main character is unlikeable.  The book has the tone of someone who is talking (i.e. writing), not because she has something to say (she doesn't), but because she likes the sound of her own voice.  Wolitzer does know how to string words together well, but there is nothing upon which to hang those words, which is insulting to the reader. I knew before I read the book jacket that Wolitzer much teach creative writing.  It is obvious from the content of the book that she considers herself a literary giant and thinks that impressive. She should stick with that, her "novel" is beyond disappointing.  I'm sorry but the comparison to Wolitzer to Anne Tyler is laughable. 
 First the sound quality is poor - I had my stereo turned almost up to max and it was just loud enuf to hear.  Then there are the uncredited/unlisted "bonus tracks" - they are comercials/radio ads for Ike & Tina.  The version of "River Deep, Mountain High" is not the Phil Spector version. 
 The elements of business writing give good point to look at.But the book is old and sometime give weird information.It's not an important book to have but, but still have some info 
 This book just didn't get started for me.  I'm still trying to get interested in it...and for me not to be able to keep a Marcia Muller book in my hands until I'm done is unthinkable. 
 Real horror fans of werewolves, do NOT waste your time with this piece of garbage. It is so terribly acted by the most motly bunch of wannabee actors! The monster is one of the worse I have ever seen. Check out Dog Soldiers if you want to see some good stuff. The ultimate worst movie is Blood of the Werewolf, a trilogy of sophomoric attempts to scare. 
 A very skilful writer, Alan Dershowitz has again managed to mangle much of the truth, which he liberally mixes with sheer falsehoods and reasoning so poor that one wonders why he occupies a lofty position at Harvard. Perhaps the dog has indeed caught its own tail. We have been saturated with pro-Israel biased reporting and there is incessant whinging about the Holocaust - we have, up to recently had a knee-jerk response -"Israel is good and above criticism - the Palestinians are totally bad and corrupt" Fortunately there is now sufficient well-reasoned material around so that we can get away from the gross propaganda such as the stuff delt out here. We can and will criticize anyone we want including Israel's actions. That is not anti-Semitism. So much that finds its way into the American press is just lies, defamming the Palestinians. Dershowitz's book is, at its core, racist. Holocaust survivors' families want the return of the properties that the Nazies stole from them. Understandibly. However, that right does not extend to the Palestinians - it is a uniquely a Jewish right. Steal land - do not compensate; stick illegal settlements into Palestine and steal the water - why should these stay in place? Dershowitz cannot have it both ways - If the Survivors want compensation and the return of their property (as best as is possible) the same must apply to the Palestinians. The latter has been replaced by a series of Big Lies, which Dershowitz repeats. Shame! This book is a rehash of Big Lies and is Nazi in content because of its racism and inherent classificaton of Palestinians as Untermensch. Dershowitz reiterates and promulgates a fascist, racist, position 
 This was an exasperating book to read! Barnes has tried to make the story interesting by telling the story through recordings made by a patient of a psycologist of some kind. He has invented a lot of words like "skosh", "roo", "kim" etc which is not explaned and continues to annoy the reader by his lack of ability to actually tell a story through first person.   The story can be believable at times, but pew, all these personal, non-relevant reflections only carry along an annoying feeling that the writer doesn't seem to have the nerve to write proper hard sci-fi. He seems to be hiding behind diversions, lame reflections and obviousness instead of driving the story forward.   I can hardly understand how this book can appeal to anyone looking for science fiction. On the front cover Arthur C Clarke is quoted "A master of the genre". Well, the quote doesn't specify which genre or even which author it relates to.. 
 It will give you some idea about how Wainwright is straining for material that one of this CD's songs is about 9-11. Now four years into the history books, Loudon seemingly has nothing better to say about the tragedy than he noticed white tiles in the New York subway.  There isn't a "Westchester County" to be found on this offering. "My Biggest Fan"--just to cite one example--seems pointlessly indulgent even from egotist Wainwright.  There's no "aha" in the song and Wainwright comes off as mean-spirited towards an inconsequential target that few will be able to relate to.  The CD a few years back that followed his mother's death exhibited poetry and beautiful melodies, such as "White Wine." But "Here Come the Choppers" is just a Shake-And-Bake of half-conceived songs you'll never listen two weeks after purchasing the CD.  Wainwright is a notoriously uneven artist, but "Here Comes the Choppers" is an under-inflated balloon at a party where you can't help but yawn 
 This is an anti-intellectual book for reactionaries.  The idea with these people is that their political opinions are "facts" and since they are "facts" they cannot be challenged and must be accepted as history. The agenda behind this is usually to turn history into an intellectual prop for the government and right-wing ideas. The people involved currently want to rehabilitate ideas like the crusades, the idea of "civilizing primative people" through force and the essential unchanging goodness of America. But in the end its not about history so much as it is trying to create guidelines for how history should be presented and taught.  The book also wants to bring a sort of morality into history.  All conflicts are to have a good side and an evil side.  Taking an example from american history, Vietnam was a "good" war done for the "right" reasons.  The vietnamese who opposed America and anyone who opposed the war in the US is therefore by definition "evil".  There can, in this view, never be two sides to a conflict.  There are only good people who must be helped and evil people who oppose them who must be destroyed.  There is good and evil in history, but overplaying morality as the book proposes leads only to turning history into national propaganda.  Then the author goes into the virtues of "old fashioned" ideas.  In American history, the first old fasioned idea is the civilizing mission of America on the frontier.  The book wants to go back to the days were native americans are "savages" in the way of the march of progress and civilization.  Where colonialism exists to help the inferior peoples of the world reach a higher level of civilization.  And where every history sweeps inconvenant facts under the rug to promote the goodness and virtue of the country.  Its a history of propaganda and not much more.  The far left and the far right are each just as bad as the other.  Each wants to take history and use it as a weapon to re-educate the broader society.  The lesson should take away is that history as an academic discipline can't really work when the people in the field (right or left) use it as a political weapon.  The conflicts the author sees are not conflicts about "facts" or "history" but political conflicts where there is no easy answer.  History as an academic subject can only work when the facts presented are accepted by the overwhelming majority of those being taught the history 
 John Horgan is one of those intellectually challenged journalists who only want to write about big things because they are too proud to be interested in any particular "small" question that science tries to solve. So many of these journalists choose a truly big theory - namely that there is something seriously wrong with the scientific method and with science and that science may be ending.  Of course, the scientists consider all such journalists and "thinkers" to be cranks, for a very good reason. The very existence of our civilization - something that distinguishes most of us from the monkeys - is based on certain general principles that also underlie science and these principles will never be given up unless the whole humankind is really doomed.  Careful thinking that is as quantitative as possible and the elimination of ideas that have turned out not to be viable are two examples of such principles.  John Horgan, is his attempt to earn his 15 minutes of fame - plus some bucks - has written this nasty book that not only offered a whole sequence of possible theories how science can finally be killed and how horrible science is. This book was also full of personal attacks against the scientists, their appearance, their voice, and all of their other superficial and unimportant characteristics.   John Horgan was - and still is - just far too dumb to be able to look into the scientists' thoughts, the entities that make the scientists important. At least, he could analyze their "quirkiness" and write confusing stories about the scientists and aliens that have nothing to do with the essence of the research done by the actual scientists.  Such crappy books have always found a lot of readers who eagerly buy them. However, the books have no lasting value. It's been almost 10 years since the book was released, and all of its predictions look even more absurd now than they looked 10 years ago. The science hasn't ended, Edward Witten is still the most respected physicist, and John Horgan is still just a despicable nobody.  Also, this book is the 360,000th most successful book at amazon.com; compare with The Elegant Universe that has been among the top 1,000 books more or less for the whole time. Nevertheless, the big doomsayers and science-haters will never close their mouth. So they still flood the book market with many new crappy books that are very similar to Horgan's book - Troubles with Physics, Not Even Wrong, and various feminist diatribes against the male science - books that will surely share the fate of this nonsense written by Horgan. But before the time will speak, thousands of new stupid consumers will buy these books and they will say how terribly inspiring the content is 
 Hmm I wonder if those giving this book five stars actually work for McKinsey.  As a practioner, I don't know anyone in the industry who has actually read this book.  It looks impressive on the bookshelf, but the content is anything but impressive.  A lot of topics are covered, but each one only superficially and the writing is extremely dry and boring.  I actually found reading this volume *painful*, and I'm supposed to like this stuff since I do it for a living!  My advice for any potential buyer is read a few chapters first before you shell out for it 
 This book is written by Hellen Keller, a blind and deaf woman, telling about her childhood and growing up. The book is filled with anecdotes. Each one is about a page or two long and has no connection with the one before it or the following one. The date can vary from year to year without much warning. I would not recommend this book to young readers. I am 14 and became quite confused at times. I had to read this book for school. There were some very nice points in the book, though. If you are a Hellen Keller fan, I would highly recommend this book. It is full of many things in her life that you would not know if you only read a biography or just watched one of the movies made of her life 
 Lisey's Story is the newest in a series of boring books by Stephen King. Very sad considering Mr. King used to be one of my favorite authors. I hate to say this, but it seems since Mr. King got hit by that van, his writing has gone downhill. Liseys's Story got alot of good reviews and I thought maybe the old, page turning Stephen King was back. Not so. I was lucky to get through about 50 pages of this book and called it quits. I was being put to sleep. 
 This is a piece of junk.  Spring broke, constantly resets itself and after less than a month it completely gave out.  Don't waste your money 
 What's wrong with this show?  1.  Jim wears the same pants, coat, and shirt for almost every episode throughout the entire run of the series.       2.  A slow, sluggish middle-aged man is supposed to outdo younger hoodlums.    3.  Won't that woman lawyer ever get a real boyfriend that will do right by her?  4.  Do you really believe that this middle-aged, heavy fellow would drive a Firebird - a tight fitting car?  5.  Angel!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 In 1709, thousands of Germans fled the hard times of Southwestern Germany and made their way down the Rhine to Rotterdam, where they were transported to London.  There Queen Anne took pity on them and eventually provided transportation to New York, arriving in the winter of 1710/11, where they were supposed to work in a naval stores business making pine tar and pitch for use in British ships.  They settled in the upper Hudson River Valley in East Camp and West Camp in Columbia and Ulster Counties, NY.  Although some Germans have apparently been in North American from the very beginning, this was the first large scale migration of Germans to the New World (about 3000 people in 11 ships).  Most with German names whose ancestry traces to 18th century New York prove to be part of this great Palatine migration.  Otterness is the third recounting of the Palatines' story.  Others include Walter Alan Knittle, "The Early Eighteenth Century Palatine Emigration:  A British Government Redemptioners Project to Manufacture Naval Stores," Genealogical Publishing Co., Baltimore, MD, 1937, 1965 and Sanford H. Cobb, "The Story of the Palatines:  An Episode in Colonial History," GP Putnam's Sons, NY, 1897.  Reprinted by Heritage Books, Bowie, MD, 1988.  Cobb is the original focusing on the stories told by the Palatines themselves.  Knittle is the more professional treatment which compares the stories with the written records.  Otterness now adds the extensive genealogical information obtained by Henry Z. Jones in the preparation of his three books (The Palatine Families of New York, 1985; More Palatine Families, 1991; and Even More Palatine Families, 2002).  Jones researched the old church books of Germany where he was able to identify records of hundreds of Palatines who made the voyage to New York.  Hence, Otterness is able to expand the story to include information on the distribution of the Germans.  The naval stores business soon failed.  The Germans felt mistreated and wanted the better lands in the Schoharie Valley, they felt they had been promised.  But they were held by contract to the Queen to work in the naval stores business in return for their transportation.  After the failure of the business, they faced starvation once rations were cut off.  Some scattered to New York City, to New Jersey, and to work for nearby farmers, but many settled in the Schoharie against the advice of Gov. Hunter.  There they were unable to get clear title to their lands due to conflicting claims.  Eventually some had to buy the land they had already cleared.  Others scattered.  This time some settled in Pennsylvania in Tupplehocken, in what later became the center of the Pennsylvania Dutch.  Others settled in the Mohawk Valley, where they did very well, but they encountered Indian attacks.  Otterness retells the famous story from the Schoharie.  In those sexist times, women were thought less responsible for their crimes due to their emotional state.  Hence, they were not punished as severely when convicted.  After repeated efforts to evict the squatters, the sheriff from Albany arrived to arrest leader Johann Weiser.  The women of the settlement attacked him with their brooms.  He was tied to a rail, dragged through the mud, and carried four miles to be tossed off a bridge.  Then he was attacked with stakes breaking several ribs and poking out an eye.  The women pissed in his face. He survived and made his way home, but his pride was damaged.  This is typical of the mischief the Germans carried out to express their displeasure with broken promises and their circumstances.  Otterness covers the story in concise professional language, but seemingly only the parts of the story he personally has researched.  This is not the comprehensive presentation it could have been.  His language is almost terse.  Numerous details are omitted.  He does not explain his reasons for revisions from what was previously published.  Hence, previously, Rev. Kocherthal, the Lutheran minister who accompanied the Palatines is identified as the leader of the group.  Otterness hardly mentions Kocherthal.  Instead he notes that Johann Friederich Haeger was the German Reformed minister who accompanied the largely protestant, mixed Lutheran and Reformed group.  The Palatines were attracted by tracts, especially the "Golden Book" that circulated in the area advising that Queen Anne was offering free transportation and free land to settlers in the New World.  Those claims were made more credible by reports of an earlier group of 43 pioneers led by Rev. Kocherthal to Newburg, NY, in 1708.  They were given 40 acres of land, tools, and provisions until they could produce their own, plus a glebe (landgrant) to support a pastor.  Otterness does not fully tell the story of this group.  (The Germans found the soil inferior and relocated to Pennsylvania, after which their church and glebe became Anglican.)  He references Knittle.  Otterness discounts the claim that the Palatines were refugees fleeing the repeated destruction of religious wars exacerbated by an especially cold, damaging winter.  Instead, he feels this was window dressing applied to gain support for relocation funding in Parliament by Daniel Defoe, who was a Whig politician.  Instead the Palatines were poor, who came looking for the better life promised in the Golden book.  The book does include details of the naval stores business and how those products were made.  He completely omits earlier reports that the pine trees of New York are not of the correct species to make naval stores.  Only Southern pines have been processed successfully.  He includes better details of Tuplehocken in Pennsylvania, and relates part of the story of Ephrata, a religious commune that formed around a charismatic leader nearby.  Apparently some Palatines were members of Ephrata.  He does not tell the story of the collapse of Ephrata.  (A costly bell was purchased for the bell tower without the approval of the membership causing many to leave the commune.)  He includes several nicely done maps that clarify where settlements were, but he provides little information on the Palatine colonies of New Jersey.  Others have said that the poor treatment the Palatines received in New York contrasted sharply with their acceptance by the peace loving Quakers of Pennsylvania.  Hence, after 1720, most Germans preferred to settle in Pennsylvania-building the Pennsylvania Dutch tradition.  Some have said Germans would not even step foot off a ship in New York City on their way to Philadelphia.  Otterness completely omits this aspect of the story.  Otterness manages to project the "stubborn German" stereotype for the Palatines.  They could be very unco-operative, and stubbornly stuck to their goals-good farm land-in spite of numerous adversities.     This is a useful addition to the body of knowledge of the Palatines.  It is not comprehensive.  Students will want to review all three books for details.  Extensive references and end notes.  Index (though somewhat meager).  Maps.  Illustrations 
 won't ship to hawaii. hawaii is a state in the united states.  some seem to think it is a forign country. damn fools! 
 To listen to an obviously unhappy man about how to be happy 
 Ugh! The writing in this book was so bad! It was so hokey, like a bad soap opera with a religious bent. The storylines were so transparent, everyone of them ended up exactly where I suspected they were going. I love faith promoting books and writings; I just couldn't get past the corniness and predictability of this book to feel the spirit and message the authors intended 
 his idea was great for the book, alot of the stuff he says was well researched and correct, however, alot , especially when it gets to psychology , was outdated, and incorrect, and the book has alot of contradictions, once again, especially with the psychology parts, and his imprinting and mal-imprinting section contradicts things he says later on in the book, if you want to be better informed, skip this and go straight to actual psychology books , this is more or less a book for people who want to pretend to be intellectual, and just take anyones word on anything 
 This "book" should be in the "complete idiots guide to..." series. Recommended for the clueless beginners 
 Back in the early 90's, Jane March made a big splash internationally with her uninhibited performance in the sexually explicit The Lover. Granted, the role didn't give her much to work with, but from a physical standpoint she made a big impression on a lot of filmgoers, including me. The movie garnered her a lot of notoriety and she had every opportunity to use that as a spring-board into a legitimate movie career. Unfortunately, choosing the unbelievably stupid Bruce Willis vehicle Color of Night as her follow-up probably killed any chance at a career that she had.   I've always found erotic thrillers to be quite a dubious genre. Most of the ones that I've seen, while sexually explicit, aren't really erotic. Nor are they thrilling in any way. This movie was following on the heals of the tremendous success of Basic Instinct and almost every studio was chomping at the bit to come out with something similar. As a result we ended up with some terrible films like Sliver, Jade, Body of Evidence and this film, Color of Night.   The plot goes something like this. Bruce Willis is a psychiatrist who has a patient dive out of his office window, going splat on the sidewalk below. He is so traumatized by the incident that he loses the ability to see the color red(!). He decides to take a break by visiting his psychiatrist friend played by Scott Bakula and hanging out with Scott's therapy group. He hopes that he might be able to make some sense as to what has happened. Scott's group is a motley crew of screwed up people, from a woman who is nymphomaniac, to a weird androgynous young boy. Bruce ends up meeting a beautiful young woman played by the delectable Jane March and he quickly falls in love with her. We get treated to explicit scenes of the two of them screwing in the pool, the bedroom, the bathtub and the shower. Meanwhile someone murders Scott Bakula and starts to wreck havoc with Bruce. He tries to figure out if it's someone in Scott's therapy group and on and on and so forth.   The movie is really quite laughable due to the fact of how serious Bruce Willis was apparently taking this movie. Virtually everyone else in the movie seems to have their tongue planted in their cheeks with their performances, but Bruce seemed to think that this might be an Oscar contender. Add to the fact that the plot is absolutely atrocious and contrived beyond comprehension, and add way too many red herrings, and the movie quickly becomes a chore to watch.   About the only thing this movie really had going for it was the explicit, but decidedly unerotic sex scenes. They really come across as more silly than anything else.   The only thing that I enjoyed was getting to see a slightly older Jane March in the buff and looking better than ever. What a smoking body!  But, like I mentioned before, she got a lot of the blame along with Bruce as to why the movie turned out so terrible and as a result, she has appeared in very few movies since. I still think that if she had been given the proper chance, she could have been a great actress, but people have all but forgotten about her by now.   It's really surprising that this movie didn't kill Bruce Willis' career. But I guess if he could survive Hudson Hawk & Bonfire of the Vanities, he could survive anything.   BTW, the version I watched was listed as being the "R-rated director's cut" with 17 additional "steamy" minutes added back into the film. Since I never saw the original cut I couldn't tell what might have been added back into this version. There is some fairly explicit sexual content and a shot of full frontal Bruce Willis nudity in the pool scene but nothing that's too strong.  Avoid this movie like it was herpes.   Color of Night is rated R and contains strong sexual content, nudity, graphic violence and strong language. 
 This case didn't justify my expectations because first of all it looks cheap and built cheap (when you close it frames look a little asymmetric). My case is black so if you drop it by occasion it will have scratches. Another thing that I didn't like at all is that you can't use your cradle while your Dell is in the case. Also it doesn't work in my car's mount. It means that you have to pull your Dell out all the time (when you do it too often, fastenings on the case loosen). I wouldn't buy one like this anymore for this price. If it cost me $5, I would think.. 
 The pants are not Juniors', they are Women's pants that go up past your waistline when you wear them 
 "I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and dog-gone-it, people like me." That seems to encapsulate Ms. Vanzant's approach to spirituality.  I don't know about anybody else, but when I look inside myself, I see that despite my best intentions and genuine desire to be "good," I often act in ways that trouble my own conscience. Ms. Vanzant's assertion that this stems from the fact that I have not yet really embraced my God-ness leaves me troubled, empty, and confused.   The fact is that it doesn't really matter if one's soul "opens up."  The question is what is one's soul opened up to?  If you are looking for a book that will tell you what you want to hear about spirituality (that you are a god, that there's nothing essentially wrong with humanity, that evil comes only from lack of enlightenment, that everything that you need to be fulfilled is already inside of you, etc.), then this is the book for you.  But if you're looking for a book that deals  realistically with the problem of evil, with human nature, and with what it means to grapple with both a human and a spiritual  nature, then don't give this book a second look.  I believe Ms. Vanzant's book is an insult to the reality, the severity, and the complexity of the human condition 
 We're deep into the formula now with computer animated films -- and Over The Hedge is one of the most tired of the bunch. Can anyone say Buzz and Woody? Chicken Run? The Exterminator is the stock villain in CGI movies --almost identical to the vintage toy collector in Toy Story 2. How many times can you do the A-bomb joke...  Worse still is the dialogue, the painfully unfunny one-liners, and the  see-saw animation that is either dull or like a pinball machine with sight gags and explosions. It is clear that each of these animators are trying to outdo one another, and that once again we see a cleverly-disguised lack of locations -- or interest. There must be nothing easier to craft and render than endless rows of geometric homes and a single proscenium of forest. This film is a by-the-numbers piece of merchandising with very little genuine artistry. 
 Houghton eschews all talk of money in his book, but these days, a producer's priority is getting funding for his film.  Of course, it was easy for him to disregard financial matters -- he was primarily a TV producer, with a big studio backing his moves.  Beyond the Twilight Zone, his credits were immaterial.  Hence, his advice is largely inapplicable to independent producers and students of film -- the likely readers of this book.  This book is also dry to the point of going full-Sahara.  As just one example, he describes a sound-editing room in tedious detail for no apparent reason.  When you consider the fact that today's sound-editing rooms bear no resemblance to the rooms Houghton used on the Twilight Zone, then it's all just wasted ink.  And as if this book wasn't enough of a chore to read, it contains numerous typos.  Pathetic.  If you want to get an inside-look at making movies, you would be better served by renting your favorite DVD's and listening to the commentaries.  Then supplement that by reading John J. Lee's reference book, "The Producer's Business Handbook. 
 I cannot believe this book was written by a woman.  Each page is insult after insult.  This author greatly offends me.  I am a stay at home mother and wife. But I am in no mean subservient to my husband, or any man. I am glad this woman could speak her mind and ramble with insanity.  But she is stuck in an era that has long since past.  She needs to get over it and move on. If this is what a "conservative" women sounds like, I just turned liberal real quick 
 Do not waste money on this book. I bought this book and returned it after  reading the recipes. They are inaccurate and the author does not change the  bittering on his different versions of each recipe(the bittering should be  lowered on an all grain batch). In one of the barleywine recipes he has you  mashing 18lbs. of grain in 2.5lbs. of water-impossible.The list of errors  go on and on. The publisher dropped the ball when they did not get the  Szamatulski's(originator of Clone Brews) to write this book. I can not wait  for the next Szamtulski book to come out-the real sequel! 
    It is difficult to identify with such unusual heroes as a cannibal and a self multilator even if the author throws the two of them redemptive acts in the final pages of the book.       The bizarre cast of characters does not live up to the stage it performs on.    I expected much more when the book was compared on the cover to Dr. Zhivago and Anna Karenina.....PLEASE.... 
 Some say the arguments against Afrocentrism formally opened with the publication of Dinesh D'Souza's Illiberal Education in 1991. Now a professor at Stanford, D'Souza was a young conservative journalist at the American Enterprise Institute, a D.C. located public-policy right-wing self-proclaimed "think-tank". No wonder D'Souza spends a chapter of the text ("In Search of Black Pharaohs: The Roots of Protest at Howard")  having the gall to seethe at the intellectual activities of Howard University, the breeding ground for Eric Williams' Capitalism and Slavery among other brilliant publications. D'Souza complains that the modern American university, in the name of diversity and multiculturalism, has stifled debate and intimidated larger society into accepting new canons. These canons are essentially race and gender-based propositions that one must accept or risk being ostracized as sexist or racist.  Illiberal Education opens by describing the ideal university campus: a place that is "serene and opulent", with students "[moving] in small groups", Ivy Leagues "[giving] off a distinct aroma of old money and tradition."  He then launches into a criticism of campus protest, trivializing the University of Michigan race-scandals of the early 1990's, whittling the whole episode down to [...] and blacks demanding the chance to make punching bags out of inoffensive white male students. He pours sympathy on poor Robert Gallagher, a Princeton University professor who opposed Women's Studies in the 1980's. D'Souza argues that Western thought has historically been self-criticising (i.e. Marxism is a criticism of Western bourgeois culture that sprung specifically from Western bourgeois culture) and that the teaching method of the typical liberal curricula pre-Afrocentrism and gender-focused studies was disputation, not indoctrination.  Forgetting that racism and sexism are still weighty social realities for many Americans and that all Americans are victims of both sexism and racism, Illiberal Education concludes that recent gender and ethnic studies programs are unfortunately based on unnecessary indoctrinationist principles. The book does not analyse anything written at the Howard University Press closely. D'Souza argues vehemently against affirmative action programs, multiculturalism, left-wing academia in all its packages, and `political correctness'. Excerpts from his book have appeared in stories in New Republic and Forbes Magazine. Also, more than two dozen major newspapers and magazines have reviewed Illiberal Education. In promoting his publication, Dinesh D'Souza spoke at numerous colleges and universities, followed by a 20-city media tour and appearances on such network talk and news shows as Good Morning America and Nightline. Instead of bemoaning separatist activities of Afrocentric groups, D'Souza asks, in the front flap of his book Letters To A Young Conservative, "Are you tired of the liberal agenda that dominates so many aspects of American life?" without recognising that America is largely a puritan state. His book What's So Great About America has a chapter called "Two Cheers for Colonialism" and another called "The Reparations Fallacy: What African-Americans Owe America." He idolises Ronald Reagan, the man who opposed both the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Housing Act of 1970 and called the Voting Rights Act of 1965 "humiliating to the South".  Nonsense!! 
 Virtually all the ideas in this book are already practiced by most successful company's - they just describe them differently. There is nothing new. My other problem is how the author uses the book to promote a personal agenda. And talk about ego - his family, friends, and other business initiatives are promoted in the book. And most of the pictures have nothing to do with the title of the book or how it is positioned. If it's going to be an autobiography, TELL US SO. I should have known something was up when most of the reviewers were either politicians, friends or other people that have never ran successful businesses.   And speaking of business success, a share of stock in Jan 1994 (around the time Mr. Bakke became CEO) was trading at an adjusted $5 per share. Seven years later in December of 2002 (the year Mr. Bakke retired), the share price was $3.02. No thanks - I'll put my money in GE. Need I say more.   Look, I'm sure this guy is a great person and he is obviously super smart but I do not think this is a credible book. 
 This is a first draft book. Good ideas, poor execution, and totally failed by the editor to make it cohesive.  Our hero Christian, is the vampire who was the secondary character of the first book in the series. In that he was portrayed as a little crazy, pretty effeminate, and frankly unattractive.  But in this book he's magically tall, dark and Alpha. The heroine from the first book, ostensibly his "soul mate" married to another man, and her best friend have teamed up to find his "real" soul mate. It is never fully explained how he can have two.  But he does, and the second is named is Allie, another America in Europe. Allie is a summoner. She raises ghosts for a living, and has done so for 7 years despite never having raised a ghost before page 50. The author would have us believe in this universe ghosts are as debated as they are in ours but once Allie raises one she raises many and there is concrete proof of their existence. It's never explained why they are not believed in when they can be shown on film and are regularly.  Allie must aid Christian to find another Dark One, held captive by her evil boss who now wishes to possess Allie for...well, I'll be damned. Never did explain why. Inevitably she defeats her boss by discovering the hidden power in herself, made stronger by her bond with Christain.  The romantic tension is pretty good, even if the author uses ever romance cliché in the book (previous abusive husband, virginal attitude towards sex yet she gets real freaky real fast, and Christian is so self assured you want to smack him at certain points). The sex is surprisingly *yawn* boring and repetitive, very uninspired.  I bought it used for $3.95 and I wouldn't have paid any more for it. I wouldn't read the first (A Girl's Guide to Vampires - the ULTIMATE misnomer) at all, and this one only if you're REALLY bored and want a vamp book.  PS- she also shamelessly uses this book to set the stage for her Aisling Grey series. Thanks to the writing in this one I'll never bother with those books, and neither should you. 
 I love The Foundations who made a lot of great music in the sixties. Of course everyone has heard "Baby Now That I've Found You" and "Build Me Up Buttercup", but they had so many great songs. I had a ten inch compilation from the early'80's with about ten songs, all of which are on this disc. They would've fit in very well with a lot of the Motown groups, although they were a multi-racial English band. I mistakenly gave this recording one star when I intended five. 
 I read about this book on Jorn Barger's website, in the section in which he recommends books. This book is on a par with Conrad and Hemingway. Intensity of mood meshes with character development and descriptions of people, actions, places, weather on a particular day, crowds in different countries, literary allusions. There are a few pages on which a little jargon is used: most English-speakers who grew up in an English-speaking country and don't live in a cave will "get" them. A few were even over my head, and I'm not only a native English speaker but a native Californian, who grew up in the 70s drug culture, so I should get all of them (there are about three or four things I didn't understand). But even if you don't know what place June is referring to when she says "P.V" (it's Puerto Vallarta), these few phrases shouldn't detract from your enjoyment of one of the greatest American novels. IMnotatallHO, this book beats anything I have read by David Foster Wallace, T. Coraghessan Boyle, Don DeLillo, or anyone in the McSweeney's crowd.   DON'T TAKE HEED OF ANY REVIEWS OF THIS BOOK WRITTEN BY DISGRUNTLED IOWAN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO HAD TO WRITE A REVIEW OF IT FOR A CLASS.   [Oh yeah: why I gave it one star: I like to give my reviews one star, because then discerning people will read them. I myself usually avoid reading five-star reviews as they are almost always mindless gushing - give me some juicy, bitchy opinionated ranting over simpering tepid praise any day!  On the Dveej-o-meter, Dog Soldiers gets a 9.6 out of 10. 
 "Children of the Corn" had some potential: a "corn" cult for children with a charismatic adolescent as its leader takes over a rural town in Nebraska. Based on a short story by Stephen King, this is a fairly interesting and unusual concept. Unfortunately, some very weak execution is what mars the movie. Its director, Fritz Kiersch, sometimes works as "Alan Smithee," the pseudonym for directors who don't want to attach their real names to movies they know are turkeys. This movie doesn't quite warrant that, though it isn't very good either. There is scarcely anything more pathetic than a movie that claims to be frightening, yet simply is not. Most egregious is the use of hokey, faux sacred music. Aside from Linda Hamilton, John Franklin and Robbie Kiger, the performances are pretty weak. It doesn't help that some of the dialogue is laughably bad and that some of the special effects are cheap and look awful. Isaac Chroner (Franklin) instructs the children of the town to murder all but one adult, who is apparently needed to warn potential visitors against entering the town. His advice nearly prevents Vicky and Burt Stanton from seeking medical help there, but darker forces prevail and the couple finds itself fending off attacks from the kids. If the excessively dramatic acting and cheesy effects at the climax do not make you laugh, the incredibly lame final scene certainly will. That is not to say this movie is all bad, however. Though never scary, there are a few effective moments throughout. (I don't want to reveal any of them because they would be the only reasons for watching the movie)  Die hard horror fans might want to check out this 1984 release, though fans of good movies will probably want to steer clear. This Anchor Bay DVD is anamorphic widescreen with good picture and sound, though this is not the director's cut. 
 There is some very helpful information in here about how a woman's cycle works. I would be very cautious, however, about the nutrition information. Here is my story:  I was ovulating every 16-18 days with a 11-day luteal phase. Hoping to ovulate closer to every 14 days and lengthen my luteal phase, I began taking the vitamin Optivite, so heavily recommended in the book. I took Optivite for four months, and in that time I would either ovulate extremely late--30+ days followed by a 9 or 10 day luteal cycle-- or NOT AT ALL.   For whatever reason, I didn't immediately connect my ovulation problems with taking the Optivite (seems so obvious now). Then I read something from another source about how excess vitamin A can inhibit ovulation. I then QUIT taking Optivite. My first cycle off of Optivite, my ovulation returned to normal-- and THAT IS WHEN I FINALLY GOT PREGNANT.  It may be that Optivite has helped other women who were really deficient in some of those vitamins. But, in my case, I guess I was healthy to begin with, and it just screwed with my body 
 When I saw this movie, I knew that all of the truth wouldn't be in the film. I just didn't know they would bend the truth that much! It was poorly researched the facts wern't straight and they over exaggerated her sex life and made her out to be a codependent woman who would sell out to any man that was "someone". I mean come on, I know she was a sex symbol of her time and wanted attention, but they took it to far. Another thing that really bothered me, was how they made it seem like she was a crazy loon, a huge junkie and a stupid person! She was not any of those things. Anyone who has ever read a book or interviews with her, would know that. So I'm telling you now, if you want to "know" about Marilyn Monroe, your better off buying a bio about her. The only good thing about this movie, is that Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino are really good actresses 
 The author's barely concealed condescention towards her Provencal neighbors is annoying enough, but her lack of any charm or distinction relaying her experiences is really a bore.  Read Peter Mayle instead --or ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER,and save your money.  You wouldn't want to live next door to this writer, in Provence or in Bel Air California -- her other home.  Not exactly your average tourist!  And oh my,the recipes!  At the end of each chapter is a recipe of food vaguely mentioned in the text.  Tasteless, trite recipes bound to fail since they lack any semblance of detail, even, sometimes, the baking temperature.  Obviously the lady was trying to cover all bases.  Too bad she struck out on all of them 
 This book should be targeted towards those who have no idea where to get started and are just tossing around ideas.  Don't be under the impression that you'll run your business with this book 
 I found this book to be terse and unfriendly. I used this text for my introduction to markov chains class and did not get much out of it. If ur looking for a review of markov chain theory then U should consider this book. If ur looking for clear in-depth explanations and problems that are relevant to the chapters material look somewhere else 
 For over ten years I've used Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book for making yeast and leavened (wild yeast) breads.  Mostly the former.  It has one recipe, however, for a whole-grain leavened bread which is more sophisticated than a rustic sourdough.  That recipe alone is worth the book's price and produces a more flavorful and healthful bread than the sourdough leavened white bread I just made using a recipe from Classic Sourdoughs.  Additionally, Classic Sourdoughs is not well edited for clarity, contains a fair amount of incidental information not relevant to learning how to bake breads, and lacks the extensive research that went into creating Laurel's Kithchen Bread Book.  Unless you cannot obtain good quality whole wheat flour or have a strong preference for white flour, Laurel's Kitchen is a much better value for your time and money 
 I started this novel after reading Erdrich's Love Medicine. While it is clearly not as lyrically written, it is more accessible, and I admired Erdrich's inventiveness as she creates a very unique set of characters. I never finished "Beet Queen", quitting not that far from the end. When Celestine's child turned out to be so impossible, it was the last straw. "Beet Queen" is just too determinedly bleak, to no higher purpose I could discern or discover in reading reviews here. 
 The second half of the book is a neverending parade of cartoon violence.  The cast begins to blur and fade together as our hero suffers one beating/shooting/injury after another but keeps on going with the help of an occasional percocet instead of three weeks in the hospital.  By the end I had lost track of who was doing what to whom and for what reason.  Improbable coincidences pile up and let the hero's pursuers track him down against all odds.  I think I read and enjoyed the author's first book but this one was like finishing a dull assignment.  It was a chore to read at the end.   
 I purchased this book and attempted to use it as a resource for a trip to Cambodia in July 1999. The only current information in the entire country section was that Pol Pot has died. Cambodia is a fascinating place to visit...Too much has changed for this book to be of any us 
 The idea was good but Natasha simply didn't have the talent to put it in written and understandable text. She switches all the time the "I", got me confused about who she was talking about, her or her aunt.She mixed both stories, suddenly she wants to explains her "great destiny" (narcissism) at the same time as she tells the strory about her great aunt. Those second, third, fourth, xth brother's wife, sister, uncles, all irritating narrative. I really tried to like the story, to pick and read and just gave me headaches trying to figure it out whose story she is talking. Go back to school. I don't know how the editor accepts this kind of book to be published, need a lot of editing. Maybe someone in the publishing house is her relative. 
 Ordered this knowing it was inexpensive but what I received was worse than expected in part because Amazon sent the wrong item. Spoke with Customer Service who sent a replacement which they promised would be inspected first; however, the same WRONG item was again sent. The problem is the item has been switched with another silver heart locket, one even cheesier than the product listed. I contacted Customer Service regarding the replacement; they recognize now the real problem and are working to correct ... eventually. Both lockets have been returned; there didn't seem to be any way of getting the proper locket. I wound-up ordering a completely different design from another vendor 
 This is the second Nevada Barr that I have read. I picked it up on the strength of Deep South, which I thought was really terrific. It was frustrating that nearly all of what I liked about Deep South was missing from Flashback.  Flashback is structured with interwoven narratives which involve both the real-life murder and a civil war mystery related to Anna Pigeon's own family. The civil war story (told through letters and dream-like sequences) is clearly intended to add a note of gothic mystery to the story. Some may like the flavor that this element provides, but for me it dilutes the elements of the writing that I most enjoy. I really liked the crisp realism of Deep South, and felt that the style put it a cut above most books in the genre. Flashback, on the other hand, felt painfully contrived. The plot line with the letters was extremely unrealistic and (to my mind) unnecessary.   If you like historical mysteries with a gothic flavor more than you like realism in a detective novel, then you will probably be significantly less bothered than I was by Flashback. Barr at least made a clear choice with her approach to the book. Judging from the reviews, not everyone had a negative reaction to the interwoven plot lines.  I will go ahead and pick up a third Barr book, because I did like Deep South so much. It was disappointing to have not had my high hopes realized with my second outing, but hope that it can be redeemed with a third. 
 This is going to sound like an exaggeration...but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I will admit that I didn't have high hopes for this film.  I mean, it didn't come out in theaters (at least in the U.S.), which is never a good sign, no movie store seems to have it in stock, and I read some pretty crippling reviews right here on good ol' Amazon.  But hey, I gave it a shot.  Boy, was that a mistake...  First of all, here's a quick synopsis: Years ago, King Hrothgar (Stellan Skarsgard) killed a troll, but took pity on the troll's son, Grendel (Ingvar Eggert Sigurosson), and left him alone.  Grendel, now full-grown, is seeking revenge on Hrothgar's kingdom.  Hearing of Hrothgar's plight, the fierce warrior Beowulf (Gerard Butler) comes to help the king kill Grendel.  Along the way Beowulf meets a witch/prostitute named Selma (Sarah Polley) and discovers that trolls have feelings too.  Now, we all know that Stellan Skarsgard and Gerard Butler are great actors, but in this movie they fumble with a halting and painfully corny script.  The script affects the acting, and the acting affects the film.  Secondly, though Sarah Polley is a lovely actress, she seems very misplaced in this film.  She's the ONLY character with an American accent and, in an age-old Anglo-Saxon myth, this is very, very out of place.  In addition, the small amount of weight that Gerard Butler has put on around the stomach area draws a little from his role as an unstoppable, highly-trained warrior.  The battle scenes are unnecessarily gory, with fake-looking and very blood-soaked limbs flying left and right.  They seem primitive compared to the battle scenes of other films.  The scene in which Beowulf fights Grendel's mother is especially bad - there's lots of shrieking and strobe-light-esque movements that seem almost comical in this day and age.  The only things that can be said in this movie's defense are that the sweeping Iceland landscapes are breathtaking and the Celtic monk (Eddie Marsan) is mildly-amusing in his efforts to convert everyone.  1-star...please don't waste 103 minutes of your life on this film 
 I bought this book in hopes that I would get some information on raising my gifted son. With the book still in my mind, I find it hard to even type the word "gifted" because I don't want to be seen as an elitist. I do agree with much of what she writes regarding the harmfulness of products such as Baby Einstein DVD's and the like, and I can vouch from personal experience that you cannot cause a child to be gifted intellectually. My oldest son is gifted, and when he was born I was only 20 and could not afford expensive educational toys and videos. I also didn't breastfeed him and he went to daycare part-time. I basically did everything wrong but he turned out gifted somehow.   Now that he is 9, he is starting to get the "nerd" comments, so I bought the book thinking that it may help him deal with that. The book makes me feel that I should hide my son from society, teach him that it is not o.k. to be different than the rest, and only speak the work "gifted" with my head hung down in shame. 
 I'm a fan of other Time Out guidebooks, particularly Time Out's Eating and Drinking in Rome, but this book is a huge disappointment.  First, the type is so tiny that it's difficult to read.  Second, the book is filled with advertisements - not just one or two but at least a hundred. This makes the book seem no better than the cheap guides you find for free in many hotel rooms. Third, in checking out just two things, I've found two errors. Ever hear of 22 volt electricity? That's what this book says runs in Argentina. (Correct voltage is 220 volts.) Another error is in giving the wrong page number for information about Teatro Colon. You are directed to page 198 which informs you instead about gay life in Buenos Aires. (The information about Teatro Colon is actually on page 204.) So, do I trust any other information in this book? Nope! Will I bother carrying this book with me to Buenos Aires? Absolutely not!   
 Perhaps I should have read more into the title, but this book is really just an intro to UML.  I was looking for a DB architecture book to boost my design skills but instead I got a basic UML book that just happens to be applied to data modeling.  If your looking for a book on database design, look elsewhere.  If your looking for a book on understanding UML applied to databases, pick this one up 
 i never even got this book because apparently its not a book yet amazons web site said it was. it took me 4 phone calls with 4 different customer service reps for some one to figure that out. all they gave me for the inconvenance was a 15 dollar amazon gift card which i tryed to use and doesn't work. i still don't have the book i needed and it is 4 weeks into the semester. i have baought other things from amazon and gotten them but this expeirance makes me never want to use amazon again. i would like to give you a review of the actual book but i never recieved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Ok lets get down to why you should save your money and NOT get this book. First of all the author dedicates two or three chapters on WHY chicks should sleep with chicks. Well if your buying this book then I would think that your already curious or interested, correct? Then the author shares some really great "secrets" on the where and how to pick up other chicks, let me take the time to write some of them down here for you, first this no brainer, "Get them intoxicated, and my all time favorite,"take them behind a dumpster and get them to smoke weed". The author then fills the book up with helpfull hints like, "go put an ad on the internet"  Dang, I would have never thought of that!! In summary, you can buy this book if you want, but don't expect anything other than common sense stuff, and I use the term VERY lightly!! Thank you for your time.  
 Historically inaccurate, a painfully rushed third act, and not up to the high standards set by Philippa Gregory's other Tudor novels. It reads like something written by a well-intentioned romance author. What amazed me was the author's decision to write a Katharine of Aragon that bore absolutely no resemblance to the historical figure. I've found all her previous Tudor character studies to be incredibly believeable(notwithstanding Elizabeth I's excessive randiness in The Virgin's Lover). Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, Anne of Cleves, Henry VIII himself, all seem to come alive. Why then is Katharine of Aragon groping her husband on her wedding night, dressing in the Tudor equivalent of a naughty negligee, and seducing her father-in-law for the sake of politics?  This "racy" view is completely at odds with every historical source which portrays Catalina de Aragon as a intensely religious, reserved woman who would never repeatedly perjure herself. For a rigorously devoted Roman Catholic to live such a lie her entire life (to say nothing of the sexual politics she is depicted as playing) would be live a life of sin. There is nothing in the historical record to ever suggest Katharine would choose that path.   If Philippa Gregory wants to write a purely fictitious re-imagining of Katharine of Aragon, that's fine (I've always wanted more exploration of what her life might have been like if Prince Arthur hadn't died). But to claim this character is based on fact is both laughable and insulting to all authors who strive for historical accuracy 
 I don't know why I thought I should purchase this book. I think it was because I like time travel stories and I like historical novels.  I had never even heard of Connie Willis, but she definitely has a bunch of readers that like her writing, so I decided to order this and a few others since Amazon had a sale on Mass Market paperbacks.  Oh, gosh, I can't believe I even read this book.  It was THAT bad!  Her characters were completely flat and flat-out unlikeable and even stupid!  The main male character was doltish.  His employer was less than impressive.  The 'bad' psychiatrist did so many unethical things that I had to look up the year the book was written more than once-- since it seemed that the only way he could still have his medical license would have been if he was practicing prior to 1940!  And, the main female character was just confusing and frustrating.  One of the main flaws of this book had to do with the author-character and the research assistant character.  Both of these characters were supposed to be historians very familiar with the Civil War specifically.  Some of the things they had to find out and had to research was common knowledge to anyone who studies the Civil War.  And, since both these characters had written several Civil War novels prior to the book they were working on in this novel, it seems they knew very little.    The other flaws were the lack of character development and story development.  We really know nothing of the characters except that they check their phone messages quite a bit, are scared of the psychiatrist for no real apparent reason except he is angry with both of them for leaving the area and severing the doctor/patient relationship, and fell in love immediately although there is nothing appealing about either one!  The story, too, is just weird.  There is no real closure or understanding about what happened. It's kind of left to our imagination, but it's not real clear why Annie had the dreams.  And, even if you decide you understand completely why Annie had the dreams, it makes absolutely no sense at all why we all don't have similar dreams.  Yes, all stories require a suspension of belief, but there should be some feasible explanation at the end.  This book lacked that.  I am trying one of the author's other novels, but I don't have high hopes for that one, either.  We'll see. .  
 It is clear that the author lacks command of the subject. He have no formal credentials in Islamic studies and he deliberately use certain interpretation to serve his political view. He is either misinformed or ignorant on the issue.  For example, in Islamic law, non-Muslims who live with Muslims need to pay a fee (jizyah)for securing their lives, and by paying this 'jizyah' the non-Muslims are not serving in the country's army. This 'Jizyah' is valid upon the non-Muslims (zimmi) to guarantee also their loyalty toward the country and the Islamic government protecting their security. However, non-Muslims living together with Muslims from the very first time in their country are freed from jizyah, since they are not involved in the process of war and subjugation. Even non-Muslims subjugated through the war, if they are not involved directly in a war, are freed also from jizyah, like children, women, and old people. And also the farmers and breeders who only do their job and are not involved in war, according to Imam Ahmad in sunnah books, are not subjected to jizyah.  But do not forget that Muslims must pay 'Zakah', which is much more than the 'Jizyah' and non-Muslims do not pay it.   If you want to read on that issue, pick a reliable source, that written by a real scholar. Do not waste your money with a politically motivated author.  
 The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to "preserve the life that is dear to him."  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of "24," but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write "Sunday," we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne 
 Rainbow fish has colorful shiny scales.  He is shamed into giving them to everyone.  Sounds like a communist primer 
 Very short game, took about 2 hours to finish it (took a lot longer than that for the junk steam system to activate it, because as always their "system is unavailable, please try again later" - took around six hours and 10 attempts before it was playable, and definately it will be the last steaming product I buy).   As to the game, you get 3 weapons and pretty much one set of scenary. Gameplay was average for a shooter. It seems "episodes" basically translates to "really short game, which just randomly ends leaving you wondering if you missed something". 
 How could Mr. Cameron take a subject like this and a cast and brig out the worst in everybody?  The production design and cinematopraphy are sumptuos, but the script and dialogue are so banal, the fine cast delivering one empty performance after another. (Including Leo, who was so good in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?" in 1993 when I didn't yet know who he was, I thought he was really a cute little retarded kid... yet in "Titanic", there's just nothing there--- or nothing permitted).   Talk about a SHIP wreck!!  Only the two studio-backed block voting resulted in the record-tying Oscar wins/nominations.    
 I'll start with the positive:  The main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall, good-looking, smart, humble, etc.  The story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow, carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words.  In short, it was a competent work of fiction.   That's where my praise ends, because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas.  Sure, it's a work of fiction, no one is going to take it seriously, yada yada yada.  But that's not true, is it?  So many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers.  Alright, here are my problems with it:  First, politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power, but that's not true if you're a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state.  In Term Limits, Vince Flynn just beats you over the head with the "power corrupts" mantra - he doesn't show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song, yet from the lips of the Marine Combat Veteran Congressman who is our protagonist.  You know what, though?  There are people in politics on BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE who really want to do what's right, who really are trying to make a difference for the positive, for this nation and the citizens.  In this book, however, the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they aren't smart enough to make good decisions.  Second, murder is a viable answer.  This repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land.  Come on, get real.  This book touts a Special Forces Unit as being so committed to the Constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he doesn't balance the budget.  And, they get away with it because it's really the right side to be on.  Murdering our leaders is the answer according to Vince Flynn.  Murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation, that being elections.  Elections apparently just get in the way.  Third, the balanced budget.  For years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget.  The book makes it the central theme.  Balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible.  It's important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel.  A Coup!!!  Yet, when the conservatives did take power, despite Vince Flynn's prescient forecasting ability, they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and didn't flinch.  Even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility, they claim that NOW!!!!! the deficit isn't a big deal, that it's really just a function of the percentage of GDP and we ought to all forget about it.  This book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90's and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later.  It's like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits.  Fourth, the good guys don't do bad things.  The Special Ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians.  The bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool.  Flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head with it . . . killing is good when only your target dies . . . but whatever happened to that oh so famous, though shalt not?  - CV Ric 
 I had this card for more than 6 months, and It worked super in my Canon Powershot A510. Transfers went well too. Then all of a sudden for no reason I kept getting "card error" on my computer and digital camera a week ago. My SD/USB converter couldn't find the card either. I had really good photos I wanted to transfer to my computer and now they are probably lost for good. What a joke 
 Definately doesn't live up to What to Expect the First Years.  Somethings are written very vaguely, if at all.  Recently we were looking up hives - nothing!!!!  Just a blurb.  Sorry Arlene Eisenberg, you need to take your time with these books and include everything before you just send it to the presses 
 im not a kid but i do know good music when i hear it and this is not it. this so rehashed and just not fresh at all. chorus about girls and their body parts.....verses about girls and their body parts....track 2 blatently rips off Ms New Booty, and the rhymes are nothing you havent heard before......overall just a whack effort. i wouldnt even recommend this for a party cd, unless you wanna make everyone clear out. these guys need to get a real job, which probably means working at Burger King. 
 I'm not going to go into my childhood, or how I love the Transformers or any of that stuff, I just wanted to give a quick review.  As always, you get what you pay for.  I bought this today and within five minutes of transforming it one of the joints popped out and I can't for the life of me get it to sit correctly back in the socket.    Bottom line is that it is very cool that ten dollars will get you a G1 inspired Astrorain or Starscream, but be aware these feel very flimsy and are definately better utilized sitting on your desk at work in robot mode than being transformed back and forth while you are bored watching TV.    Very cool, very flimsy, very inexpensive 
 The publishers made a typo error in this book's title - they added an "f".  Instead of "Another Life", it should more appropriately be titled "Another Lie."  Although it is a  well-written and fairly entertaining memoir, it is the Napoleonic ambitions  of its author that make it a very dubious and unreliable addition to any  non-fiction library.  Due to Michael Korda's supremely fragile ego, always  in danger of having to be placed in intensive care, everything in this book  must be viewed very skeptically.  Korda not only takes credit for himself  but distorts and erroneously states facts so that he can be the hero and  the mastermind.  After reading a few chapters, I became suspicious of  Korda's "memory" when he always appeared as the brilliant,  all-knowing catalyst of every event he was participating in.  When I came  to his chapter on his relationship with Graham Greene, I had the sense he  was exaggerating his teenage friendship with the famous author - logic just  wasn't on Korda's telling of the tale, especially since none of the  principals are alive to offer a differing view, as is true for most of  Korda's stories.  But, as for facts, I decided to do some research and  check what Korda was relating about his publshing career.  Alas, he has  created more fiction than fact in relating these tales.  I could write half  a book on his lies and misrepresentations, but I merely use one case in  point.  His experience with the bestselling novelist Susan Howatch.  On  pages 309 and 3l0 Korda presents Howatch as "some unknown woman in New  Jersey sitting at her kitchen table and holding her baby as she wrote"  the book which HE discovered and became the best seller  "Penmarric".  This was l970 and Korda paints the scene as if he  is plucking an unknown first author and using HIS great judgment to  determine that she, indeed, has written a great book.  ACTUALLY, Susan  Howatch had begun writing novels in l965 and was a successful and respected  author of three novels published by Stein & Day by the time Korda  caught up with her. It's rather clumsy and absurd to present her as his  discovery, BUT Korda goes on to state that he perceptively noticed the  subtle parallel between "Penmarric"'s plot and the lives of Henry  II and Eleanor of Aquitaine.  He relates how Howatch reluctantly confessed  to having borrowed the historical plot and was nervous that someone else  might also notice.  Korda, fully confident of his own superior brillance,  assured her that no one would, and he states that they went ahead and  published the book and not one reviewer commented on the Henry and Eleanor  similarities.  HOW CURIOUS.  Especially since Howatch's book states in  passages at the beginning of every chapter the Henry and Eleanor story and  how it applies to the following chapter.  She plainly wrote the parallel  right there in the book and used it for the structure of her novel.  And  every book review commented on this fact, especially the New York Times,  who thought it added greatly to the book's success.  What is Korda talking  about!  I'm afraid every chapter is filled with such self-serving lies and  erroneous facts that only serve to elevate poor little Michael Korda's  sense of self-importance.  The real crime here is how Korda gets away with  these very easily checkable lies and how his legendary Editor, Robert  Loomis of Random House, can allow this obvious distortion of truth to get  publish.  It's just not sloppy and careless editing, for which the aging  Loomis is becoming famous, it is the deliberate distortion of their own  industry and a real lowering of standards. This collaboration of Korda and  Loomis and its careless and fictionalized view of the New York book world  is far more eloquent than anything Mr. Korda has to say in his book. Yes,  book publishing really has gone downhill, and Korda and Loomis have taken  it another giant leap 
 I recieved it promptly, but it didn't work. I took it to Walmart to get a battery and they recommended going to a jeweler. I did that, buying a battery for twenty dollars and still cannot get the time to set right. I've read the manual over and over. My sons did the same. It looks nice but doesn't work and its been very aggravating. I wouldn't recommend it 
 The most telling remark I can make about this book, which I picked up for about $5 off a "publishers' overstock" pile in a bookstore, is that I learned far more facts about Mencken from the brief, anonymous wikipedia.org entry than from the 432 leaden pages of character assassination found here.  And... that I wish I had my $5 back.  Teachout (whoever that is) seems to appreciate Mencken as a writer and despise him as a person.  There are two aspects to Mencken's character that can be best understood by noticing two stereotypes he fits into.  Teachout notices neither.  Let me illucidate: (1) Mencken fits into the familiar modern stereotype of "nerd"--- he lived with his mother for most of  his life, and did most of his work in the same bedroom he occupied as a small child.  He was a compulsive worker, tended to avoid entanglements with women, was overweight and out of shape... need I go on? He held at arm's length any female he knew who was interested in  sex (to judge by the contents of their surviving letters to him), only married after his mother died, and married an invalid whom doctors had (correctly) assured him could not live more than 5 years.  After her death, he immediately moved back to the old homestead, living now with his unmarried brother and two servants inherited from his brief married days.  (2) He was self-educated, and so never examined the received prejudices about "alien and inferior races and cultures" and the unworkability of "democratic" institutions he had absorbed as a small child.  The writer H. P. Lovecraft (whom Teachout might never have heard of, and who was also and not coincidentally an ur-nerd) invites very close comparison with Mencken in many, if not in all, such aspects.  Like Lovecraft, he wrote many public and private diatribes against the Jews in the abstract, yet had many close Jewish friends and associates. Like Lovecraft, he tended not to view with alarm the rise of fascism in Europe.  Mencken is still of great interest as a social and political critic, as a scholar of American english usage, and as the master of a prose style so forceful and vivid that it practically leaps off the page and strikes you between the eyes like a vaudeville slapstick. What Mencken needs is for more of his books to be brought back into print and adequately publicized.  Teachout, to his credit, has worked effectively to get more of Mencken into print, but still, on a recent visit to two large bookstores, one carrying new books and one used books, I was able to locate precisely ZERO works by Mencken on any topic.  Let me give HLM himself the last word: "As democracy is perfected, the office [of the President] represents more and more closely the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron." [HLM in the Baltimore Sun, July 26, 1920.] We had to wait 80 more years, but... 
 Dreck, dreck, dreck, dreck,dreck, dreck, dreck, dreck, dreck, dreck,more dreck, more dreck, more dreck, more dreck, more dreck, more dreck, more dreck, and more dreck, and more dreck, and more dreck . . . you get the idea 
 Having read Bridget Jones & Fielding's lastest novel I was excited to read Cause Celeb.  From the very beginning I was disappointed.  The lead character is not really developed & she makes choice that I cannot understand or respect.  She ended up driving me nuts, as did almost every character in the book.  The dialogue for certain characters, like Nadia & Andre, was very annoying & was hard to read smoothly.  There is also very little humor or romance in this book.  While you feel for the refugee story the rest of it is pure cr*p and should be avoided. 
 How can one man be endowed with such knowledge, how to cure every single disease known!!! How do you do it? What is the secret to your genius!?!  Please, the world is dying to know---Wait, I think there's a cure for that on page 87...  
 Praise the author all you want, but I have to take a different view. Eveybody has 15 minutes of fame, and I guess this is mine.  Somewhere in the first 30 pages (I believe; it's been a long time since I read it.) there's the recounting of an experience by a Univ of Mich student and his gay roommate. And how he moved out after I (Yes, that's right. I'm the gay roommate.) had put up a beefcake poster. No mention in the book of the Budweiser Boob poster I had to look at. Nobody interviewed me for the book to get my side of the story. A bit of a one-sided argument by the author if you ask me.  It's been over 20 years, but if I remember correctly, my roommate was Jewish. Would I be allowed to break my housing contract because of my roommate's faith? or because of his sexual orientation (STRAIGHT)? No. So, I think the administration was right in chastising him for stating my sexual orientation as grounds for contract release.  Life isn't all wine and roses. Some have an easier time of it than others based solely on having the right(?) skin color, gender, race, sexual orientation, etc. Until the laws and society ensure that ALL are treated equally, then those in the minority will have to continue to push a little harder to get their point across. If this causes the majority to re-evaluate their standards and expectations of what's right, then so be it.  "Reverse discrimination" isn't discrimination when those who benefit from it are afforded the same rights and priviledges that the majority takes for granted.  
 Hotel World is a disappointing little book.  For all of its accolades and promise, it falls incredibly short.  The story sounded promising, five women, two sisters, one dead.  Unusual writing style, somewhat unformatted and different. Different sounded promising rather than annoying. I thought the characters mostly unlikeable and mousy.  I found one character's chapter to be completely unreadable due to the complete lack of any punctuation.     
 Believe it or not, I actually wanted to watch this movie.  I've seen almost everything else Adrian Lyne has done and respect his shallow talent enough to be interested in his early efforts.  (I watched _Jacob's Ladder_ because I remembered an intriguing preview on a VHS cassette I watched as a kid and learning that it was a significant influence on _Silent Hill_ sealed the deal; My girlfriend owns a copy of Lyne's version of _Lolita_; _Fatal Attraction_ was a girlfriend induced rental; I watched the TV version of _Indecent Proposal_; I haven't seen _9 1/2 Weeks_ but I read the book.)   Flashdance is also one of those pieces of pop culture that are so influential that you recognize references even if you've never seen it.  And I always wanted to hear the song "Maniac" in its original context, so when I found it on an acquaintances shelf I popped it in.  So, how was it?  Not too bad.  Not great by any means, or even really that good (_Lolita_ and _Jacob's Ladder_ are both quite good) but interesting enough to keep me awake after a long day of work.  The plot is a by-the-book "believe in your dreams" story with really lame dialog, but its development is intercut with extended dancing sequences that are so long and frequent that at times it felt like I was watching an abstract silent film.  I don't know squat about dancing, but the choreography seemed innovative, at least for its time.  I can't even remember the names of the characters, but all in all, I have to admit that it was kind of neat.  Also, if you watch it with the subsequent 20+ years of movies in mind, _Flashdance_ can be seen as sort of an omen of all bad things to come from Hollywood:  It's a movie by a director whose only previous experience was in music videos and commercials, one whose screenplay was an early effort by hack Joe Esterhasz and was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer!  Taken collectively these elements are probably responsible for about 60% of all crap movies made since 
 I could not watch all it because one disc will not play.  What I could watch of the series, I would rate a 5 star 
 This textbook is a paradigm in the art of conciseness:  while I admire Miessler and Tarr's ability to convey the massive amount of every chapter in so few pages, it makes for extraordinarily difficult.  My professor thought this would be a useful text to cover our introductory class, as it does not waste time on basic information on periodicity, etc. However, after a few weeks of telling us what not to read (as it was far too abstruse), and resorting to other textbooks, she had to give up altogether on this one.  I imagine this work's chief usefulness will come to graduate students needing a "refresher", but not to anyone else.  There are too few grainy pictures, questions that rarely relate to the material in the chapter, and a text whose density rivals the Bible 
 I received the clock in good condition, but, even though I tried several batteries, it never worked. I did not return it because the shipping would have cost more than the clock! It ended up in the trash. I guess you really do get what you pay for 
 While this story is truly an essential writing of Dostoevsky, it lacks the appropriate context to be read as sold in this copy.  If you are interested in reading "The Grand Inquisitor" without reading the rest of The Brothers Karamazov, I would recommend the Guignon edition, sold for only a little more.  This work includes the two chapters preceeding "The Grand Inquisitor" as well as what Dostoevsky intended as the refutation for this tale, "The Russian Monk," which follows this legend.  Dostoevsky did not intend for this to be separated from the book as a whole, but I think it could be legitimately done when read with a little more context than is present in this copy.  Additionally, this alternate edition includes a very complete introduction by Charles Guignon, which is much more informative than the brief one by Anne Fremantle provided in this copy.  It is important to remember that "The Grand Inquistor" was not Dostoevsky's final answer in The Brothers Karamazov.  Reading this edition alone provides a flawed view of both Dostoevsky's writing and philosophy and The Brothers Karamazov.  I would recommend reading the book as a whole instead [and I particularly recommend the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation for that: it is much more accurate to the original Russian].  Or at a minimum, reading the other edition of this book.  Either way, you will get a more complete glimpse to the genius of Dostoevsky, which this fails to provide.  The Grand Inquisitor is truly an essential read, but not in this presentation of it 
 Hello to all those who have read this book.  After reading your reviews abour this book i felt i must say something.  WHy are you so set against God and Christianity?  One of you said this book was what made him rejest Christianity.  Christianity is not some weird religion,  it is the faith that Jesus Christ died for all humans, who He loves so much.  Where are you going after you die?  Christ is waiting for you to call to Him and ask for eternal life.  The Bible isnt some whack job scribbling stuff down, it is God inspired.  There are more manuscripts and texts to prove the Bible is real and written by those who claimed to write it.  there are more manuscripts than that of Homer's The Odyssey, yet we regard that as true.  So the Gospels werent written right after the disciples were with Jesus, but they were written at a time when those people could still remember their times with Christ.  I am going to wrap it up now, but if you want to hear the real TRUTH, read God's Word.  If you don't believe that, there are so many books that so the incredible evidence for the Bible.  The Age of Reason was written by a man who hated Christianity.  PLease do not just accept his writing without looking at the BIble.  Jesus Christ loves you, and he longs for you to accept Him so He can change your life and give you the awesome gift of eternal life with Him.  Thank you 
 Not worth the time or money. Nothing new, not even the title 
 Barna's writing is awful and his statistics given are misleading.  He spends a good deal of the book seperating Christians into groups and showing which group is "best" in his opinion.  For Christians who haven't developed their own sense of scripture and the teachings of Christ, this book can be misleading and cause people to fall into judgment of other Christian groups.  As a Catholic I found the book highly offensive because I know Barna counted me as a "non-born-again Christian" and that I fell into the bad Christian catagory, which I don't agree with.  Christians should respect all other Christians no matter what their denomination, we should not be divided, we should be united.    Barna owns a marketing and researching firm, he is not a biblical scholar, he's just trying to market HIS OWN misconceptions to you, which you don't need, SAVE YOUR MONEY, tith it to your church or a charity, don't waste it on this book 
 Schaeffer has a few valid points that could be developed into strong arguments to support his thesis, yet he fails to organize his thoughts and he does not substantiate his claims with concrete examples. This book needs strong editing and perhaps the ranting could be turned down a few notches as well 
 This book is full of useful advice, but do not mistake it for instruction on how to become a gentleman. Despite what one would think, I have come to appreciate this term "Metrosexual" as it distinguishes those who use manners and the appearance of urbane sophistication for their own self-advancement from true gentlemen.  True gentlemen show respect for themselves and others, bringing the light of civilization to a darkening world, and leaving society better for their efforts.  A gentleman's manners, urbanity and consideration are a lifestyle, not a mask that is donned for selfish convenience.  Thus, if one is seeking to become a metrosexual, this book fits the bill.  If one wants to be a gentleman, keep shopping 
 I don't know much about Lars Frederiksen, but he obviously doesn't think much of his band. He knows them a lot better than I do so he may be right, but I'm prepared to give them a chance. This is more of a compilation of other artists than a Lars Frediriksen album. Lars takes his vocal stylings from one popular punk rock band, while his drummer copies another, his guitarists steal from another, etc. I don't know which bands are borrowed from because they all sound the same to me. The man on the cover of this album has a mohawk hair cut which shows he is a big fan of the A-Team and Mr. T. I bought this album expecting to hear something Mr. T would be proud of and maybe some songs about Mr. T, but instead Lars chooses to whine selfishly about his own life. He breaks from this however to sing "Army of Zombies", a song about the SNES game "Zombies Ate My Neighbours". Overall this a decent Rancid album 
   Their first book was actually helpful, and a bit of a novelty. It offered a different approach to cleaning that was geared toward the genetically disorganized, designed by genuine slobs. This was refreshing compared to a lot of the organizational books written by the naturally and freakishly organized trying to feign empathy for their inferior readers.    However, this book doesn't have anything new to say. I felt like I was wasting time reading it because so much of the book was devoted to the authors going into detail about their personal family problems, which really doesn't help the dishes in my sink, laundry on my couch and the Polly pockets on the floor waiting patiently to embed themselves in an unsuspecting foot.   I get the distinct impression that this book was an excuse for them to make more money. But, it does rehash their original ideas, which were all useful. Their first one was their best one, but this is better than nothing. 
 Not satisfied because there are no  pictures of the birds....was in Puerto Escondido Mexico last season and saw so many birds, so bought this book for the next trip, but no pictures !  My local bird book in New York has all the pictures, which I think is key identifiying the birds....words just are not the same ....the book is so dry without colored pictures compared to other birding books.... 
 Tony, in his book, said, "To me success is the ongoing process of striving to be more. ... It is a progressive course, not an end to be reached."  And why is success "striving to be more" and what is "more" and why isn't an end to be reached? Well, it's because Tony thinks so, and "juz cuz" is good enough for him.  He gives stupid advice like saying not to worry about the small stuff because all such concerns are small. Are you kidding, it's all small? Where'd his common sense go? Jesus said you shouldn't worry at all, but not because it's all small, but because it doesn't help and God (if you are saved) will give you prosperity ultimately.  His good advice is vague and common sense advice, and in no way needs to be lodged in his huge overpriced book. Here are some examples of his keys to happiness and riches, or what I call, "Big Duh's, Why are You Telling People the Obvious, Do You Really Think We're All That Stupid Tony":  1. Learn how to handle rejection 2. Learn how to handle financial pressure (and after saying that gives this way to handle it: to give away 10 percent of what own. Why? Not because the Bible allegedly says so (and it doesn't) but because the author of "The Richest Man in Babylon" said to do it. 3. Learn how to handle complancency (it should say, "Don't be complacent") 4. Learn how to judge yourself by goals instead of what peers seem to be doing. (And he adds confusing statement by saying that you can always find justification for what you are doing by looking to see what someone else is doing. And that instead of that you should do what you want [I'm not kidding that is how shallow and illogical his advice is.]  Rather then judging yourself by your goals and using whatever standard, you should judge yourself AND YOUR GOALS based on whether or not you're obeying God and whether or not your goals are not against God's laws. Tony doesn't tell you what to judge them against, I'm assuming your own since he says not to look to what others are doing, but are a person's own standards necessarily better than anyone elses? OF COURSE NOT.  Second, his statement: "Learn how to judge yourself by goals instead of what peers seem to be doing" is poorly worded. To say "seems" is reduntant, and even without that confusing little addition, why didn't he just say, "Learn to judge yourself by goals, not the goals of others." Wouldn't that have made more sense? Why contrast "goals" will everything else another person does IN ADDITION to their goals, wouldn't it make more sense to contrast EVERYTHING you do against "what others seem to be doing"? This is a sloppy, poorly thought out book.  And what does he mean "learn" to judge yourself? Learn what about it? Help us out Tony, how can we "learn" to judge ourselves? What's to learn? Bizarre.  His last key is  5. Always give more than you expect to recieve. (A cheap warped rip off of the Bible. The Bible says, "It is better to give then to recieve." How honorable of Tony to give the source of his twisted logic eh?  Find a better book and save your mind from his vain insanity.     
 21/2 SCOOPS OUT OF  FIVE.  OBVIOUSLY SOME VERY TALENTED PLAYERS HERE, SOME MOMENTS OF COMPLEXITY HERE AND THERE, BUT THE MATERIAL IS POOPY. FOR MY PERSONAL TATSE, THIS WOULD GET A BIG FAT LONELY STAR, BUT IT'S NOT REALLY BAD MUSIC, I JUST COULD NOT GET IT. THE PRODUCTION IS TYPICAL OF EARLY 90'S, WAY OVERDONE, SHINY, ARTIFICIAL, THERE'S NO PROPER SPACIAL IMAGERY AT ALL. CAN YOU SAY COMPRESSION? YUCK. NOT THE GREASY, SWEATY FUNK FROM THE 70'S. MADE ME THINK OF BEING IN AN ICE CREAM PARLOR AT TIMES. WERE THESE TRACKS LEFTOVERS FROM BAD 1989-90 SESSIONS OR WHAT 
 I didn't like the book Freak The Mighty. I just like it at all. It was a book that I never would have read if it weren't for our class Literature Circle. I didn't like it because it was a book that didn't have a good plot, and it jumps around alot 
 I am a big fan of Michael Connelley's.  He usually writes about very bright police officers.   I do not know why he wandered so far away from familiar territory, but he has managed to create a character -- Henry Pierce -- who may be a genius, but is also unbelievably stupid.   I cannot accept the reasons that he tries to learn about a missing escort simply because he was given her former phone number.   He not only puts his life at risk but his entire company and the careers of his associates.  I was so disappointed in Henry Pierce that I began to side with those who wanted to arrest him or kill him.   That might have been the most satisfying ending.   I won't give up on Michael Connelley -- books he wrote since Chasing the Dime were better, including one that moved into the courtroom.   However, I will no longer assume that his name on the dustjacket insures a great read.    
 Without religion it would be easy to see good men doing good things and bad men doing bad things.  With religion bad men can do bad things and justify those things under the guise of religion.  However good men can also do bad things behind the same religion.  Here we have a fine example of either.  You can pick which man you see here.  Whichever way you go it does not remove the fact that BAD things have been done.  That is the message of this book 
 I am an avid reader and I am not sure what to make of the other individuals' assessments of this novel.  I gave it 2 stars because the writing wasn't horible, but I did not see any development in the characters or any compelling reason to become engaged in the story.    Written almost entirely from Lorna's perspective (with the exception of about 5 pages), readers are unable to see any internal dimensions to the other characters.  Even when written from Lorna's perspective, there are no clear dimensions to her character either.  There were attempts to provide depth to personalities, but, in my opinion, ultimately failed.  Instead, I found myself unable to really care what happened to the members of the story. Most people want characters who maintain a level of complexity, whose stories evoke some sort of emotional response.  These characters provided none of these things.  If you want to read a romantic suspense with no romance or suspense in it, then this is a perfect choice.  Even knowing this, I wouldn't get my hopes up. Try a Nora Roberts, Suzanne Brockmann or a Tami Hoag for characters with depth and a story that compells you to not put the book down.  This book just wasn't it 
 Let me start by saying I love a good historical fiction book.  I picked up a copy of this one, after reading the reviews by others.  Obviously I don't have the same taste in books.  So not to knock anyone's thoughts of this book, but...Quite possibly this is one of the worst books in the already tastelessly saturated genre!  And I don't even pretend to have high standards!!!  Never have I seen a book so filled with cardboard characters (I won't even mention the awful stereotyping), completely predictable storyline, (which is one of the most preposterous I've ever read, by the way), and so overwrought with tacky metaphors.  I nearly died at the use of the supposed "local dialect".  I have never wanted to stop reading a book because it was so bad, but as they say, "never say never".  I read this to the end, just to see if it would get any better.  I thought it was turning a corner then wham!, the passage about the vegetables.  Why, oh why?!?  **To be perfectly honest, I was more curious to see whether this book could possibly get any WORSE, highly entertaining that it did!**  If you're not looking for a serious read, and would like a few juicy love scenes, then this book fits the bill.  (As I try to find a positive in everything).  Images of cheap dime store romance novels are forever emblazoned in my memory when I think of this book!  I find it impossible to take this book seriously.  I'd give it 0 stars, if possible.  My apologies to those who enjoyed this one!  If you want a sweet love story, set in a historical period, try Patience and Sarah by Isabel Miller.    
 I guess I was hoping for more about the company and people. This book has lots of pictures and ads with some discriptions of the guns. It's not what I thought I was getting, the title should be changed to a "Pictorial of The First 100 yeras of Daisy Guns" 
 This book seems an effort for including in two volumes a wide vision of quantum relativistic and non relativistic theory. The result is erratic. In the first chapters, messiah accumulate an enormous quantity of material: The old ondulatory mechanics is remixed with some formal modern approach, poorly logical matched, provoke a great confusion. The chapter dedicated to central potentials and scattering contains a lot of formulas not deduced in the text, and the reader is compelled to the appendixes that are very disordered. There is no logical ordering in this part of the book too. The chapter dedicated to angular momentum is in some extent influenced by the nuclear physics orientation of the whole book, and offers some very difficult problems next to easy ones. Symmetries are very formally treated, and the author offers some mathematic instruments poorly explained. The effort along the book to maintain a rigurous dirac notation make it entagled, and the case of the perturbation theory is really hard to understand for this reason. The best chaters of the book are those contained in  the last part(relativistic quantum mechanics), and the introduction to the quantized field theory, thus the whole valoration of the book can not be very good. 
 This book is a bore. Middle class English in the 60s. Everything that needs to be said has been said. Why bring this subject back up in the 1990s. Another English writer who writes beautifully but unfortunately, has nothing to say

 After two hours of watching it, I still don't know what it was about.  Yes, the scenery is fantastic, but a National Geographic film would have done more.    I applaud the acting of Milla Jovovich, and Nastassja Kinski.  But, the kudos reviewers have given to Peter Mullen would have been better deserved if this were a silent movie.  I hardly heard anything he said and there are no English subtitles offered on the dvd.  As for Wes Bentley, that's acting?  He kept the same expression when he was having sex as when he was having a gun pointed at him, or a co-worker being blown to "Kingdom Come" (that's a pun based on the movie).  He makes Clint Eastwood look like Laurence Olivier.    The film is supposedly based on a Thomas Hardy book, but very loosely based, and the scriptwriters should have at least used Cliff Notes to have learned more about the story and the character development.  They obviously fell asleep after the first couple of chapters and made up the rest.   
 There is some helpful advice here on the basics, but nothing that one could not find elsewhere.  Additionally, this book leaves one with the impression that the authors are not trying to help young men become gentlemen, but rather how to appear to be gentlemen whilst getting away with behavior that is distinctly ungentlemanly.    Because of the unsettling and slightly slimy feeling one gets from reading it, it occurs to me that Eddie Haskell might have been at least an editorial consultant, if not the author. 
 This book was a big disappointment. I was hoping for detailed instructions for the construction of a studio, and what I got was a refresher course in Acoustics 101. The book has a lot of theory which could be helpful to someone that doesn't already know about diffusion, absorbtion and reflection of sound waves. What it doesn't have is room dimensions, angles of walls, or decent illustrations. The illustration for a garage multi-track studio was literally a line drawing of a square with a bisecting line across the corner signifying what would be a disfunctional control room. If you're not ready to build a studio and want some good information on room modes and acoustics, this is a good enough book. If you want to apply these principles and actually build a studio, there are better instructions on several free websites 
 Martha, Martha, Martha!  I thought you were on par with your brother, but I guess I was mistaken!  I am fascinated and enamored with Rufus and his repertoire, so naturally, I was willing to give Martha a good "college try".  Well, I found this music to be boring and the lyrics just not "there".  This one's going to Goodwill.  There is MAYBE one song that I would listen to again, that might grow on me over time and make it into my "rotation".  But Rufus has something indescribable, for me, that Martha just "ain't got".  I think she should stick to being backup for her brother, as their voices blend beautifully.  Martha, hat's off to you for trying to find your own voice, but you should cede the crown to your brother

 I don't know how this book managed to get a 4-1/2 star review which is why I bought it.  After seeing an interview with Carl Hiaasen I decided to try his books, starting with his first one.  This is one of the worst books I've ever read.  Hanging the psychiatrist out a window by his feet is too incredible to believe (I had to reread the paragraph to be sure that's what was happening), but then locking the door on a hospital room and having sex in the room while recovering from surgery was the last straw.  After reading 190 pages I finally spared myself the torture of finishing the book.  It found it's way to the trash can.  Don't waste your time on this 
 I found this book a truly disapointment !! When i started the book , the story of Abby and Lucian was so intense , so passionate that i thought i was going to love it . Then the book advances to this days with the story of Declan and Lena , and it was ugelly disapointing !! They don't have anything in commun with Abby and Lucian !! Lena and Declan , they don't work as a couple in love ; to me they was no chemestry or anything between them . I only read the book till the end because i wanted to know how it was going to end with Abby and Lucian , but that too was a little beyond what i thought it was going to be , they deserv a better ending , i don't now how but that was not what i expected ! 
 How many times can I say pompous?   These authors have so inflated their egos that I can not imagine sharing a room with them.  I certainly would not want to share an office or any job with them.  The authors love "technology" - and that can be a good thing. However, they so completely mix up the means and the ends. In teaching a well educated student is the "ends" or our product.  Give me a tent and something to scrawl on and a good teacher will put out a good product: a well educated student.    Technology is a tool we can use.  Just like any other tool when people see someone using it, AND it improves the job in some manner they will switch over to the new method.   The emphasis on technology is wasteful.  All, yes 100%, of the information this book is devoted to can be picked up by anyone in a single semester course.  This is from a teacher who: always uses an electronic grade book, posts assignments and other information on my web page, has converted almost all of my lectures into PowerPoint presentations filled with pictures, QuickTime video shorts, links to current events in the news.  My students have assignments which require internet research.  Some of their assignments they can access from anywhere (on vacation in New Zealand!), at any time, with or with out partners, and can use a wide variety of resources.    My students score well on state tests, actually really well.  However, with no "technology" (a tent and some chalk and slates) they will still do well.  Let's not confuse the tools with the real job, and these tools are VERY easy to learn.   If it makes sense people will do it, use it - if not - they SHOULD not 
 Dr. Dolittle has fallen afoul of the PC police, well before they were so named.  This edition is heavily adulterated to maintain political correctness.  Unfortunately, you must read the afterword to understand this.  A great story, a bad edition 
 We used this book in my accounting class. The coverage jumped around a too much for my taste. Also, not having an accounting background, the constant language changes (with no cross references and very superficial glossary), especially between the chapter text and the exercises made the endeavor excruciating. The worst part was not being able to check answers. The answer key should come with the book. Not having an answer key invalidates this books use as a learning tool even if it were better written 
 The cover is by far the best art in this book...  There are some other good ones inside, but most are incredibly poorly drawn and not very erotic at all; why they bothered putting a hard cover on such an amateurish effort is beyond me.  Even the ones that are well drawn mostly just look like normal women with wings added as an afterthought.  Bottom line, I'll snip out a few pictures to keep as art reference and throw away the rest.  
 From boorish to just plain bad, Blur does it all.  In Stone Roses banked baggy like "She's So High", "There's No Other Way", and "Bang!" all swirly lights and additive dissolves, Damon Albarn manages to make a utter fool of himself with a ridiculous haircut and even more ridiculous smug lip synching mug.    Other videos come off as cheap, cheesy, under funded, art school schlock.  The Damien Hirst assisted "Country House" is bad.  Just plain bad down to its brainless bimbos in dress up and pancake lighting.  "Boys and Girls" is a green screen tragedy.  "For Tomorrow" mixes one of the few admirable moments of film with strobing, low frame rate video.    I must sing the praises, however, of "The Universal" one of the worst Blur songs with one of the best videos.  The lush beauty of Clockwork Orange gang Blur in heaven preaching their inane gospel to a 1984 mass through a 2001 bubble speaker is the only saving grace that makes the DVD worth the plastic it's printed on.  The case and booklet remain excess baggage.  This DVD makes me sad.  Pretensions and ego abounds doing nothing for aesthetic.  A few of the videos are just live concert footage dubbed over with studio tracks, the lowest of the low.  Others may look okay but concepts are hackneyed or art house rip-offs.  Even the talented David Mould couldn't save this blundering boat from sinking.  Ugly, cheap, and painful to look at, Blur may not be the worst band to ever exist but they certainly have some of the worst videos 
 Great photos but ponderous writing.  Page 83 excerpt, "The architects clearly enjoyed the possibilities of this experimental architectural archeology whereby a fundamentalist concept of authenticity is replaced by an inclusive and imaginative view of historical processes.&quot 
 Okay, I had to read this book for a Fantasy Lit. class I am taking.  My teacher and all of my fellow classmates, it seems, find it hilarious.  I, however, am left wondering:  why?    I understand what he's getting at with religion and what not, I've just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors.  The characters are boring and flat.  His humor is downright stupid.  This book is not clever in the least.  If you don't know the things he's pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty, you really need to think for yourself.    I guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel.  But then, the back of the book does say he is a popular author, and like most things that are popular, it must be accessible to the public or else they won't understand.     
 Having read the three books in the series I have to agree with a previous reviewer in that they are a pleasant enough read.....but the worrying aspect of many of Bruce's assertions is how often he "doubts" what he is experiencinge.g. when he is sitting eating a meal in a  restaurant he makes an imaginative voyage to the site of the Oklahoma  bombing and performs a rescue of tormented and lost souls who have been  killed there and he passes them on to helpers in the other side..... very  good and laudible but he expresses "doubts"..he has been honest  enough in his "Afterlife Knowledge" site that he has only had a  few "fully blown classic" OBE's in his life...all the other  "trips" have been done by his form of "Creative  Imagination" and so on...I only worry that this "Hey isn't it fun  and really helpful to save souls by imagining, ( and he usues the word  "pretending"! ) that they are here and we are with them"  approach will only give succour to the sceptics...I hate to be awkward but  if I was in a state of distress in the afterlife environment I would far  rather get help from someone having a "fully blown" OBE rather  than a fairly easy "creative/pretended imagination"...In saying  all this negative stuff I have to state that I think,p[aradoxically, his  "pretended/creative imaginations ,might actually help a LOT of people  get into the OBE mode...as those of us who are fortunate enough to have  OBE'd we are aware that such imaginings actually do help in this  regard...but of course we do not want to get "stuck" at that  level......it isn't very satisfactory or veriical to ourselves let alone  anyone else....so sadly, I cannot recommend the series very highly although  they are a better deal than a lot of the NewAge rubbish that is flooding  the market... 
 An awful yawner.  It shows all the reasons chivalry made for tiresome tales, and why the world needed Don Quixote so badly.  The Chretien de Troyes version of Lancelot is repetitious, has many loose ends, and is full of plot holes.  Lancelot jumps into a cart to shame himself in pursuit of Guenivere.  Before Lancelot jumps into the cart, the narrator states that "reason is the enemy of love."  In the scope of the book, and the code of chivalry, reason is the enemy of this genre.  Take with Nyquil. 
 Although the book and information is helpful and thoroughly useful,  this is not what I was looking for.   I am having a hard time finding -  a social area - party area - for outdoors to build along side of the pool.   We find we need an (approx 25 x 12) area  for indoor/outdoor use when we entertain 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 I am a long-time fan of the boys from Brum and can honestly say that this release is horrid. They recorded the disc as a disjointed unit where everything befroe was as a team. The slick effort and reliance on electronic music shows big time.  I have played their other discs non-stop throughout the years but "Homegrown" is one that was played three times and each time I never got past track #4.   Save your cash on this one. A truely bad effort. They did, however, hit gold when they recorded their recent "Who You Fighting For." Now that one is worth the $$$ 
 Though I respected Allan Bloom's translation and introduction to Rousseau's "Emile", "The Closing of the American Mind" shows his inadequacy as a social theorist as well as an academic.  The worthy, though somewhat obvious, point here is Bloom's recognition of America's movement away from intellectualism.  Ironically, this work filled with tenuous arguements makes a case that intellectuals (if one considers Bloom this) have very little to offer (and may be incapable of understanding) society. His comments on music, culture, and race are embarrassingly naive and insipid.  One of the more glaring deficiencies here was the treatment of German philosophy; I don't know that there is a notable scholar who has more misunderstood Nietzsche than Bloom.  He should stick to translating French and leave interpretation up to more worthy critics.    
 I wish I had read the other review before buying this for my son.  I agree that the motion of the ball is horrible.  It either barely moves or rolls in a weak circle.  It has definitely not encouraged my son to crawl!  The lights and sounds are pretty hard to understand, and overall, my son likes to play with the ball more when it's OFF!  
 The arrogance of the writing is the salient feature here.  Presuming that the reader is able to effortlessly follow complex topics, the author seems to be too content to create an elaborate display of his own intelligence in  the subject matter without making sure that the proper foundations are laid  for any sense of comprenhension for those who may be left behind.  It is  obvious that Kramer does indeed know the material, yet his prose is often  caught up in its own self-indulgence 
 These disks would not work with my Sony brand DVD writer. I have tried several other brands and so far everything works but Memorex. 
 I found this book enyoyable until I guessed who did it fairly early on. I  liked the character who narrated the story and would try another book by  this author 
 I bought this book because there were several glowing reviews of its content.  The suggestions in this book are not creative at all!!  I am not creative by nature, but I had thought of most of  the ideas listed here.  There are sections by age, but each section is small and you could do all of the items in one weekend.  The songs and rhymes were the only thing of value in the book.  Thumbs down 
 Disorganized vapid prose and loads of wishful "thinking" - it's a gender feminist cream dream.  Better you should read Proust for artistic insight on the topic, and look for a better written and more factual history 
 A disappointing book about a fabulous story.  The book reads as if it was pasted together from press cuttings and, if you look at the chapter notes, this appears to be how it was researched.  There are little irritants, such as referring to Steve Jobs as "Steve" as if he's a close friend, but the big problem is that it recounts a number of interesting incidents in Steve Jobs' career while missing the main story.  And what a fantastic story that is.  I hope that someone has written a decent account of Steve Jobs' life because I would like to read it.    One thing is certain: "iCon" sure ain't it. 
 "Knits From a Painter's Palette: Modular Masterpieces in Hand Painted Yarn" is what I expected from the title of the book, pictures I had seen of it and the reviews I read.  I am not one bit sorry I bought it.  But I wish it was so much more than it is.  Having knit with Painter's Palette, I can attest that the yarn is close to magical, a magic the book does not get across at all.  Charlotte's Web, for example, why would anybody photograph this beauty with the light behind it, focusing on the pattern which is not what the shawl is about at all? I suggest that anyone who wants to understand Charlotte's Web in Painter's Palette google it to see what it really looks like.  Probably the photos of the Butterfly Poncho best convey the beauty of the yarn, but in general, neither the photography nor the modular knitted items do Painter's Palette justice.  I realize Maie Landra is an artist and expert knitter, but modular knitting is not new and the results  actually appear more restricted than innovative so it's puzzling that she would find it particularly interesting.    Koigu is wonderful, I am grateful to Landra for it, I would never not have bought this book, but can't we have a second one with a few more garments ordinary knitters like me could dream about making or maybe even actually make? And please, please, different art directors, photographers, etc.--in fact, how about a different publisher altogether as this one clearly wasn't up to the job 
 I read this book as part of graduate seminar on civil wars and found it to be a complete letdown. The amount of quality literature in English about Africa is fairly slim, and this book does little to reverse that trend. The premise of this book is to apply a model for explaining civil war onset that was developed by two scholars out of the World Bank. Through statistical analysis, they argue that lootable commodities provide opportunities for rebels to finance war, therefore leading to war. Grievances on the part of combatants, either against the state or other groups are not important. Most of the chapters in this book are poor attempts to directly apply this model to case studies such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Mozambique, Senegal, Mali, and more. Some chapters are better than others, but it seems pretty obvious throughout the work that the individual chapter authors were under a great deal of pressure to say the quantitative  model explains well each case. One example is the poorly written chapter on the DRC, that had four conflicts, of which the model predicted two wrongly and the other two correctly, although the authors emphasize completely different factors than those specified in the model. However, this case ends with the argument that the model works well for the DRC. This direct application without a full overview of each conflict is frustrating in that for those who do not know these conflicts well, little can be gained from the chapters and it is difficult to judge how well the model works. For area specialists, it will probably be even more frustrating as many important factors are left out of each chapter, such as the role of the state. Stay away from this book.. 
 This isn't a great read. The story feels static. Nothing much happens. The narrator (Cath) goes on and on about her life now, her two failed marriages, her children (who are not well-developed characters), and her desire to learn more about her grandmother. The grandmother's story, unfortunately, isn't any more interesting. I kept waiting for the climax, the epithany, something, anything, to break up the monotony of the narrative, but it never came.  
 Three years after the first mortal kombat film, fans couldn't wait for Annihilation to come out. Unfortunately, the sequel did not do well at the box office and after viewing it, I can see why. First, I will start with what is positive about the movie. Kitana had more of a role as did Jax, I preferred Sandra Hess as Sonya a little over Bridget Wilson even though she did a good job with Sonya's character in the first movie, some of the fight scenes (Jax vs. Cyrax, Sonya vs. Mileena, Liu Kang vs. Baraka, Sub-Zero vs. Scorpion) were sequenced good, the dvd bonus features were nice, and the soundtrack was awesome. These positive aspects, however, could not save the overall film from disappointment. So what went wrong? Like the first MK, Annihilation attempted to blend two mortal kombat games into one movie (mortal kombat 3 and ultimate mortal kombat 3). Unlike the first MK, however, the blend was not successful. Too many characters were put into the movie and therefore the character development for most of them was almost non-existent. Aside from that, only three of the actors to my knowledge returned from the previous movie though it is understandable why the other actors did not return. What else went wrong with this sequel? Some of the acting was either over-the-top and/or downright pitiful. Shao Kahn's character along with Raiden's character was poorly resembled. Also, some of the characters didn't even get much screen time at all. One flaw that is immediately noticed at the beginning of the movie is that one of the main characters gets killed off (I won't say who because it is probably obvious). While some of the fight sequences were good, most of them were rushed and some were just flat-out ridiculous. This goes double for the animality sequence. Sadly, MK Annihilation doesn't rank up with the first one. Despite all this, there is some good news. After eight long years of waiting, a third mortal kombat film will hit the big screen with most of the actors returning from the first movie. Plus, the third installment will not only kontinue where the first left off but will also ignore the events of Annihilation 
 This book was easy enough to read, it just wasn't what I expected from Quindlen.  I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.  The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.  Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.  The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young "sew-your-wild-oats" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the "perfect" father. I just did not find such an occurrence likely.  And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm. Anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me, and a disappointment especially since I have been a Quindlen fan for many, many years 
 Not a single screw, bolt, allan wrench, etc. enclosed with this desk.  The wood looked nice but getting it back into the box to return was like unscrambling an egg.  Hopefully UPS will pick it up although I've been waiting for more than a day now.  Amazon is paying for the return and that's a good thing 
      I had high hopes for this book since I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud while reading Bryson's 'In a Sunburned Country'. I was more than a little disappointed after finished `Lost Continent' I came away feeling more than a little disappointed.      Before I bought this book I was puzzled at the contrasting reviews here and I initially took the most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I figured these were written by people who mostly just took offense way too easily and were unable to laugh at themselves as Americans. I have to say though, after reading the book I find myself agreeing with some of the negative reviews of this book.       First off, as an American that has lived overseas for 3 years now, I feel I'm more than capable of looking at America with an objective eye. I'm completely aware of America's many shortcomings - ie.  the propensity for urban sprawl, the seemingly declining interest in it's rich history, the ever growing dependence on technology and increasing laziness that invariably comes with it etc. etc.     Having said that, I still regard this book primarily as just one endless, tiring, repetitive rant by an unhappy man. One would be hard pressed to find more than a couple instances where Bryson spent more than three of four sentences at a time describing anything he found ENJOYABLE. As one reviewer pointed out, Bryson comes across as being exactly like the kind of people he constantly complains about in this book...rude, ignorant, and, just like Bryson himself, overweight (apparently he hasn't stepped in front of a mirror lately). One has to wonder why someone would put out a book that is so consistently sour in tone. If I had just finished such a thoroughly unsatisfying and unhappy trek as this, I would be hard pressed to come up with a good reason (other than a quick buck perhaps) to actually write a book about it. Let me get one thing straight, if this were a book about Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. I would feel the same way. Yes, there are a few funny passages in his book, but his air of superiority along with the overuse of metaphors pretty much dampen it at times. As demonstrated in `In a Sunburned Country', his strength lies in sharing facts and history of the places he finds himself in, and the humor is always much more engaging when it isn't over the top and written as if he's trying to impress himself.        There was a span of about 12 years between the writing of `Lost Continent' and `In a Sunburned Country', and it shows. This is a younger Bryson, a man who seems to have a problem with every little detail, and it becomes increasingly tedious and irritating as the book goes on. He rarely displays anything other than contempt for the places he finds himself in. A couple of other reviewers also made valid points when they found it curious that (with the exception of his Iowa drug buddy) he never manages to engage anyone in anything resembling a meaningful conversation to actually get a handle on their mindset (as he did in "In A Sunburned Country' for instance). His interactions with locals are mostly limited to ordering food at local restaurants and asking for directions. He seems perfectly content coming to conclusions about entire groups of people based on no real substance and communication whatsoever.       In this book, sadly, he comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic, anti-social loner with a bone to pick with just about everyone and everything. Any remotely kind words he has about anything (and they are few and far between) are all but smothered by the sour tone of the book as a whole. I SO wish I could recommend this book for others to read, but I'd be lying if I said it's time well spent 
 I bought a set of four Westinghouse intercoms.  Usually people buy intercoms because they have a large house and don't want to have to trapes all over it to communicate with other people.  These Westinghouse intercoms (and I believe the same goes for the NOVI intercoms) require that all itercoms be on the same electrical circuit (that is, controlled by the same electrical breaker).  So, if your kitchen, family room, master bedroom, and garage outlets are on different breakers in your main electrical control panel and you want to set up an intercom system, the Westinghouse system will not work for you.  Intercoms are usually for large houses...large houses usually have more than one electrical circuit for outlets...hence, this product likely will not work for most people.  I replaced the Westinghouse intercom system with one by another manufacturer called the WireFree Intercom Reporter...this is a four channel system and it works great...works either with batteries or transformer...it is independent of the electrical circuits 
 I think that Cole is trying to explain something big here. The book tackles a lot of big subjects under the heading of "nothing" and tries to prove that what Cole refers to as "nothing" is really where everything in the universe comes from. And I think it really hits the mark sometimes. But 95% of the book is semantics and wordplay. And I think the book really stretches to fit some things into the "nothing is everything" theory. You'll wait at least 50 pages before you start learning real science. It must have been fun for Cole to play with the idea of nothing in riddle-like prose, but it really takes away from the science of the book. I say skip to the bibliography and read the books cited. They may be more concise 
 Let's try to imagine something you'd want to learn from your Southern Spain guidebook once you get there. How to pronounce Spanish? Sorry, the glossary in the back has no pronunciation guide, just glosses every word in the Spanish spelling. Oddly enough, although they don't tell you how to pronounce each letter, they tell you how each is spelled in the Spanish language.  Hmm, what else? Whether or not to tip your taxi-driver on the way home from the airport? Nope, sorry. There are two entries on taxicabs, neither of which mention that you don't tip.  Siestas? Southern Spain is full of siestas. They have them every day. The times vary between regions, though, and you should really know when they are because you won't be able to access food or drink or some attractions during the siesta. This book doesn't mention them. AT ALL. This is an appalling omission.  The maps for the various cities aren't even a page big, making them utterly useless. The book itself, because it is inexplicably printed on heavy glossy paper (this book is really into the fact that it has several full-page photo spreads to help you get 'into the mood,'), weighs more than anything else I brought with me on vacation. It was so heavy that I had to ditch it on a day-long trip to Granada. Needless to say, it was not missed.  If you buy this book, you're an idiot 
 I must admit disappointment with this book.  I bought this book out of hope, and have been left disillusioned at the future of seidhr if individuals like Blain are at the reins.  She admits to being "both a researcher and a practitioner" yet offers no proof of either point.  In fact, the author at every turn refuses to define seidhr at all.  Even openly admitting that it is her point to "avoid(s) definition" (page 146).  Why then, I must ask, write a book on "Seid-Magic" that is not about seidhr at all?  It seems the author's only contact with seidhr in any meaningful capacity is through Hrafnar, which is Diana Paxons' group in California.  This self-proclaimed "religious community", who practices and teaches "oracular seidhr" is squarely based in Umbanda voodoo (ref: Blain's book, page 66; and further acknowledged at the Hrafnar website).  As to how this constitutes seidhr is beyond this reviewer's comprehension.  What the reader will find here is a great deal of nothing regarding the rich mythology of esoteric heathenry and how it applies today.  Seemingly to taunt the reader further, Blain references the imput of Saami shamans without any substance to how their influence may relate to modern-day seidhr workers.  Nor is she able to adequately explain ergi in anyway that has not already been said to redundancy.  Finally, while citing several Sagas, she never examines them indepth, missing an opportunity to lend her alleged research and practice any credence.  The only value found in this book is the bibliography.   
 This book gets one star because you can't give zero. I have a B.A. in European History and I am utterly horrified by the historical inaccuracies in this series. As examples taken at random (there are lots, lots more of them): in Book One, Bauer describes Alcibiades as betraying Athens and leading an army into the city. Utterly incorrect. She admits she moved Boudicca's revolt until a later date in order to show that the Roman Empire was breaking down. Hello, you can't move historic dates in order to "prove" a hypothesis. In book Two, in her description of Justinian's rise to Emperor she basically says that he left the farm, studied hard and was chosen emperor. In point of fact, his uncle was emperor. Her historical errors go on and on. The author evidently didn't even bother to check her "facts" against something as simple as wikipedia. Bauer, according to her cover blurb, is a novelist and journalist with no apparent academic training in history, and, boy, does that lack of academic training show. She writes appealing journalistic hyperbole but doesn't bother to back her breezy simplifications with historical facts. Bauer also has a strong religous agenda. I'm a Christian myself but find the presentation of bible stories as historical events offensive. Anyone using this book to teach history to their child is doing their child a vast disservice. 
 I watch John Edward any chance I get on t.v. and gain so much comfort that the life energy does not end but transform.  The ending of this book was the most disappointing thing for me.  All of a suddent the character "crossed over" and there was everyone who had gone before him, even his childhood dog...like they had all been sitting around in some giant living room in their funeral clothes waiting... everything was just the same as in life, only somewhere else.  Maybe I was looking for a revelation and I was willing to stretch for it too...but then the ending was very clear and unsatisfactory. There seeem to be many people who loved the book and I'm glad they got something from it but I was disappointed...but only by the book...not John's work 
 This is one of these books that I would love to pretend to have read and enjoyed. Alas, pretending is not my forte. I would read this book only if I were forced to. Try the Christopher Vogler version instead 
 Don't waste your money on this book. It has ridiculous errors on almost every page that any fan is going to recognize immediately. It's like a book someone would write about a subject they have no real interest in just for money. Don't contribute 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 The New, Unbiblical Teaching  The idea that Christians can be possessed or "demonized" or have a demon indwell them is a relatively new development in Christian theology.  I have read books on the subject advocating this view, but none were as seemingly scholarly and well reasoned as Dr. Dickason's book.  This fact, however, makes the thesis of this book all the more dangerous.  Dr. Dickason seems to be a well-educated man with a Ph.D. from the evangelical Dallas Seminary.  But educated men have been wrong before, and such is the case for Dr. Dickason in this more erudite attempt to argue that genuine Christians can be demonized.    Exchanging Biblical Truth for Clinical Experiences  The central flaw in Dr. Dickason's approach to the topic is how he arrived at his conclusion, and how this conclusion influenced his reading of, and disregard for, the Bible.  Did the Bible teach him that Christians can be inhabited by demons, or did the Bible PLUS something else teach him this?     After analyzing 21 passages in the Bible in chapter 7 "Biblical Evidence Supporting Demonization of Christians," Dr. Dickason himself came to the conclusion that every one of them did not prove conclusively and without reasonable doubt that Christians could be demonized.  Dr. Dickason said on page 127: "Thus we cannot conclusively say that the Bible clearly presents evidence that believers may be demonized."  So if the Bible doesn't say Christians can be demonized, where does he get this idea?  Let's have a look.  After rationalizing away a number of passages which clearly show that God indwells the believer and is "greater" than satan and demons outside of believers (in chapter 6 "Biblical Evidence Against Demonization of Christians"), we find that Dr. Dickason easily comes to the conclusion in chapter 7 that, "The Bible does not evidence that believers cannot be demonized.  Thus we are left to look for other types of evidence that may contribute to answer our question: Can genuine believers be demonized?" (p. 127).  The flaw in Dr. Dickason's reasoning is evident in that he had to misinterpret certain passages in such a way that they could not destroy his thesis that was ultimately based on "clinical evidence," not the Bible.  He assumes that because the Bible is not clear in his mind, then this must mean the Bible is not clear.  This kind of reasoning is flawed and is called non sequitur.   For example, are we to assume that because Genesis 2:24 only directly says that a "man" leaves his father and mother and is joined with his wife in marriage, that this must mean that a "woman" does not leave her father and mother to be joined with her husband in marriage?  There is such a thing as axiomatic truth or implied truth.  If a man must leave his father and mother to be joined to his wife in marriage, it is obvious that the woman must also do the same.  We don't need explicit statements to realize this.    The same is true regarding the issue of demonization of Christians.  If the Spirit of God indwells believers as Scripture teaches (1 John 4:4; John 14:17; Romans 8:10; 1 Corinthians 3:16;  6:17), then it stands to reason that the same Spirit would not allow the darkness of demons to invade the Light of God illuminating the spirits of His followers.  If this same Spirit IN believers is "greater" than those outside of them who are out in the world (which must include satan and demons), then it stands to reason that their power cannot overpower the Spirit of God.    Can God be Demonized?    What Dr. Dickason and others do not realize is that in teaching that Christians can be demonized, they have unwittingly advocated the ridiculous and theologically bankrupt notion that God Himself can be demonized. How so?  Because if the believer is "one spirit" with God's Spirit as it says in 1 Corinthians 6:17, then it means that in order for a demon to enter a believer it must ALSO enter and demonize God's Spirit.  Now how crazy does that sound?  Obviously, Dr. Dickason and others have not thought through the spiritual implications of what they teach.  Experience No Indicator of Truth  Since the Bible is deemed "inconclusive" to settle the question of whether or not Christians can be demonized, Dr. Dickason thinks that clinical experience with people who seem to have been genuine Christians who were demonized must be the final court of arbitration.  But he fails to realize the inherent dangers of using an approach that uses the Bible plus experience.  This can be viewed as the sin of adding to God's Word (Proverbs 30:6).    To illustrate Dr. Dickason's fallacy, let's look at some Mormon theology.  Mormons believe that Jesus appeared in America sometime after His resurrection.  The Bible can be said to be "inconclusive" about this because there are no explicit statements for or against this notion.  Therefore, would Dr. Dickason be willing to argue with the Mormons that this validates trusting the experiences of Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon about Jesus appearing to native people in America?  Is this a Biblical way to arrive at truth?  As Thomas Ice and Robert Dean, Jr. remarked in their book on spiritual warfare called "A Holy Rebellion":  "The burden of proof lies with those who believe Christians can be demon possessed, since the Scriptures do not support that point of view.  Valid proof must flow from the Scriptures, not from experience." (p. 122, Harvest House Publ., 1990).  The Faulty Cancer Analogy  The fatal flaw in Dr. Dickason's reasoning in his book was when he tried to illustrate how we should answer the question of the demonization of Christians in the same manner as we answer the question of whether or not Christians can have cancer (pp. 154-160). But here Dickason fails to realize that he has committed the fallacy of a faulty analogy, since we cannot reasonably compare a living, sentient, spirit being (a demon) with genetic defects in human somatic cells that cause cancer.  Of course Dr. Dickason realizes this flaw but never addresses it in his book.    So there is no excuse for him not knowing the inherent weakness in such an analogy.  His flawed analogy also disregards the fact that the Bible makes clear that Christians can be afflicted with bodily sickness (1 Timothy 5:23; Acts 9:18), which is what cancer can be called.  But as he himself admits, the Bible does not support the idea that Christians can be demonized.  Conclusion:  In the final analysis, the greatest weakness in Dr. Dickason's thesis is revealed in this statement he made: "I have encountered...at least 400 cases of those who were genuine Christians who were also demonized...I would not claim infallible judgment, but I know the marks of a Christian and the marks of a demonized person.  I might have been wrong in a case or so, but I cannot conceive that I would be wrong in more than 400 cases." (p. 175).  To this I responded back in 1989 by writing on the title page of my copy of his book: "Anyone who believes that he cannot be greatly deceived, is already greatly deceived."    Has Dr. Dickason ever considered that maybe, just maybe, he was dealing with demonized UNBELIEVERS pretending to be  Christians?  This is not an unlikely scenario, especially in light of what the Bible says about false believers and pretenders (1 Tim. 4:1; 2 Tim. 3:13; 4:3,4; 2 Corin. 11:13-15).  This Biblical alternative was never addressed in the book.  But ultimately in all his clinical studies and the studies of others relying on flawed human discernment and ability, Dr. Dickason forgot to read 2 Timothy 2:19 and Matthew 13:28, 29.  Both of these teach that only God knows who among us are "genuine" Christians or not, because only God knows the heart.    Those who teach or believe that Christians can be demonized, based on books like this or "deliverance" experiences, have to realize that this is not a Biblical doctrine.  It is a false doctrine based on misreadings of certain Bible passages and overemphasis on flawed clinical studies by people who apparently think they have discernment abilities that Scripture says only God has.    Christian readers of this book are cautioned not to take what Dickason and others say at face value, especially when he himself admits that the Bible does not support his position.  If you've read this book or plan to read it, please make sure that you also read "A Holy Rebellion: Strategy for Spiritual Warfare" by Thomas Ice and Robert Dean, Jr.    Thus I end this review with these appropriate words from  Ice and Dean on the subject: "Since the Holy Spirit lives in the house of a believer, then every time a demon knocks at the door the Holy Spirit answers."    Edited/added comments:  Those who would attempt to justify the thesis of this book from Scripture are hard pressed because not one says that Christians can be "demonized."  Nowhere in the Bible do we have Peter casting a demon from Paul, or James casting a demon from Mark.  The apostolic Church did not teach this doctrine and nor did they practice it.  Appeals to Luke 13:10-17 as evidence that a Christian can be demonized are weak for several reasons.  First, the term "spirit of infirmity" does not necessarily mean a literal "spirit" meaning a demonic spirit inhabiting a person. If I said someone had a "spirit of joy" that would not mean the person had a literal "spirit" being in her called "joy."    Second, the text itself shows that the woman did NOT have a demon "cast out" from her but that she was HEALED from her satanically caused physical sickness (infirmity).  No demons cried out and left the woman in that text.  She was simply healed.    And lastly, the phrase "daughter of Abraham" could simply be a synonym for a descendant of Abraham, as most scholars and theologians would point out.  In fact, Luke 19:9, written by the same author as Luke 13, gives indication that phrases like "son of Abraham" and "daughter of Abraham" refer to ethnic ancestry, not salvation status (notice here the salvation is separate from ethnicity)    Regardless of what this phrase means, it is clear from the context of Luke 13 that this is not an instance of a demonized believer but a possible believer who had a physical problem healed.    One of the main problems with trying to detect demons without Biblical guidelines is that we fall into error too easily.  Nowhere does the Bible indicate that voice changes are demonic. Having "super" strength and "super" knowledge are biblical indicators because they can't be faked or easily produced by regular humans who are not demonized.  And needless to say, as I've already pointed out above, only GOD knows who truly is a Christian and who is not.  People saying they are Christians doesn't prove it.  The book I reviewed is well written and argued, but it fails to prove its point because of the many unbiblical assumptions made, and those who would try to support this book also fall into the same errors as Mr. Dickason.   
 Before I started reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.  Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In "Zen" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s. But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.  The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17:      "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower."  That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of "quality."   I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.   Whatever the book was supposed to be, it didn't impressed me.  
 Boring and dumb.  Mario Puzo's Estate must owe a lot of taxes to have licensed the use of Godfather characters.  
 Flipping through this book can be kind of fun in very, very small doses.  You get to read about some well known classic songs, some lesser known ones, and get reminded of some you might not have though of in years and be introduced to some you may have never heard.  But boy, what an ego Marsh has, and what arrogance!  I mean think about it.  Do you really think that anybody would buy and read a book by you about YOUR favorite songs 
 I think the Annie Dillard name is the sole reason for this "book" being published.  I write the word "book" in quotes because to call this a book is more than a bit of a stretch.  To me it reads like an old, senile person rambling nearly incoherently about things her mind has lost the ability to grasp for longer than a sentence or two.  I can see only one very general theme come out of this - that people are a product of the earth.  Why does it take 200+ pages to relate that no-longer-new theme?  And relating the theme is all the book does - no explanation, no analysis of the theme, nothing beyond merely stating it in a very long-winded and oblique way.  I hate to be so critical of this work, but I hope to save others the trouble of buying and reading this incoherent mess.  
 Easy to see why this book didn't sell very well. Sorry, guys, but the kids in the Metallica t-shirts really did it. No, dem 'der hicks in Arkansas weren't just looking for innocent teenagers to execute 
 Since I listened to this as a cd it is difficult to comment on the book as Tony Roberts performance was so bad, it was impossible to follow the story line.  He read so slowly that it seems he received a bonus if he could stretch this little book into 7 excruciating cds which he did.  In addition to the slooooow reading, his characterization were completely over the top.  Dino sounded like a moron and "Billy Bob" well like a Texas moron.  And what about Billy Bob, that cliche name eptomized the whole weak little story.  Skip this this one or prepare to suffer 
 This knife was dull upon receipt.  I sent it back...although I loved the handle shape and color 
 I have been a fan of Sue Henry since her first Jessie Arnold mystery.  I was looking forward to reading her lastest adventure, but was very disappointed in this outing.  The characters were one-dimensional.  After discovering who the "bad guys" were I needed to reread part of the book for clarification.  Sue Henry has a very annoying habit of foreshadowing at the end of many of her chapters.  "...they hadn't a notion just how decidedly things could - and would - change in the next few hours."  Even the relationship between Alex and Jessie seemed stilted.  I realize it is difficult to create plausible mysteries for a civilian like musher Jessie Arnold, but this book tried too hard and accomplished too little 
 I should have read the other reviews before I purchased this one. I not only wasted my time, but my MONEY ordering this book.  The book is written from a sarcastic view point about everything.  Nothing of substance.  I be sure to stay clear of future Dave Barry books.    Don't waste your time on this one!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I thought that this book was very harsh and critical of some groups of people.  I thought that it was quite insulting to men and whites.  I thought it was well writtten, and i loved the first couple sections about  Walker's ideas of activism rooted in love, but i found that as the book  progressed it seemed to become more of a praise of certain kinds of people  rather than praising all people and loving all people like it was claimed  earlier in the book.  Overall, Walker had good ideas, I just found that  sometime they were expressed in a manner of insult 
 24-Hour Party People is a mocumentary at the lowest rung (if Best In Show was not enough) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste. The British scene in the 1980's was influential and at the height of the 2nd Brit wave, and Michael Winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way.   My main issue with this film was it's attempts at being funny in a hip-Britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious. The dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway, and the film never really follows it's premise as much as it should: the rise of Factory. I did really enjoy the Joy Division segments, though, even if exploiting Ian Curtis's death was slightly in poor taste.   Unless you're a fan of the Brit explosion of the post-punk era, and an extreme fan at that, I could not recommend this film. It's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into. 
 If I knew, at the time I saw this movie, that a lot of theaters give back refunds...I sure would have gotten one.  At least the popcorn was good!  Since I love Adrien Brody, I will give him another chance......This movie was nuts.  Skipping between scenes, you really had to be on your toes to figure out what in the world was happening.  
 Is this book scientific or dogma? Science employs unambiguous concepts, does not ignore data that contradicts; and revises in the light of valid critique. This book fails all these tests. For a comprehensive critique of its many flaws see Professor Brendan. McSweeney's widely cited paper in Human Relations  (2002) 55.1. To take an example from the Hofstede's book: they state that "the masculinity-femininity dimension affects ways of handling industrial conflicts. In the United States as well as in other masculine cultures such as Britain and Ireland) there is a feeling that conflicts should be resolved by a good fight ... the industrial relations scenes in these countries is marked by such fights. If possible management tries to avoid having to deal with labor unions at all." (p.143). This claim first appeared in Hofstede (1991) and later in Hofstede (2001). Test 1: a national culture does not affect national managers but only national labor. Inconsistent. Test 2: according to the Hofstede's own ranking (p. 121) Japan is the second most masculine country and Germany is more masculine than either the US or Britain. And yet for over fifty years the industrial relations in Japan and Germany have been the least conflictful. The Hofstede's claim is contradicted even by their own data. Test 3: In 2002 McSweeney published a second paper in which he showed that mascluninity-femininity has no predictive or explanatory power in relation to industrial relations. His data showed that sometimes such relations in feminine countries are more aggressive than in masculine countries, sometimes they are less. Despite this data the Hofstede's repeat a claim that is clearly contradicted by the data (others and even their own). A company which believed the Hofstede's claim would be discouraged from considering investing in Britain, Ireland, or the US and would be encouraged to invest in feminine countries such as the Hofstede's Netherlands which they claim is the third most feminine country in the world. Hopefully, not too many are misled by the dogma in this book which bears no relation to reality 
 does anyone know the title or artist or both of the song that was playing in the background when wil approached eva in the club?  sounds like "everything but the girl" but i'm not sure.  the soundtrack doesn't have it...help!  thank 
 After reading some of Connie Willis' other books, I must say that this book was very disappointing to me.  After finishing this book it didn't even enter my mind once like Doomsday Book and Bellwether did.  It was very confusing and it didn't seem like the plot was going anywhere.  Like another reviewer said, I didn't know that Fin was female until almost the end of the book.  The reason that this isn't just one star is that the book was funny, especially the character Bult so I could enjoy the book a little bit 
 I was terribly disappointed with this King release.  Could a creative writing student done better?  Perhaps.   It was by far the worst published work I've ever read.  It was unreadable.  Throughout the entire first chapter I waited for a plot to be formed.  The characters were choppy and the story went nowhere.  The book seemed to be published on his name alone.  I have been disappointed in S. King  for some time now and this book really cemented my idea that he has lost his touch.  I am a long time fan, I began reading him in 8th grade and the last good book I read, written by him, was Hearts In Atlantis.  
 The set contains four discs. They are 2-sided discs, which means that stories are on both sides of each disc. But the stories are not very good. When watching any one of the stories, one wishes that the story would hurry up and end. A few of the stories are interesting or even clever, but something seems to be missing or wrong.   What is it that is wrong? Lack of plot development. In all of the stories, a significant portion of the script is arbitrary and could easily have been edited away. The stories flounder about due to lack of direction and focus. What we find in most of the stories is characters moving from one room to another, then back to the first room, then to another room, then rushing back to the first room. Or what we find is walking out to the garage, then to an automobile, then back to the garage, then back to the automobile. Or running away from a road and over a hill, then over another hill, then running back to the road. Most of the Outer Limits stories use great quantities of time where the characters move from here to there, and back again, with no purpose, and little relevance to supporting the plot. And then there are the rubber masks. The Outer Limits series should properly be re-named, "Rubber Mask of the Week Show."   The Outer Limits stories are, in a word, mediocre. I tossed my four Outer Limits discs in the trash. Is there anything good that I can say about the Outer Limits discs? Yes! It was somewhat fun cracking each of the discs in half, ripping up the plastic case, and chucking them out.   If you want some good stories to watch, I would recommend buying a dozen or so of the Twilight Zone discs (especially volumes 2, 3, 8, 9, 11, 26, and 39). For people who like color TV shows, I would also recommend buying a season of the X-Files. For these interested in some early black and white science fiction movies, I would recommend the set discs containing most of the early Ray Harryhausen films. And then, of course, there is the classic The Day The Earth Stood Still. 
 oh baby, this is precious, someone here is actually comparing CMB to The Beatles?!?! Is that why CMB's CD is selling for a whopping 21 cents? I'd love to continue but the urge for uncontrollable laughter is just way too much, ha ha ha ha ha ha......... 
 I regret this purchase.  As one reviewer said, this is just a coffetable book. It doesnt introduce any new idea to an educated woman. Who cant roll a napkin and tie a ribbon on it ??? It doesnt take a professional caterer to know that !!!  Funny, but an out of print 1960's cookbook by Mary and Vincent Price ``A Treasury.....'' showed far more intricate, elegant, and exquisite napkin foldings. The utensils showed in Tabletops are not even for very dining ! Worse, an old item was made to pass off as an antique centerpiece and I am a professional antique collector. I lived in Europe and this book does not deserve space in any European home or library. What I saw here, I see frequently in crafts store windows in small towns.  DONT BUY. I got instead ``Perfect Setting'' by Peri Wolfman (?) and finally, I got something intelligent with truly new ideas to captivate an intelligent woman. At best, give this book to a grade school kid 
 Birch once again gives us more information about herself than is needed.  Check out Donna Farhi's "Yoga: Mind, Body and Spirit" for a more thorough examination of the subject matter without all of the self-important jibber-jabber 
 This movie is being promoted in its trailer and on its website as having something to do with the BDSM and consensual Master/slave relationships practiced by some in this community. In fact it is a piece of total BS that is about kidnapping women, selling them, killing them and selling their body parts. The plot makes no sense. All the details about such relationships are wrong. The presentation of "training" and its results are laughable. If you want to watch a couple of naked women running around and being treated like dogs for part of the movie, then it may be worthwhile, but unlike the opinion of some others here, this movie has nothing to do with anything that happens in the real world. And the acting, editing, etc. are not even B movie quality 
 Like the fact that Saddam committed genocide attempts in his mass murder of Iraqi Kurds in the 1980's (during his Anfal campaign). Brigham mentions Saddam's invasion of Kuwait distinctly enough but that was one of Saddam's secondary crimes compared to his dreaded Anfal Campaign 
 well im 16 [writing kids review because i dont have my own amazon account] and when i first got my pink razr from verizon wireless i loved it especially because its pink, but now that ive had it for 2 months or so im not so fond of it. first off, it takes about eight seconds to clear to the home screen, and that takes forever, the phone in general is slow. also theres an obnoxious buzzing in the earpiece. Im stuck with this phone for a while, and am not to happy with it 
 Michel Murray shows a distinct lack of knowledge of pathophysiology (alteration of body function due to disease). He fails to present balanced reviews of the literature on herbal supplementation leaving out well conducted studies which failed to show the benefits promoted in his book. Often his conclusions are based on opinion instead of scientific evidence.  Save your money and buy some other work of fiction. - William Joppa R.Ph., B.S.

  I've really enjoyed the other things that I've read by Franzen (The Corrections; How to Be Alone, a book of essays), but I found "The Twenty Seventh City" to be nearly unreadable. The only reason that I persevered to the end was that I was stuck on a 6-hour cross-country flight with nothing else to read. As it was, I wound up skimming the last 100 pages.   Two of the biggest problems with this book are an overabundance of minor characters and a very choppy narrative, in which the average scence is about 1 to 2 pages. It's just jump after jump after jump for 500 pages, with no sustained development of anything. I also found the basic premise (a police colonel and cousin of Indira Ghandi from India comes to the US to take over the police force of St. Louis, where she uses a band of Indian terrorists to manipulate the city's business and political elite and control the real estate market) so implausible that it was just a constant stumbling block all though the book. None of the characters struck me as remotely believable or interesting. I suppose it was intended as some sort of farce, but I don't think I encountered a single thing that I thought was humorous. Then there is the dialect... rather than developing distinctive characters, the author writes in truly awful dialect (eg, a character who says things like "Habout time" or "Hanyway"; and of course, a police officer with a lisp).   Altogether, this may be most excruciating piece of fiction writing I've read in the last 5 years. 
 Douglas as Van Gogh was a reincarnation of the artist himself. Van Gogh was an eccentric and tormented soul.  Douglas manifested all the elements needed to descibe and fullfill the artist's message.  Like all the great artists, Modiliani, Gauguin and Van Gogh were haunted by the demons of their past, which inevitably lead to their self destruction.  An excellent film to all, not just art historians 
 I read this book, and I must say, it seems that the only thing she likes is Pantene, and other like products. On every other page there is a reference to a product, but how Pantene is better. Are you kidding me!!!! Yuck! I think she seriously got paid off on this one. Cover to cover advertisements for a damaging horrrible product 
 While the author is certainly knowledgable, the tone of the book is decidedly pedantic and offensive. He lumps all free trade skeptics together, from GreenPeace to Pat Buchanan, from Joe Stiglitz to Chairman Mao. And even throws Al-Qaeda in for good measure. People opposed to market worship "fall rather into the category of spoiled children" who are blissfully ignorant of reality. This is the starting point of the book, and this attitude continues throughout.  If you want to reinforce your market-oriented convictions, and have a tremendously belittling view of people who don't agree with you, you will love this book. If you want a measured, unbiased and well-reasoned discussion, keep looking 
 I bought the RIGHT edition and then sent me the WRONG ONE! 
 Glad I just recorded this from TV, because boredom set in fairly quickly and then I just fast forwarded, and saw the ending. It's now erased. Life is too short to sit through junk like this 
 There more than enough interesting material here for a good book. Reading this is like following a dozen rabbit trails without a guide. Even knowing the point of the essay before-hand only carried me so far. These authors needed more interested editors 
 The Comancheros follows the typical early John Wayne western formula, a big bawdy rollicking western full of colorful good old boy western characters. Unfortunately that formula also includes a severely fractured, incoherent plot, a rambling-babbling pointless story, factual errors, and Native Americans portrayed by Caucasians and stereotyped as inhuman idiots and drunks. The Comancheros starts out with John Wayne, a Texas Ranger, apprehending Stuart Whitman (Regret) somewhere between New Orleans and Texas (but looks a lot like Utah or Arizona). It seems as though the point of the story will be the return of Whitman (Regret) to Louisiana to stand trial for murder, but that initial plot is long forgotten about halfway through the movie when The Comancheros takes on multiple, disjointed and disconnected subplots, pointless fight scenes, and aimless shootouts with indians that have little or nothing to do with the original theme established in the movie's opening scenes. The best thing about The Comancheros is the stirring opening theme music by Elmer Bernstein. John Wayne's best western is the Cowboys, take time to watch it instead of the god awful Comancheros 
 Not at all informative, this book seems to have taken its cue from Huntington's "Clash of Civilizations" theory: the authors construct a model for the future U.S.-China confrontation that they almost  seem to hope will come about. Although nestled in scholarly language and  presented as the views of experts on China, most of the argument seems  based more on stereotypes and American paranoia than any actual fact. Also  annoying is the authors' assumption of the general benignity of U.S. policy  in Asia; it never occurs to them to question the designs of U.S.  policy-makers and businesses in the region.. 
 I made the mistake of buying this cd for one song basically. I would have saved some money had I just burn the one song that I like. The songs just really do not seem to flow very well together. There is too much down time between songs and too much talking. "Get Busy" is definetly the best song on the cd. I will admit I listen to it over and over and do not get tired of it. However, his newest cd "The Trinity" is much better. 
 I was hoping there would be some new info in this book, but there was none. ZIP!!! I still find it interesting that after running a stop sign and killing an innocent driver, that she still has NO comments. None of her friends think it was "a big deal" - that they all just "moved on."  Moved where? In the State of Washington she would be charged with vehicular homicide. It's a serious charge here. I can't help but wonder had it been Hilary Clinton, what the thoughts would be. Lots of reference to her "sorority sisters" - which was annoying. But in a way it helped me to understand exactly where she came from and why she is the way she is today. Don't buy this book 
 This "nifty" piece of machinery was the one choice at my local store and so, I got it. I really wanted to get the Air-O-Swiss one but alas, it cannot be found or shipped to Canada... weirdly.  So far, I am less than impressed. Took me forever to even get it working. The constant resetting is tiring. I did find a solution (initial anyway) - you fill the tank but also fill the inside reservoir (where the round filter is) and then it works.  The noise it makes is NOT easy to get used to, no matter how tired you are.  I am trying it for one night, then if I can't sleep I will return it. It's not worth the money. My advice? Save up and get the Air-O-Swiss 
 Ohh, Please!!   This is all about Barme, whom most iod these dissidents whom he at turns fetishizes and disparages themselves hate.   Idiots like Barme just cant stand the fact that many, nay most Chinese do not hate Mao,  their "system", etc etc.. Why in God name does Barme et al want  China to be just like, say, the US or Australia??   Anecdotes are not  arguments, GB 
 I'm glad this movie didn't cost me too much. Why? Because it was bad? No, the movie was O.K. but it was like every other Euro-movie with one "name" American star set somewhere in Europe. Who knows, maybe it played better over there. For Mickey Rourke completionists only 
 After reading all the good reviews on this book I decided it must be worth reading.  While I agree that there are alot of problems with watching television the arguements he gave were insane.  Half of the book didn't appear to have anything to do with television.  He blames things such as people commiting crimes and mental health problems to watching television.  He also said something about people substituting telelvision light for real, natural light.  He also talks about evolution and, as a christian, I don't buy into that and don't want to read a book that teaches that as a fact.  It's definately a book that I wouldn't recommend to anyone 
 I have read the government issued publication and this commerical version and I do not see why anyone would buy this version. Download the real copy and save your money. The team that wrote the book did an awesome job. The real free version is a must for any serious student of CB warfare. 
 Inticing beginning, but quickly drops off into the most DULL details of useless information.  Even the ending was dull and in my opinion, and unfinished 
 I don't really know what was worse about this book, the ridiculous plot or the ethnic stereotypes.  Skip it and watch some grass grow instead, if you're that bored 
 The Kite Runner gets off to such a good start, with its blend of history, observations about daily life in Kaboul, and a compelling story of two boys growing up together. The second half goes badly astray, as the novel becomes more and more manipulative and sentimental. By the end of the book, the author is willing to put his characters through all sorts of hell just so he can follow up with a teary reconciliation. I wish an editor had convinced him to tighten it up, stay focused, and resist the urge to tug at the heartstrings with such a heavy hand 
 Osborn's book is a cross between a criticism of the traditional Catholic Church and a liberal wish fulfillment of what he wants the Church to become.  It lacks any real drama or tension, and as some of the other reviewers note, the ending is utterly non-surprising.  The book partially roots itself in a real event wherein a group of liberal Catholics took out a full-page ad in the New York Times and challenged the Church hierarchy to engage in a dialogue over contraception, women priests, etc.  The Church shot it down, thus establishing the author's undercurrent that the Church is run by ignorant, tyrannical old men.  I find the book's premise that the only "good" Catholic people are those who are young and open-minded, (and conveniently American), and that dialogue and free-thought will solve everything.  If that's the case, then why is the book so one-sided?  As a case in point, early into the story, the main character has a litany of traditionally liberal Catholic questions: why is it wrong for a person to use contraception?  Why does the Church stand in the way of a woman's right to choose?  Osborn fails to present any sound theological justification for why the Church should change its view.  It simply revolves around a loose, American feeling of "This is the way I feel."  He forgets that if the Church is to maintain its identity as a holy institution founded by Jesus Christ for the purpose of bringing man back to God, then changes in Church philosophy need to be consistent with the core Church beliefs.  But instead of logic, theology, or serious debate, the novel is reduced to "the Church keeps me from doing what I want."  Where's the dialogue in that?  It's unsurprising, then, that the hero of the story is a young, American Cardinal whose background is from working with the poor, while the villain is an opulent European Cardinal portrayed as a gaunt and bitter old man with delusions of grandeur.  The book has no real engagement or question of Church philosophy, but a simple stark contrast of "young is good, old is bad."    To potential readers, I say this: there's better books out there, even those that criticize the Church.  (At least "The DaVinci Code" had a plot.)  If you're a non-Catholic who wants to learn more about the Church, even from a critical standpoint, I suggest reading The Catechism of the Catholic Church so you can learn what the Church's official teachings are and WHY they teach it (unlike Gregory's book here, which just mulls over what they teach without the reasons why) 
 I absolutely despise this stupid emocore band and the stupid people who cream themselves over it.  This is just like Fall Out Boy, UnderOath and the rest of those goons; its all whiny singing about the girl that dumped the malnourished singer, awful two-chord guitarring with no solos, inaudible bass lines, and monotinous drumming.  MCS has done nothing groundbreaking except tack on more s*** in the emo genre, keeping this abomination of music alive.  MCS is by no way heavy or hardcore, if you Motion' fans ever heard "Antichrist" by Sepultura, you'd all s*** your pants and run for cover because you can't stand heavy metal.  Hell, you'd all do the same thing if you listened to Black Flag, which makes this band look like Simple Plan.  In other words, this band is equally soft and weak as Simple Plan.  If you want real punk, listen to Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys.  If you want good music in general, listen to Sepultura (only with Max) and Slayer.  Death to Motion City Soundtrack and emocore!!   
 This book sorely disappointed me for two reasons. I strongly agree with the thesis of the title, that the media largely abandoned their important duty as watchdogs of democracy in the run-up to the War in Iraq, HOWEVER, this issue amounts to a grand total of ONE chapter in her entire book. The rest is a bunch of anecdotes tied loosely together. In fact, it reads more like an anthology than a unified work.   The second thing that disappointed me was also something of a shock: Helen Thomas, Grand Dame, Dean of the Washington Press Corps, is a lousy writer! I am serious. I read on average one or two political/nonfiction books a month, and this is one of the most poorly written I have read yet. Some of the books I have read are by "regular" people, some by pundits, and some by politicians. Nearly all of them write in a more interesting and engaging style than Mrs. Thomas. Her tone is often conversational at best, and her stories seem to be told as much to discuss presidents' interactions with the media as to tell you what an interesting career she has had.  I could not in good faith give it one star. It isn't horrible. It is just extremely disappointing 
 Could anyone tell me where's the plot of this book? In the first pages of the book you'll know who shut Andy and why, so the rest of the book is worthless because you know the truth and the police doesn't. How could this be a thriller? The book's plot could be written in 25 pages or less 
 All you need to know about this book is that Alston Chase has a vendetta against the Park Service.  Chase is correct that the Park Service's vision of, and policies for, Yellowstone have changed over time, and have  frequently been inconsistent, sometimes silly, and sometimes destructive.   But he doesn't grant any leniency for the fact that the earlier, most  destructive, policies occurred in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.   And after all, the Park Service is a government agency - who in their right  mind could be surprised that they've made mistakes?  Most important, he  damns both the early policy of active management and the present policy of  letting most things happen naturally.  It's clear that no action of the  Park Service could ever satisfy Chase, because he doesn't really know what  he wants.  Chase has no substantive alternative management policy to  propose - he's simply one of those annoying people (and we all know some of  them) who never have anything helpful to say but are always quick to  criticize 
 You can get a 4 pack of Emerging Power 2100 mAH batteries for 9.95 on this very site.   I did.  They work great.  Why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries.  Ridiculous 
 Marcuse has long been a favorite of intellectuals and for good reason - his ideas brought about the rise of the Left on college campuses and made acceptable the practice of allowing only acceptable views a hearing.  Dissenting opinions are to be silenced. His idea of societal/cultural Marxism seems slightly nutty and a tad romantic - one of those theories worked out by tenured professors over a second glass of brandy at the local pub. But Marcuse is anything but flippant - he is dead serious.  He is also a contradiction.  At once didactic (he's German)and eccentric, he also (like Freud) played the part of the gifted bourgeoise trapped amid a swill of nonentities. He has never refrained from advocating a dictatorship of the elite who would guide/help/force the stupid masses. For some reason, he thought undisciplined, nomadic students would lead that vanguard. And in a sense they did - by entering politics, academia or the media.  His disciples are classic "NPR" types - highly educated, white, well-heeled and immersed in political ideology.   One cannot underestimate his influence.  His theories led to several current movements (quote unquote): Deconstructionism, the Marxist interpretation of language, Political art, identity politics, group (gender/ethnic) over individual rights, the new Primitivism (radical environmentalism/animal rights) and last but not least, violence as an acceptable political response.    Despite the shrill denunciation of Western culture he chose to remain behind enemy lines, never venturing to Marxist lands for study where critical works of this kind would not be permitted. This is the paradox: Critical writers would not be allowed in a Marcusian society since "wrong" ideas are not permitted. Like Chomsky or Vidal or even the clownish Michael Moore, he walked among the very peoples he denounced.  The thesis of the book - typically Marxist - is the plight of the worker brought up to date by Marcuse.  We learn of the horrors of capitalism and the hope for a brighter future. But would his society of mind-numbing politicalization make individuals richer in spirit and more fulfilled?   One aspect of Marcuse I've always admired is his brutal honesty. Unlike other theorists he openly advocates violence when it is necessary to achieve a political goal.  He embraced the students who rioted in the 60's but unlike other letists he was never fooled by the common worker - they would never willingy accept his societal vision. He says (repeatedly) "They must be taught".  This work is very 1950sh, especially the parts with the outdated Freudian allusions.  It reads like a religious tract that quotes  ancient writings as the best answer for current problems. One must remember that this was written when Marxism was still taken seriously in some quarters.  Its effects remain with us today.   
 You know, I used to like Renny Harlin's films when I was younger, but they really don't hold up, I've realized with my coming of age. I think he's a talented director capable of some genuinely biting action scenes ('Cliffhanger', 'Die Hard 2'), but overall his films are messy, and, if I'm to be scholarly in articulating the matter, stupid.   For me 'Deep Blue Sea' has a few things going for it. One -- the beautiful Saffron Burrows, who I might add can actually act, doing at least what she can with the generally bankrupt dialogue. Plus, there's a laughably contrived scene which requires her to get half-naked; given I didn't care about much by the time this gloriously sleazy moment appeared, I can't say I wasn't all for it. Then, there's the uncommonly merciless attitude of the film; none of the characters are given sympathy, and I find that admirable and devoid of manipulation. I mean, Sam Jackson's fate... Female leads being chomped to pieces. In a film comically unrealistic (which I don't judge too harshly, for it is made on the primary premise of SUPER INTELLIGENT SHARKS), the nature of the miserable situation is played out with a welcome, sensible set of results. Oh, and I'd say that LL Cool J is surely the peak of the film's performances; I hate the guy when he's in that ultra suave, dripping sweat, buldging, chocolate Casanova, but his role here is near the antithesis of that; a goofy, Bible quoting cook, with an obnoxious bird (I can't imagine who's brain this abominable idea came from) and a past alcohol problem.   And then there's Harlin, who, like I said, certainly has a knack for creating some of the most awesomely thrilling action scenes among Hollywood's finest directors of the genre. But, in 'Deep Blue Sea', sad to say, there are only a small handful. Also of some note is the score by Trevor Rabin, which covers moods from heroically cheesy to atmospheric and eerie. I think this is especially commendable for Rabin because, by and large, this is a horror/thriller (the former a bit of a stretch), requiring him to maintain a good deal more restraint than has ever been requested of the composer.  When it's all said and done though, it's just not very good. I can understand why people would enjoy it, because it is mindless and has some redeeming features spawning from that sense of recklessness -- and surely, I'm not against this particular mentality in a film -- but it's just a bit too stupid and apathetic for me to care. I got it used for a bargain, but I'm not sure it was really worth even that. And, while I'm by no means ashamed of its existence within my library, I'm pretty confident I'll never sit through the entire thing again 
 I must agree with the previous reviewer, who found this CD 'lacking in grandeur'. The vocal performances and music are meticulously crafted and delivered, and may indeed be true to the spirit of the period in which they were written. But they are curiously lightweight, and I felt like I was listening to musical fluff. "Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring"--in my opinion, the most moving of all the cantatas--was far too fast-paced: it sounded distressingly like the Minute Waltz. "Sleepers Awake" received similar treatment. Professionally, all of the performers on this CD undoubtedly delivered, but what they delivered was curiously lacking in the soul-stirring majesty that Bach's cantatas can evoke 
 Note : Extra Content overview and final call at the end of review.  Many much like myself have enjoyed the laughter that many of Sealab moments have brought on through the course of it's few seasons. Such a great idea to resurrect a well aged cartoon targeted to kids and putting a new spin on it by voicing a great cast, aiming the content more upwards towards an adult audience with it's crude humor, unexpected antics and it's references to pop culture in such a small, but easily attention kept time frame, it was surely a refreshing thing to watch and well to the naysayers, if you didn't get it...you just didn't get it. Us fans sure did though.  Unfortunately there is a reason this was the last season, and even though with a heavy heart we end a "Legacy of Laughter", it was for the best to put her out of her misery before she made anymore suffer. The point is to put it plainly was this was the worst season of the series. Although I can appreciate the trial and error it was, simply it was dragged on through the mud and lost a lot of that genuine quick pop to noggin with it's slapstick humor was replaced with longer unfunny drawn out cracks and personal jokes that plagued the series with seeing more sharks, senseless violence, sharks, ill attempts to offend, and even more sharks. I even personally was let down when Michael started using his real voice for Tornado half way through the season and even though much of the character wasn't recieved well, the homage he was paying to his father and what he brought to the character voice wise was extremely well, unfortunately the writing wasn't top notch to let him really shine.  Some say that perhaps it was an inevitable thing that this show was going to crash down with the loss of the great voice talent that was Harry Goz playing Captain Murphy. Although nothing can replace that man and Murphy respectively, I still believe the actors burrowed on quite professionally, still doing a great job playing their parts and attempting to really salvage this show. Perhaps it was just too much too soon. Perhaps a break was needed rather to rush into more episodes, regardless of fanfare pushed towards them. I have to say the decision to end it was the right one...but I still anticipate we might see some sort of homage paid later in the future, let's just hope it's not tommorow guys. If anything can be said regardless of whichever season it was or any specific moment in time that would set off a series of events that would lead us to this point, it is that we can't take anything away from this show as a whole. It was a great show with some great smart humor, even if people thought otherwise and I would bet on it with whatever little money I have, that those who may have lambasted it, also were the ones silently standing in the back of the room, chuckling to themselves and thinking...well...now i get it.  Extra Content and DVD Packaging as a whole...  The package is very simple, slim and clean in a very nice keep case which is different from the other sets. Even better, I was surprised at the menu to be a compelling change, a half way serious pictorials of old time sea diagrams, it in itself was a refreshing change of pace and nice to see. Unfortunately the studio fails to deliver. They could have easily stuck with one disc instead of wasting expenses on two and upping the price (which in fair honestly, is repulsive compared to the quality and quantity). All that aside, this approach is nothing new. What's worst is the extra content on the disc. These are the only things you'll find, as much as it was searched, there were no easter eggs on either disc, unfortunately this is it.  Shrabster Forward - Completely the same as the Shrabster episode, expect put in chronicle order, which personally was more entertaining to me than the original. I suppose the writers thought it would be more funny to switch up the parts and add to chaos that the show was spiraling into anyways. I would say if you liked the episode to begin with, you'd likely like this better.  Legacy of Laughter (with alternate ending) - If I recall, this was pretty funny. I believe the alternate ending instead of shooting to the black and white font explanation of Sealab officially ending, it cut to an audience member asking what they would do now that Sealab has ended, Dr. Quinn repeats the question unsoundingly just finding this out for the first time and then it cuts to a video of one of the voice actors (although I don't recall who) in the studio during their session being informed that the show will be ending and him retorting in uproar that he just bought a house. It was actually pretty funny, but short.  Joy of Grief (deleted scenes) - Nothing really specially, you can see where they rehashed the other scenes, reusing jokes such as Stormy in the classroom saying Hesh's lines about when he woke with a roll of quarters in his you know where, which was different, but ultimately unfunnier than Hesh's version of the scene.  Sunken Treasures (Best of Sealab) - Hosted by the trees Matt Maple and Pat Poplar found on Happy Funtime Island in the episode of Isla de Chupacabra, this was 16-minute episode if you will, looking back at some of the best moments on Sealab 2021. Just as stated, it's some of the best moments, but leaves out a lot of the most funniest moments and drags on a bit too long, including all be it a little too much from this season. The banter between the hosts is occassionally funny, but nothing sound.  Nightshift - Pretty worthless in my opinion. A less humorous look not so much detailing to people who keep Sealab running, known as the Night Shift in their own episode. You'll get perhaps one or two chuckles out of this and although it's sort of nice to see more clips from the old show featuring characters you wouldn't normally see, the dialogue is funny and just resorts to them having trouble ordering pizza. Bore.  Overall, the extra content is lacking...they didn't even include commentaries on any episodes on this set...although that may be a good thing considering the riddiculously boring audio tracks they put over previous sets, they definately didn't go all out for this one...heck, I was even expecting some sort of ode to Harry Goz, considering there wasn't one on the previous, and that would have made it much better seeing some intimant moments with the real actor, but perhaps they just wanted to get this out and over with as quick as possible. The finaly call in my opinion is to pass on this set, even if you are a big fan. I'd rather try and catch some of the more funny episodes on the tube and record them from there than to shell out money for this overpriced set. I believe only hardcore, destined to must have every episode and extra feature pushed your sort of fans will only have a need to buy this (although i did enjoy several of the different versions of the main theme song at the end of many of the episodes). I'll never forget what joy this series brought me, but I am in no way rushed to get this set and complete the other three i own, unless it's an absolute steal...or free. Like I said, buyer beware 
 I came to this book with some high expectations only to be really dissapointed. The whole time I kept thinking that I was reading a Hardy Boys novel set in a "Thieves World" version of Stygia. When someone tries writing in the steps of another writer the bar is significantly raised. In Howard's "Hour of the Dragon" his single chapter in Stygia contained more atmosphere and horror then this novel could do in almost 300 pages. So bad I didn't even waste the time finishing it.  
 I can't believe the other reviewers read the same book I did! Early on, the author relates his method for dealing with his dogs after they've killed several chickens. He beats them, ties them up for days without food, hits them with chicken carcasses, and ties dead chickens around their necks until the chickens rot away.  And he tells this story as if it reflects well on his problem-solving ability. I know he was inexperienced at farming at the beginning of the story but you don't have to be especially bright to know that 1. Chickens who remove all the grass in their enclosure will make every effort to get to where the grass is greener.  2. Chickens are prey. 3. Dogs -- especially unneutered males -- have a strong prey drive. 4. Combine untrained, unneutered dogs with freely roaming chickens and it's bound to end in tears. The whole imbroglio is Stewart's fault but his response is to beat and torture the dogs into submission. (I was immensely relieved to learn that he has no children.) In his chapter on farm dogs, he prattles on ignorantly about how much they love being chained to a tree at night and their pleasure at living out of doors in all kinds of weather, while the reader grows increasingly depressed.   One can only be grateful that he concentrates on vegetables.  But no matter how great his veggies are, he's ignorant about and mean to the animals in his care. (Rather than my usual practice of giving old books to the library, I threw this book out. I wouldn't want to encourage anyone else to read it. 
 This cookbook received rave reviews and is from a world reknown hospital.  Sounded great but what a disappointment!  A handfull of recipes, nothing new or exciting or even inspiring. I felt I wasted my time and money on this one and returned it.  I would have given it 0 stars if that was an option 
 First, here are some general positives about Jaci Velasquez:  - She is a very gifted singer. Her vocal range is top-notch - definitely on par with Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera.  - She is beautiful. And unlike a previous reviewer, I do not consider the recognition of this attribute to be a sign of shallowness but rather a display of appreciation for feminine beauty. I like beautiful singing voices. I like beautiful women. There's no difference.  - She has great spiritual depth. Her music reflects key spiritual themes such as love, faith and joy.  Now, here's a critique of the CD:  I listened to all the music samples (as you can do as well) and only one song caught my attention - "Lay It Down". The other tracks have too much of a hard rock sound and were too experimental for my taste. But the song "Lay It Down" was different. It sounded more acoustic, more in the style of folk rock - a genre that reflects my personal preference in pop music.  I found the sound clip of "Lay It Down" to be intriguing because it reminded me of a hit song in the 1970's - Eric Carmen's "All By Myself", later covered by Celine Dion in 1996. "All By Myself" is a ballad having a soft, understated introductory verse with an explosive chorus. The sample clip of "Lay It Down" appears to be in the same mold. It has a soft, understated introductory verse; however, it seems to lack an explosive chorus.   Listen to the sample and hear it for yourself. The introductory verse is closing with the following lyrics:    "All of my hopes and my dreams and my best laid plans    Are slowly slipping through my folded hands"  So far, so good. There's only a piano and a violin accompanying Jaci's soft vocals. Next, the song appears to be moving from the verse to the chorus and you hear the following lyrics:    "So I'm gonna lay it down    I'm gonna learn to trust You now"  Now here's a problem. I am expecting to hear the beginning of an emotional outburst - an opportunity for a singer with the pipes of Jaci Velasquez to showcase her voice. But it is not forthcoming. Why?   This intrigued me and I wanted to hear the whole song but I did not want to purchase a CD for only one song. Luckily, I discovered that a compilation CD of Jaci Velasquez's best songs was released recently and it contained "Lay It Down". Great! I bought the CD - "On My Knees: The Best of Jaci Velasquez".   This is what I discovered after listening to "Lay It Down".  - The first time through the verse and the chorus, the song is definitely understated. We simply have the accompaninment of a piano and a violin with Jaci's soft vocals.  - The second time through the verse and the chorus, a drum beat is introduced and Jaci begins to let some emotion out beginning in the middle of the verse and when the song moves into the chorus a complete emotional outburst occurs. But somewhat to my dismay, this is not the same voice that I am expecting from Jaci Velasquez. Her voice was more raspy and raw (actually, it was sounding more like Demi Moore or Tara Reid, not that that is necessarily bad). Furthermore, she appeared to be struggling.  Is this the same voice that was soaring effortlessly through the stratosphere on songs such as "On My Knees", "Speak For Me", and "Adore"? Is Jaci Velasquez losing her voice?  I don't know but I find it very difficult to imagine that a young woman in her mid-20's is losing her voice. She is entering her prime. Barring a health issue, this just doesn't happen.  "Lay It Down" is actually a pretty good song. In fact, I am almost of the opinion that it may be her best. I certainly find myself listening to this song more than any of her others.  "Lay It Down" has the same message as the Beatles' classic "Let It Be". The words are different but both songs share the same sentiment. Actually, now that I think of it...they do share a couple of words in common...the words "let it be". Here are the closing lyrics:            "I'm gonna let it be, I'm gonna let it go            I'm gonna lay it down"  The essential lesson being conveyed is learning to "let go and let God" - a profound spiritual insight. Something that each of us here is learning.  This song is heartfelt and gut-wrenching. And though her voice is struggling through it, the song, nevertheless, works out its magic.   I gave this CD 2 stars because I think Jaci Velasquez is attempting to redefine her music style and has not succeeded. Interestingly enough, her best sound was her first CD - Un Lugar Celestial (A Heavenly Place). Bring back the spanish/flamenco guitar and develop a more acoustic sound. In my opinion, the acoustic sound is more spiritual. Keep the piano and electric bass guitar but dispense with the hard rock electric guitar and synthesized sound effects. Develop a Latin folk rock sound with an element of jazz. Hire a good saxophonist or a trumpet player. Emphasize ballads. That should do the trick 
 I was disapointed with the book.  It might be useful for a novice user, but it doesn't get into the detail which I was expecting.  I have been pleased with other Sybex books in the past, but this one probably won't make it on my reference shelf.  If you are an advanced user searching for a rather technical book, I would not recommend this book 
 I bought this item along with the bookcase and nightstand for my 8 year old.  It has made me rethink ever buying furniture that needs to be assembled again.  I spent my whole Sunday putting the thing together.  The knobs come apart very easily I have lost 4 so far.  I will just replace them they look cheap anyway.  You can see the metal casing through the glass.  You definately get what you pay for it is a cute dresser but its not worth the aggrevation.  The nightstand was a breeze and the bookshelf was better.  Plan about 4 hours for this project and expect to be disappointed.  
 I read this book as part of a book discussion group I had joined and it was so wretchedly lackluster it proved to be the death knell of me ever going back to the group. This book was half-baked, boring, and grievously devoid of even the tiniest bit of interest. I can't even give it credit for having any sort of vocabulary beyond the comprehension of an average twelve year old. The characters were so flat that I didn't even finish it. Later I heard from the other book discussion members even the title was a let down as Morgan never actually passed away (`twould have been a fitting end though - much like converting a testy horse into glue, something of actual use.) I've never read any of Anne Tyler's books but after this little gem I doubt I'll ever pick up another. 
 This book has very little to do with mediumship! At best it's a general overview of all things psychic. There are no instructions or exercises. Most of the chapters are on unrelated topics, even the chapters on mediumship aren't actually about mediumship and instead focus on why you'd want to become a medium, why you'll want to work hard as a medium, and ways to dress as a medium 
 This is DTS's ploy to confuse the public. DVD-A has nothing to do with DTS. This is a DTS encoded disc. It is not even a red book CD 
 This story of a chid id poverty-stricken India was hard to keep reading. The lack of plot put me right to sleep. I got a few chapters in and couldn't finish it. Don't waste your money on this 
 This is the 2nd one that I purchased since May.  The first one quit lifting & Toy r Us didn't have any more so I purchase the 2nd online & the rubber that makes it go is off both wheels & because it is now over 30 days I can not get another or an exchange.  My son loves playing in the sandbox with the toy but for the money it is not good I have not had one to last over a month yet. The toy has been broken for now 3 weeks so I average the life of the toy of the toy to be no more than a month at best.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS A WASTE OF MONEY! 
 I bought this book hoping for clues to help my high school students.  It didn't happen. This book would be a good choice for college instructors.  
 I understood the basic concept. I understood the idea that in attempting to blow up a Sudanese sight, two B-2 pilots were captured, tortured, and a rescue was planned. I even understood the minute intricacies of the rescue  plan. But why was the character called "Meredith" never explained  or developed? What was his part in the whole thing? Were there two stories  going on? I think the author attempted to mix politics with  action/adventure and failed. Technicalities and legalese were mixed and  confusing as well. In all, it was a very difficult story to follow. Many  pages I read just because they were there, and I felt as though if I read  them over and over again I still wouldn't get it. If you are truly bored to  tears and there is no other book available, you might enjoy some of this  book. Otherwise, forget it. It sucks 
 The first part of the book is thrilling and page turning. The way Judge Ramsey found Emma. The way Molly found Judge Ramsey. Everything will keep you in the book. But the last hundred pages or so she really misses the plot. You'd ask yourself where's the plot? You'll read about a propousal, Ireland, a wedding, and many more stories that shouldn't been there. And as nigh all of her books, the end is a fairy tale that nobody'll believe. There are better books than this one 
 Well, we ordered this for a trip and it's "delayed" even though it says it's in stock.  We got a vauge email that says "delayed" but no promise of delivery.... don't order it from Amazon if you're exhausted chasing an escaping baby!  Go to a local store and purchase it........waiting.......waiting.......waiting...... 
 I kept falling asleep reading this book.  He keeps repeating the same thing paragraph after paragraph.  I found His Needs Her Needs to be a much better book 
 I read the previous review and decidid to buy the book anyway.  The previous reviewer was absolutely correct -- nothing new here.  I believe readers would be better served with Lyn Siler's two previous books 
 So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin.   There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural,  mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong.  
 But I won't because I paid good money for it.  As you can see from the other reviews, the speed on this thing is pathetic, almost to the point of non-functional when it comes to many small files.  I had a small game on the drive, but it has tons of small files in the folder. It took over 10 minutes to delete a 10 mb folder... makes you wonder if SanDisk spent 10 minutes to test this thing. Stay away.. or if you really want one, buy mine please 
 My good sense tells me that writing this book made the Matersons feel better about themselves.  My mind tells me to thank God I never went the way of abuse or criminal activity.  My experience tells me we all have a life story to tell.  Reading this book showed me most of us do not tell our story to make money or a movie.  If the Matersons want money and fame here's some advice:  try fiction or learn how to write without being so self-serving 
 but this cd is just that. There isn't 1 song worthy of a second playing or radio airplay. Sorry John. 
 My three year-old loved this toy, and was very careful with it, but the gear that holds the arm controlling the shovel in position broke after two weeks of use.  Very disappointing.  
 Are customers to guess what is a "small" size compared to a "large size?" Is the small for a todder, pre-schooler or teenager? What a waste of time trying to find information on this web-site about the sizes.  
 This book is so full of misinformation that I shudder to think (since it is in the "dummies" series), that this may be the only information that many people will read before they embark upon a very serious commitment with a dog.     It is poorly researched, full of dogma and nonsense.     If you have to read a "quick book" find one written by an expert - a veterinarian, or anyone with a track record in animals. Instant info can be found on bulletin discussion boards, magazines etc 
 Man did I want to like this movie. Hackman is the best and the possibility of finding a mid-70s Gem was really tantalizing, but...this film is really, really mediocre. First we have sub-plot city going on, bad mid life crisis stuff with Susan Clark and Hackman "Trying to communicate" about their failing relationship. It's tough on Hackmans character "Harry" see 'cause he used to be an NFL player and now he's reduced to being a private eye, she hates it, he does not want to give it up and everyone concerned gets a bad speech.  Don't get me wrong, this is no "MegaForce", where the film is so bad it becomes campy and actually enjoyable. This is just...mediocre. Buy "Harper" with Paul Newman instead 
 Over the years (decades actually), Peter Eisenman's "Terragni" took on something of the urban myth, an elusive, unpublished work, supposedly of great genius.  Draft copies were jealously hoarded by a few insiders adding to the myth.  Now, after 40 years, it appears in print, no longer only the stuff of legend, but an actuality exposed to real scrutiny.  Frankly, the wait has not been worth it.  Exhaustively drafted from every conceivable projection and angle, the images of the building are accompanied by a text (a `critical text', the author repeatedly informs us), that pushes the limits only of the ridiculous.  For example: the plan of the Casa del Fascio, Eisenman "discovers", is a square, or rather, almost a square.  In order to satisfy Eisenman's supposition, the true square, it seems, is realized only when particular window is opened fully to the 90 degree position, thereby implying a volumetric extension of the building, which then completes the so-called purity of the geometry.  The fact that other windows on other sides of the building might also be opened at the same time thereby undermining the purported geometrical purity, does not seemed to have occurred to the author so blinded is he by the supposed brilliance of this, the most pretentious of studies. Numerous equally untenable speculations flesh out the remainder of this overwrought, but ultimately fruitless examination.  Terragni's classical parti is studiously avoided by the author who is largely ignorant of the precepts that underlie this, the most basic formal arrangement that Terragni carried through his design.  Eisenman stretches similar guesswork beyond the point of irritation as though insulting the intelligence of his readers is one of the underlying purposes of this book.  In the architectural industry, asinine speculation, masquerading as theory or as philosophical inquiry, are now the norm. This particular book has been billed as Peter Eisenman's "eagerly awaited magnum opus".   Certainly the Casa del Fascio is deserving of study.  However, if perchance "Giuseppe Terragni: Transformations, Decompositions, Critiques" does achieve long-lasting fame, it can only be for becoming the late 20th Century's high water mark of architectural pretentiousness and unbounded historical ignorance.

 Before I bought the Pasajes series, I was relieved to see the (then) mostly positive reviews.  However, I really feel like the overall review score of 4.5 stars is very, very misleading.  I would not, in good faith, be able to recommend this series of books for learning Spanish.    This series of books was VERY confusing and EXTREMELY difficult to work with.  Some of the many issues with using this series of books to learn spanish:  1) the concepts are not clearly explained (they invented a "new" english word for one) and the exercises are excessively complicated and do not give you enough practice with the vocabulary/concepts to feel confident using them.    2) Frequently, new words, phrases and concepts are introduced in the middle of a lesson about something else, via a footnote, with no further explaination provided!!  This is SUPER frustrating and distracting!  3) Using this series of books is very cumbersome, the books are not well coordinated with one another, and do not appear to reinforce each other's concepts or vocabulary.  I'm very sorry, but these books are just terrible, and 4.5 stars is not at all reflective of the quality of these books... Using this series of books has taken ALL the fun out of learning Spanish, which I used to enjoy.  If you have the option to use different books, take it 
 Having used the book in the course taught by Merino, I have noticed that the examples given at the end of each chapter are erroneous in nature.  Many a time, I have found that the book lacks the basic elements of engineering economics.  This book is definitely not for undergraduates 
 A disappointing purchase, this cannot be the last word on the subject.  The book is a pretty dry read. Bill James has printed similar types of essays in various books in a much more lively and entertaining style.  Also, some of the methods used and assumptions made are very questionable. (I am an MBA with over 20 years experience in compiling and using statistical data.)  Felber's book can only be recommended to the really hardcore fan who is willing to wade through a lot of really boring prose 
 You will first encounter one of the biggest lines of BS when you read Elvis Costello's foreword where he describes Mr. Emerick at the end of the second paragraph: "You could not meet a more modest and self-effacing man". If Geoff Emerick truly has such qualities you'll be hard pressed to find it in this book because the journeyman hack he hired in writing this piece of rubbish does too well of a job in presenting him as completely the opposite. Other reviewers have mentioned the constant fawning over Paul McCartney at every opportunity, the absurd trashing of George Harrison and Ringo Starr at every other opportunity, and the insensitive denouncing of John Lennon in between those opportunities. The put-downs he throws towards George Martin are just childish. This is such an annoying book that halfway through, this long-time Beatles aficionado who was greatly looking forward to reading it had to stop. To paraphrase George Harrison, "it's a drag, a well-known drag... 
 Amazon's site made no mention of the products not being in stock, charged my cc, and then mocafe held the order without mentioning that shipment was backordered.  My first call to mocafe received a nebulous response along with an offer to leave a voice mail for someone else, and my second call (upon not receiving a return call) revealed the real facts.  Having a credit card charged for items not in stock is *not* cool.  Beware 
 All of these songs are being re-released on this album.  I am a huge, huge Dylan fan, but buy the songs as they originally appear on the original albums, as Dylan originally intended 
 This is worse than Kumbya over and over and over again. 
 As other reviewers have been, I'm also unhappy with the removal of central plot elements, especially Mrs. Cheveley's broach.  The effect of removing this element is that it is Chiltern who saves Goring, not Goring who saves Chiltern, and the play therefore never gives Goring his moment of heroism and nobility.  This film  is too jolly and innocent.  Laura Cheveley's hubris, Robert Chiltern's anguish, these are really side shows in the film which focuses more on Goring, his wit, and his pre-marital uncertainty.  I do think the film is entertaining, for what it is worth.  Anyone who has an interest in romantic comedy or a very casual interest in Wilde will probably enjoy it.  If you know this play and Oscar Wilde well, though, you may be frustrated 
 I had such high hopes for this one!  However, after about a dozen tries, I cannot stand this music.  It is uninteresting and possibly contains the worst songwriting and lyrics I have heard in years.  Or maybe it's the schmultzy music that is so unbelievably weak.  Whatever it is, it has no magic, no risk, no intelligence.    
 In page xvii of the introduction, Dr. Amen writes "Stimulant medications such as Adderall, Ritalin, or Dexedrine are among the safest and most effective medications in psychiatry". That sounds reassuring until you read the article in Medical News Today (August 22, 2006) mentioning that "Dexedrine and Ritalin are drugs used to treat ADHD. The FDA announced changes to their labels, and possibly those of some other ADHD drugs, to include a warning of a risk of heart problems and psychotic behavior". That is not reassuring at all. This book is writing in an authoritative style - sort of the bible of ADHD, the book that tells you what it is, and how to go about it. The only problem is that it is flawed.  
 I already knew almost everything in this book, so I was disappointed when it arrived and I started looking through it. I ordered it hoping it would give me a simple explanation "for dummies" on what pivot tables are and how to create/work with them.  They're not even listed in the index!  This book is great at covering all the very basic how-tos for someone who's never worked with Excel before; but it doesn't delve deeply enough into what the program can really do 
 I bought this book because it had a CD-ROM with NCLEX-type questions. Unfortunately, the CD-ROM can't be used on computers without Windows 98 or higher. I took the disk to my college library, hoping to use the disk on one of the PC machines there, but I discovered that the disk has to be installed on the computer. Installing software on public computers is verboten at my school. This means the CD-ROM is basically worthless to me. The book itself is basically an outline of a Med-Surg nursing textbook. There are surprisingly few illustrations for a study guide.   Bottom line: If you like studying dry lists and you own a PC with Windows 98 or higher, Pentium 166 or higher, 64 MB RAM or more, and 8 MB of free hard-disk space, this book might be for you. However, if you like studying with memory aids, graphs, charts, drawings, and spoon-feeding explanations of complex concepts, don't waste your money on this book 
 This book was obviously written with the intent of deifying a minor movement that had virtually no impact on US foreign policy towards South Africa.  The 'evidence' that was provided to justify some of these claims seem to come out of nowhere (as they likely must have).  If you want to add another book to your collection which has completely recreated history with regards to South Africa, buy this book!  If you want an enlightened account of US Economic Policies with regards to South Africa, keep searching 
 I was looking forward to gaining some real insights with this book.  However, it is one of the most disapointing books on the subject I have read.  The infomation is dated, the size of the book is pitifull. Trying to remain objective, there are a few handy formulas for detailed calculations, the rest of the information here is old news, and all available for free on the net. Ed has, in the past written some of the best and most well known material on this subject.  But this book is just not worth buying.  Ed Rosenthal where has your integrity gone 
 More regurgitated destructive orthodoxy from the arid soul of an academic hack, it's all here every careerist leftist's cliche there is.  The arrogance of the previous reviewer could only come from a button down Yalie politically correct snob 
 While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing.  The sequence near the end in Venice was pure agony and I came ever so close to giving up.  However, having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book.  While the last few chapters helped to redeem the book, all in all the book disappointed, including the apparent tee off for a second volume.  Assuming there is a sequel, I'm not likely to purchase it 
 In today's time, words are not enough to describe a sleight. Reading this book is not very easy. I would appreciate more pictures, more details . Many pictures in the book are completly useless and should be replaced by detailed photos. Sorry, I don't like it 
 Average book. Good pictures. Very few and low quality drawings, Not a significant research source for architects.. 
 This book was so awful that I, a book lover, literally threw it into the trash.  The author certainly did not portray either the Elizabeth or the Darcy that appear in the novel.  Anyone who has read Pride and Prejudice would never believe that Darcy would abandon Elizabeth after an argument where his position was defending Lady Catherine de Bourgh!  Or that Elizabeth would lock Darcy out of the bedroom defending her Mother!  That is just the worst example from the book.  Like Mr. Collins would treat Elizabeth badly and not understand that at some point there would be retribution from Mr. Darcy?  That Georgiana would become close to Caroline Bingley and turn on Elizabeth (and therefore her Brother) is so absurd that I am amazed that anyone would publish this utter nonesense.  I hope this write up prevents anyone else from wasting their money on this ridiculous book.  Had there been a "no star" category, that is the one that I would have chosen 
 Page 328: "... For example, out of a worldwide total of $9 trillion in international bank loans and deposits in 2001, only about $700 billion went to poor countries-less than one percent. Out of $12 trillion in international investment securities, only about $600 billion went to poor countries, an even smaller fraction of one percent. ..."  I really enjoyed this book until I read this passage, now I'm doubting everything I've ever learned about math 
 Not one of the better ones.  Really shallowly written.  Sounds like a ghost writer (the ghost writer's first book in the series) to me 
 This book was a waste of the 30 minutes it took me to read. Seriously if you need to read this book you should not be building a website. Let someone else do it for you. This book should be given to foreign programmers as they have no clue. If you surf the web everyday you will have all of the knowledge that this book provides. Nothing new here, he just puts together ideas he thinks work. I only found one page of the book helpful. I run an e-commerce company for tall men's clothing and my friend told me to read this book. A waste of time if you ask me if you haven't already figured it out 
 I have read some nonsense in my time... Wha?  But this book is just dreadful.  Only a complete jackass would put this book on their X-mas list... Wha? My friend Celine who is a complete nerd... Wha? would love  this book, but that is it... Wha 
 A very sad and depressing book about an unhappy teenager.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you like feeling worse than before you started reading 
 Although this text may be of assistance to some, it may also be used incorrectly and the criteria set forth in the DSM-IV-R is stringent, complete, and also complex.  Do not confuse this edition for the one you will need when working the psych ward or in higher education seeking a degree in a psych or psychiatric related field 
 I love werewolves, and I eagerly bought this book though wanted to return it when I was finished. This book, though beautifully written, has flat, one-dimensional, underdeveloped characters and majorly underdeveloped relationships. Kern and Ainsy barely knew each other and they rushed into sex just like that. Ainsy started out as a strong female character, sometimes snappish but a sweetheart on the inside, and she ends up a helpless damsel in distress when I expected her to tell off the harper and give him a good slap. The plot was thin, with not enough emotion, and the characters simply go with the flow, never developing their own characteristics. But the prose is excellent and breath-taking; I'd like to read other books from this author, though I'll check them out from a library first. The author has a fantastic way with words 
 I was excited to try this product as I love Oreos, but don't like all the garbage that goes into them. We tried Newman-O's Originals...my wife went first, and the look on her face said it all. Still, I had to see for myself. We both decided they taste like wood chips disguised as Oreo cookies. For some reason, others seem to think they taste great. Just do yourself a favor and try small before you buy large.. 
 Growing up in the Delta I find a lot to dislike about this exercise in academic revisionism of Southern history. The author is clearly ignorant of those times that shaped the history of the Delta, the floods of 1927 and '37 followed by the migrations of black people to the North followed by the mechanical cotton picker, followed by the emmigration of light industry to the "new" south. This superficial book is typical of the ideological rectitude among apologists that permeate parochial history departments. A person wishing to understand the psyche of the Delta should read instead, "Lanterns on the Levee",or "Rising Tide", both available from Amazon.com 
 This book was a real chore to plow through for me. What could have been a good story was marred by a jumbled plot and unsympathetic characters. In the end I was relieved to finish this and move on to greener pastures.  The plot at its simplest is similar to "The Lovely Bones" or "She's Come Undone"--at least the latter was also and Oprah book--where a girl is raped and the family goes all to pieces in the aftermath. In this case darling cheerleader and chaste Christian Marianne is raped after the prom in 1976. Until that time the Mulvaneys were a respected family. The father Michael Sr. owned a successful roofing company. The mother Corinne was active in the community and churches. The oldest son Michael Sr. was a star athlete and the other son Patrick on his way to becoming valedictorian. This all changes after the rape. In the community the Mulvaneys become pariahs. Michael Sr. becomes a raging alcoholic and loses his business. Michael Jr. joins the Marines. Patrick takes vengeance on his sister's rapist and then disappears to live off the grid. And Marianne is bundled off to live with a cousin before joining a hippie commune. And from there things get worse until they get better.  The first 100 pages or so reads like "The Waltons" written in the style of "The Shipping News" with lots of run-on sentences and fragments. Oates dances around the rape for a long time, well after anyone with an iota of intelligence has figured out what's happened. Especially annoying to me was when Marianne finally tells her mother, instead of getting to the aftermath of this we're hauled back for a flashback 24 years earlier of how Michael and Corinne got together. That's worse than those soap opera cliffhangers that make you wait 3 days (or longer) to find out who shot someone.  The biggest problem with the book then is after the rape. Everything from then out is told in jumbled snippets. Most of the growing and maturing the Mulvaney children do as they scatter from the nest is done outside the book so that we see only glimpses of it. It is essentially like looking at a family photo album where you see a picture of someone at 10 then 16 then 18 then 24 but you don't really know what happened between all those snapshots. Perhaps that was the author's intention, but it takes away from having a cohesive narrative.  It's amazing when you go back and think about it how absent the Mulvaney children are from much of the book. Michael Jr. goes off to the Marines and is almost never heard from again until the end. After Patrick takes his vengeance he too disappears with at least a third of book left. The youngest son (and narrator) Judd was barely present to start with. Marianne gets a couple extended parts towards the end and I wish she didn't because she was so danged precious, as innocent as a small child even at the age of 29; that got on my nerves.  There was no one in the book I was rooting for because I didn't like any of them. Michael Jr. and Judd are exempt because they were all but invisible so there was nothing to like. Patrick was an obnoxious know-it-all, sort of the Lisa Simpson or Stewie Griffin of the Mulvaney clan. I already went into Marianne. Michael Sr. was just a mean drunk (can you ever like someone who exiles his own daughter for being raped) and Corinne was such a spineless, overzealous doormat.  The author had this annoying habit too of overusing some expressions. Especially Marianne "plucking" her hair. It's amazing she had any left by the end. In the epilogue, Corinne mica-shimmering silver hair was referenced three times at least in case you were too dense to figure it out the first time. This is the kind of stuff that annoys me because I'm a very analytical reader, but I doubt most people would care.  Were there good things about the book? Sure. The descriptions that weren't overused were good. The characters mostly had different, albeit irritating, personalities. So it's got that going for it.  Bottom line is if you're a fan of Oprah books like the two I mentioned earlier then this is probably right up your alley. It's not for me.  That is all 
 America's first album from 1972, the self-titled one, was a masterpiece. This is the third album (as the title suggests) from 1974. So what's it like?  I find that this band have very rarely focused on what they are good at, that is acoustic pop. Too often they have tried to be an eerie, progressive rock band, a funk band, an adult contemporary band and what not. Only the self titled album, some of it's folow up (homecomming) and 'Human Nature' from about 25 years later deal with what America are all about, country guys singing about countryside and birds and how we could all live a better life if we relaxed more.   The problem with "Hat-trick" is that it doesn't play to America's strengths, at all. It tries to be a progressive rcok album and mixes in all these airy-fiary psuedo-satanic lyrics into their music. Like the 8-minute title track is about a broken teenage love affair, but then they start saying "You're a bat out of hell", but it doesn't work. If you're going to sing about "Bats out of hell" sing it with conviction, like Dewey sings on something like "Hangover", don't sing all soft. I mean they are a soft-folk rock band trying to sing about scary monsters getting you in the middle of the night.  On the plus side you get the tracks on the Greatest hits album; "Muskrat Love", "Rainbow Song" and "She's Gonna Let You Down", all vintage 70's pop. I can't remember anything memorable from the other songs. "Green Monkey" and "Molten Love" try to sound so scary, but don't. "Willow tree lullaby" is the best of the rest but doesn't feel like much more than a card-carrying folk track that feels rather throw-away. Overall I would give the album about 3/10 (1.5 stars)  They never really recovered from poor directional decisions, though have made some pretty good music since, though the best album since their first album is surely "Human Nature".  That bitchin' done, don't hesitate to add this one to your collection and I hope you enjoy it, because, why did they make the album? For someone out there to enjoy themselves while they listened to it. This "old scrooge" didn't, but hopefully you do. 
 If you want your point of view to prevail, it helps to be the last survivors, and Diana and Deborah Mitford managed that much.  Yes, folks, this is yet another apologia for those jolly fascist sympathetizers, Diana and Unity Mitford.  Deborah is, luckily for her, uninterested in politics, but she has supported Diana's poses (who-me-anti-Semitic?), which is unfortunate for this book.  The poor dumbstruck bourgeois author is thoroughly star-stuck by the glamourous Duchess and my Lady Moseley, and so we get no insight, no judgment, and good deal of discreet mud-slinging at the Mitford sister who was indiscreet enough to marry a Jew.  Because, you know she embarrassed her family by doing that---Unity's writing to a crappy German newspaper and declaring herself publicly as a 'Jew-hater' pales in comparison.    Since Diana has since kicked the bucket, aged 90 (support for the notion that the good die young), only the pernicious Duchess is left to bear of the standard of family before all.  I suspect the real story of the Mitfords won't emerge until she is no longer alive to prevent it 
 Like most people who made the effort to see this movie, I read Tim Sandlin's book and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Unfortunately for this movie, Sandlin is a far better novelist than screenwriter.  The film is disjointed, awkward, and hard to follow. It quickly hops from one important moment of the book to another, allowing almost no time to understand the characters and their motivations or appreciate the bizarre circumstances of the story.  The casting isn't bad-- a prepubescent Mischa Barton was a fine choice (a hysterical one for fans of the O.C.), and Jennifer Jason Leigh is also respectable, although she doesn't fit her character's physical description-- but that doesn't nearly make up for the film's jumpy direction and half-baked plot.  In sum, this is a dissatisfying and substandard film. Undoubtedly, the subject matter is better suited for a novel, and Sandlin's humor and talents are better utilized there.  Read his books. Avoid this movie. 
 This has to be one of the worst books on any form of Witchcraft I've read in a long time.  It's bad enough the amount of fluff out there supporting Wicca as the only way for modren witches, but this book has too many harmful ideas to be believed or even to be recommended.  Is it a new thing to quote long passages and base a tremendous portion of ones ideas on certain passages and books and not to even give the original authors etc. credit?  Many times, Cabot quotes things or references an idea from somewhere, without ever stating were that somewhere is.  And with as many unfounded claims and ideas that this woman has, one would really like to know where they're coming from.  To not cite, makes me think that she's just creating half this stuff.    The ideas, especially at the front half of the book are harmful to many would-be's.  Don't read this book! I got it used and it was still a waste of money.  It's not going to help you with anything, and may even cloud your mind with unfounded ideas, such as women where the sole inventors of language.  Give me a break.  Stay away from this book! Even McCoy is better then this dribble.  But what can one expect from a woman who runs around in goth, calling it traditinal witch wear.  I really feel for her family, espcecially her kids 
 My mother-in-law presented me with this book in a poor attempt to convert me into Christianity.   I tried to read the book as thoroughly as possible. It was difficult to keep interested in the first half of the book. In my personal opinion, the author seems to ramble on about the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin on many occasions, this seems to be his only method of proving that the "Bible Code" does in fact, exist.   Not to mention his constant reminding that he 'does not believe in God or prophecies.' This gets very tiring. Drosnin does not provide solid evidence, no matter how he tries to dress it up with scientific terms. The author kills his credibility on repeated occasions.   Overall, I found this to be an interesting read, but the author's arguements were not convincing enough for me. 
 The author belies a hostility towards his subject early on in the book by referring to him as "Charlie" as though he was the cop on "Bad Boys" who had caught the guy in the video who had obviously  done something which gave him the right to speak condescendingly to him.   In Clark's own mind Olson has become an unworthy father who he has to beat  down.  Wierd !  Totally misses the point of Olson's art which is that each  page is different and a unique attempt at truth.   Shows too how the  Thruway West (oh Gunslinger) has obliterated belief in an actual earth of  value. Which Olson's actual text does manage to keep alive 
 Originally published in 1952, The Courage to Be by Paul Tillich is a compilation of the Terry Lectures delivered by the author in the same year. Tillich is a well known mid-twentieth century German-American liberal theologian. The following comments pertain to the 2000 re-release by Yale University Press  The lectures discuss the issue of courage and, are largely a response to some of the bleak existentialist philosophy prevalent at the time. I found the aspects of the text discussing existentialism to be the most interesting.  To the appropriate liberal academic audience in the early 1950's these lectures might have sounded majestic.  Tillich weaves a broad story touching on a range of philosophical, political, historic and scientific themes.  Fifty years later it feels dated and superficial; some of the themes e.g. existentialism, Freudism and Marxism are now somewhat passé and may be of limited interest to many modern readers.  This is not to say that the work is without value, I find that Tillich is always effective at conveying the majesty of God. Tillich was by all accounts a capable intellect, however, his ability as a communicator is limited; his use of language while occasionally poetic is often wordy and vacuous, while his argumentation can be sublime, it is frequently speculative and specious.  The Courage to Be is probably only of interest to Tillich fans.   
 This certainly isn't the book I expected after reading Coalescent. Where Coalescent was an interesting exploration of how a new form of human society could form, and had fairly well thought out characters and dialog, Exultant almost completely drops every one of the themes from the first book, and takes a hard right into space opera. Except for one or two incredibly brief nods to the eusocial societies of the first book, Exultant is pretty much wall to wall blazing lasers with stock characters. Some of the concepts are interesting, but it all needed to be sorted out much better. 
 I am passionate about my career and very interested in the particular challenges faced by women in a male-dominated workplace.  I did not find what I needed here -- the book is rather aimless and unnecessarily chatty, rather than providing the kind of focus that I expected from a book with such a direct title!  Lewis's best advice is to be happy where you are and "find joy" while "waiting for that promotion".  I don't have time to wait for a promotion!  If I have a job in my sites, I'm not going to let a day go by just waiting and appreciating where I am.  If I was willing to do that, I wouldn't have bought a book called "Climbing the Ladder . . .".  Some will find Lewis's religious sentiments comforting and inspiring, but I found that it gave the wrong tone to the book.  She is outspoken about her beliefs that things happen for a higher purpose and everything is planned out for us.  Her strategies deal mainly with how to bolster yourself until your big chance finally falls into your lap. If these are not your beliefs, and you need real help to get up and moving, take warning before you invest your time in this book.  As a self-help book for women who need comfort, this is a good choice. If you need practical career advice, look elsewhere.  And I can't resist one small rant here. I got tired of her continual plaint:  "Poor me!  Stuck with this high-power career and all I ever really wanted was to be a stay-at-home mom!! 
 Ritter flip-flopped his WMD position after finding a place on Al Jazeera's payroll.  Al Jazeera is openly sympathetic to Islamofascists, who aim to kill us.  Ritter's arrest was not his first pedophilia-related entanglement, and it's a bit too "black helicopter" to think that local law enforcement sleazebag round-ups are really plots to silence political enemies 
 This is an interesting premise (that's why I bought it) and an awful read. As characters, the saurians had no appeal to make me care what happened to them and, frankly, neither did the humans.  I was longing for Enya, the "26-million-year death-star" to reduce the whole bunch of them to a fine powder 
 I'm a beginer sewer.  I just took my first 2 lessons in sewing, and am able to use my machine to make simple things, like pillows.  I checked this book out from our library, and looked at the first project.  It seems pretty complicated, and I felt like there were some steps missing.  It was explaining how to create a simple apron, but the steps didn't all make sense to me.  I think this book is more for an intermediate sewer, who knows more of the terminology, and all ready understands basic sewing methods 
 This book uses a lot of buzz words and offers very little substantial advice when it comes to actually designing your own house.  It touches a little on straw bale and reused materials and barely grazes cob/clay/rammed earth.  It doesn't even mention geodesic domes as far as I can tell.  The book advocates on one page (p.72) that people should live in small humble buildings, only having the square footage they absolutely need.  Then a few pages later (p.79) it shows a 4000+ sq. ft. home, with the title "an excersize in efficiency."  I fail to see anything efficeint about a 4000 sq. ft. home, especially when it's a standard A-frame building (granted, it's for a family of 6, but then again there's nothing "green" about having 4 children).  It does cover some good stuff like gray-water use, rain collection, alternative heating and cooling, but it glosses over all of this and takes up a lot of space with strange-angled shots of rooms and floor plans.  I KNOW the floor plan I want, and there's very little that a floor plan has to do with green building (it's more about orientation to the sun for passive solar use).  What I'd prefer to have seen was simple diagrams of how the systems of the house work.  There's a spot that explains how one house has the pool hooked up to the AC such that the hot exhaust from the AC heats the pool.  Now THAT's something I can get into, but I want more than a couple sentences about it.  That deserves a diagram 
 This book represents literally the worst scholarship I have ever seen.  It makes no pretense of careful, thorough, or new research into its subject, but relies almost exclusively on two secondary sources--both in English, both still in print.  Its dependence on Jack Beeching's book on the same subject is so thorough that it renders this book completely superfluous.   I feel like my time and money were wasted on this when I could have skipped it entirely and headed directly to the source.  In addition to its total lack of new insight into the subject, the book seems not have benefitted from editorial oversight prior to publication.  In one chapter, the same quotation is used in two different contexts, citing two different sources, with no attempt at explanation.  Indeed, I was surprised to find several ungrammatical sentences scattered throughout, as if an early draft had somehow made it to the presses.  If this was a term paper, it would have been handed back for a rewrite.   There is no excuse for something of such poor quality sitting on bookstore shelves.  It is insulting to the reader that this book was ever allowed to the see the light of day.  The authors ought to have their academic credentials revoked 
 The cover of this book promises that it will show you how to apply trend following to your porfolio. "Covel walks you through the process, one step at a time, in plain English." This is misleading. Aside from a back test on some basic systems, there is no concrete discussion on how to trade trends in the entire book. The portraits of the major trend followers are not uninteresting, but Jack Schwager's Market Wizard series is far superior. Covel also goes to great lengths to "prove" that trend followers were on the winning side of all the major crises and meltdowns of the last decade (e.g. LTCM), but the only proof he offers is that a number of trend followers had gains in the months where others were losing. Much of the book is packed with statistical data on performance that might be of interest to someone writing a thesis on the subject. If that's who you are, buy the book, but don't expect much nuts and bolts information on making money in the market.  
 As has been mentioned above, I really wanted to like this book.  We chose it for our Jewish book discussion club.  I found it very disappointing.  It was plotless and focused on such silly pointless things (the details of sexual encounters) instead of the rich historical surroundings.  At least it did not engage me at all and I'm astonished to read so many glowing reviews.  I learned nothing from the book.  Every time it verged upon a great story it veered back to the plodding go-nowhere writing.  Sorry. Didn't like it.   
 After years of hearing about what a seminal work this is, I finally broke down and bought a (used) copy.  I expected something like the anti-Simon, an exhaustive documentation of how we are inevitably headed toward doom and collapse unless the government steps in to intervene with specific recommendations.  I was extremely surprised to find that this book is nothing more than a long description of the authors' computer model!  Is that it?!  Apparently so.  The authors assembled a computer model of all human activity and natural science, complete with feedback, time delay, and other parameters (yeah, they really present it that way!).  Then they ran it through a computer and found what they expected - quite a surprise, eh?  Then they tweak on the basic model and find that almost nothing leads to a rosy scenario.  Humanity is going to collapse by 2100, and there is nothing we can do about it.  Well, almost nothing.  Apparently, if we stop procreating, stop economic growth, and spread the existing wealth evenly, everything will be ... well, it won't be great, but it will be "okay", sorta like the warehousing activity that we call public "schooling".  I think there is a book that describes the resulting society, ... I believe it was called _Anthem_.  I gave the book a couple of stars because of its canonical status, but it certainly doesn't deserve the attention it has gotten.  A major flaw is that they don't describe the model they use in any significant detail to allow you to run the numbers yourself (they refer you to another article, and you can find the original model on the internet if you're perseverent enough).  If someone is throwing this into your face as proof that we are headed to certain disaster, fear not.  There simply isn't enough substance here, some of the information and assumptions are dated, and you can certainly point out a few holes in their model assumptions that tend to undo their long-term analysis.  If you are thinking about using this to support your world view, please reconsider.  Try something a little more grounded in reality, without the breathless hype, like any environmental economics book by Tom Tietenberg 
 It is a well known fact among scientists that global warming is REAL and that humans are at least contributing to this planet's rising average temperature.  It is also a fact that the oil cronies are trying to spread misinformation that global warming is either not occurring or that humans are not having any affect on it.  These oil cronies also want everyone to think that if global warming is not a myth, it's a debate among scientists.  Furthermore, many of the scientific research that shows that WE are causing global warming have been suppressed by oil industry special interests.  Bush, who does everything to cater to the oil industry, has suppressed much of this knowledge himself.  This book is just part of this special interest propaganda.  The bottom line is this: GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL AND IS CAUSED BY PEOPLE, AND EVERY TRUE SCIENTIST THAT IS NOT WORKING FOR SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS KNOWS THIS.  If you have any doubt about this, read the original research articles in PEER REVIEWED academic journals, and make sure that they are PEER REVIEWED.  PEER REVIEWED journals are where REAL knowledge and research get published.  This book is hogwash. 
 While purporting to 'embrace objectivity and think critically', LeGault repeatedly fails to do either.  His gratuitous bashing of other countries based on single figures from surveys smacks of both sloppy thinking and chauvinism.  As an example, to substantiate his view that the US is unfairly maligned as crime-ridden, he quotes a report that Sweden, "the United Nations' perennial merit-badge winner", has double the assaults of the United States, 667 versus 313 per 100,000. Could this statistic, if it's real, result from differential rates of reporting crime?  Quite possibly. Would it be reasonable to mention also that many reports indicate that the US has a homicide rate that's roughly 5 times that of Sweden?  Probably, if you are a critical thinker and/or concerned about crime rates.  LeGault also uses an unreferenced survey that supposedly indicates that two-thirds of Canadians say the US is a negative influence in the world to justify a rant about the "myth and balderdash dished out by the country's legions of left-leaning scholars and pundits". How objective of him to conclude, "it is not enough to scream 'Hypocrites! Ingrates!'" As a Canadian, I suspect that we do try to maintain a balanced view of the contributions of the US, both positive and negative, on the world scene. LeGault's reasoning implies that that because Canada is "dependent on trade with the US", anything that hints at criticism of American foreign policy is unacceptable.  There may well be some value to this book, however, it will require a concerted effort by the reader to separate the valid arguments from many that appear to be invalid or based entirely on such emotionally loaded thinking 
 Sorry - this book purchase was a gift and as yet the recipient has not given me any feedback; I'm not even sure if she's started reading it, so I'm unable to submit a review of the book's contents at this time. 
 The editorial review goes on about how lavish a production this movie was. It  really wasn't. Simply having a few cheap props, mono coloured rooms and a cast of extras dancing about doesn't mean much. Pit and the Pendulum was the most lavish production. Pit also had superior music. Masque suffers from a bland plot. The only thing that saves the movie was Price.   It should also be noted this dvd is not a quality dvd. It may not play in all players. I think this is the last "midnight movie" double features I buy. This is my second. The other plays in my computer's dvd player, both sides. This dvd only plays one movie on my computer's dvd player. No doubt these dvds are being ran off in someone's garage. 
 This book is about a man named Ray Atlee whose father has just died, leaving $3 million in unexplained cash.  Someone else knows about the money.  The three major questions for the book to answer are:  1) Where did the money come from? 2) Who is the mystery person (or people) trying to get it? 3) What will Ray do with it?  I have reached page 261 in this book, and NONE of these questions have been answered.  Ray has moved the money around, been vaguely threatened by person or persons unknown and had many conversations with side characters that all led nowhere.  261 pages in, all I know is where the money DIDN'T come from.  This is a legal thriller that does not thrill.  The pacing is deadly dull and I keep waiting, waiting, WAITING for something to happen and nothing does.  Finally I threw the book down in frustration an hour or so ago when I realized how close to 300 pages I'd gotten with nothing happening.  I don't know why I even gave the book this much of a chance.  Nothing bad has happened to him, and even though three million is at stake, none of the bad guys have taken any but the most harmless ways of trying to get it.  If they were really following him as much as it's alluded to in the book, they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash.  He spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car, for God's sake!  I may finish it one day, but as of now I just don't care about the money or the characters who are after it.  Not Grisham's best, by a long shot 
 Having to study this book for an undergraduate Middle East course, I was wearily annoyed at Dr. Goldschmidt's illuminated bias during the entire book.  Chapter 3 alone is no where near a "history" but rather an author's editorial justifying any and all actions of Muhammad, including the slaughter of Jews during the seventh century for not accepting the authority of Muhammad as a prophet or messiah, adultery, polygamy, theft and pre-emptive war in support of it all.  Dr. Goldschmidt portrays the Western and Christian world as ignorant to understanding the great works of Muhummad and trys to pull any new student of the Middle East and Islam into his little realm of prejudices.  Any humane Christian or Jew who reads this book will be outraged at Dr. Goldschmidt's justifications.  I understand history is bias but history isn't insane.  This book most certainly deserves no praise 
 The pathetic thing about scams like this is that we're all searching for ways to secure our future. The thing is, Russ Whitney was a smart guy who did some real estate investing... then, he decided to become SMARTER and offer his "Secrets to Success" to everyone else for a fee!  How intelligent is that??? Be realistic people. There are no (legal) shortcuts to fortune other than hard work, inheritance, or winning the lottery. There is money to be made in real estate, and SOME gains may be as easy as he makes them look but the bulk of them are not. Am I rich? No, but I'm comfortable enough NOT to be willing to make someone ELSE RICH by buying products that only sell dreams. Due TRUE research people. Go to CNN.COM and look under Money. They have GREAT savings tips.. great investment tips.. Go to Fidelity.com... Don't make people like THIS Rich *RICHER* in the process. Honestly... any of us can take his book.. reword a few things.. write our own book... and sell some Dreams. Its pathetic. All these GET RICH schemes are designed to get the WRITER rich, NOT YOU! When you're up late at night watching TV and see all these bogus infomercials, turn the channel... Watch Nick @ Nite, anything but the "Dream Sellers". Invest your time and money in things that you can be proud of. Do TRUE research, don't follow behind someone who's only interested in "how much money you're willing to invest in your future" AKA "are you willing to pay for the next seminar because this initial free one is replay of the infomercial you saw on tv." It's designed to get you HYPED UP.  And how do I know?  Well, I've never been to one myself, but I asked my roommate to go to one on "Our" behalf... U know, just to check it out and bring back some Great Information!  Well, "Yeah Right" is an understatement... No great info, just a repeat of the infomercial and a list of prices for the "Upcoming Events." And myself, what I've done, is ordered information about an at-home business that supposedly required "No Selling" (How unrealistic right?) Well the whole thing was, you create a website and let the website sell the product for you... but how likely is that?  I mean, of course you gotta put some effort into it and ultimately you're doing what - SELLING. So luckily I only wasted $50, but some people waste hundreds even thousands on this type of stuff... Don't but the HYPE people. Don't buy it. Just accept that everyone in life is not going to have a mercedes and a $500,00 home... but if you really want it, work hard for it. Put in the time, the effort, and the research... there are honest ways of making a good future but you have to be patient.  And again, I say, do not follow the Dream Sellers like Russ Whitney, and all the others.. unless you have a strong desire to help Them get Richer while you look on in awe 
 With all that happens in this book,and much of it is somewhat far-fetched, the only thing that I did not buy were the choices made in the end. They were inconsistent with the character development throughout the book. I felt cheated 
 This comic is so stupid. When you boil it down, it's NOTHING but " White people do this, and black people do THIS" jokes with "Bush is stupid!" thrown into the mix. This is like an officially licensed webcomic. Not worth the money, or time to read it. And despite it's OCCAISIONAL message against racism, the jokes are usually racist. People who will enjoy this book are those who are too lazy to read a real boo 
 This book is only low to moderately useful to gamers that have been around for a while. If you are new to the game it may prove useful but the DMG has more than enough information as compared to this book. Cityscape provided better information and examples and led me to believe that this would be a quality product as well, I was wrong. If you are a collector or just have to have every book published by WoTC then I suggest you get it used and save a little money 
 Edward Rutherfurd attempts to tackle a huge amount of complex history and, and the same time, weave in generations of 5 major fictional families.  Historical fiction is generally both educational and fun to read but this book falls short on both accounts as the author seemingly could neither cut down on too much fictional work nor decide if he wanted it to be more of a fictional saga or an historical work.  Gore Vidal chose the latter in his American Chronical series but was clinical enough in his structure to choose just one fictional family and used 5 books to write about a 150 year period in American History.  Rutherfurd attempts to do it in one novel, with a much more complex topic, including, but not limited to, Irish politics, religion, relationships with England, France, Germany, the Vatican, the Scots and the internal forces of Catholics vs. Protestants (and subsets therein).  His job with these topics is decent but certainly not fully explored nor explained.  The fiction seems forced with vignettes interspersed - some good, many tedious.    I very much wanted to like this book.  The review were obviously quite good.  I kept waiting for it to get better.  In all candor, it is a lot of hype with to much attempted and very little delivered.  I would recommend this book only to those who really enjoy Rutherfurd's other writings or those who cannot get enough historical Irish fiction.  For those who would just like a good book on this topic, look elsewhere.  As for comparisons with Mitchner, there are unfounded.  
 I stopped reading after 150 pages. There are three interwoven tales. The first of a serial murderer who wanders around trying to evade a supernatural monster, and his half-crazy ex-wife who seems to get off on the prospect of being killed. The second of a high-tech pirate ship that wanders around, kills a few people, tries to find out something about a mysterious device. The third about two men who only seem to wander around aimlessly. And the prose, which initially felt interesting, seems to wander around aimlessly, too. A pity, since a nice SF world shines through 
 I was expecting to read a book about the Amish. What I read instead was a very self centered book about a woman searching, rather blindly, I felt, for herself.   She had very little in the way of insight into Amish life, even after spending a period of time with them. And her inability to get outside of her own head/her own life was not terribly interesting to read.  For someone who always longed to be a 'star,' I am sure publishing a book was quite a thrill for her. Shame she used the Amish as a platform for her own ego 
 This book bothered me a lot. The author begins by presenting himself and his spiritual quest and accomplishments. He tells us that he attained high states of consciousness. I guess this is done as a substitute to any scientific proof of what follows. Don't get me wrong. I don't deny his experiments or the data collected over years, or the validity of almost anyone of his statements. But generally, there is tendency from the author's part to at least vaguely indicate how he came to some of his conclusions! I think our time is better spent reading something else. Also, I recommend to anybody interested in reading this book to read what wikipedia has to say about the author 
 Flimsy, throwaway and ultimately utterly forgetable. This "song" just reeks of novelty. It's like the bastard love child of MC Hammer and Milli Vanilli, and actually no better than either of them. If I am to believe all the hype surrounding this group they are the hottest thing going. It quite frankly makes me glad I'm not a teenager anymore. 
 My wife and two year old like this cereal, however I find them to be extremely crunchy and unpleasant to eat. I prefer the Purely O's, just wish they came in an eco pack 
 The concept is cute, although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them, but the main problem is that they give you hat hair, compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head.  Regular glasses go in between the hairs, so everything fluffs out.  If you never take off your reading glasses, have a buzz cut, are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head (but be careful of buns), the clic connect reader may be fine for you.  Otherwise, conventional glasses are a better bet 
 Very simplistically written. Interesting topic and examples but the first part is way too elementary and self serving of the author.  Some new information but not riveting 
 .... and a little mouse is born. A flaccid bladder of utter banality inflated by the hot air of middle-brow legalism and obscurantist prose. No exploration of any depth or detail is carried out of the disruption wrought by a market-dependent way of life on the ecological, anthropological, cultural, social, political and psychological fibres that hold together the world's various societies, or on the fragility and volatility of the global market itself, which, of course, is portrayed as a fait accompli. Thus there is simply no contextual platform for the author's analysis, and, despite the standard air of portent, no clear picture of what law and militarism can or might actually do in the near future, and we are left non the wiser about what the course of history might actually BE. This work is fairly indicative of the mainstream American understanding of history; my advice is that they take a break from making it, or we are all in big trouble 
 The binocs are really nice and sharp, but you can purchase just as good for less. The eye pieces were difficult to get used to, but for viewing I really like them. Camera is absolutely disappointing.  I have not taken the first clear image. The shutter is at the top and makes taking a photo quite awkward for someone with small hands.  I tried different cards, in case the write speed was blurring the image. No difference in quality. I used a prop and snapped a photo, and image was still unclear. Played around with settings and still no good results.  I would not recommend this as a camera AT ALL.   To help with your decision, please view submitted photo. If your needs require better clarity than the submitted photo, think again. This was taken at noon on a cloudy day. 3 Megapixels. Please identify the bird inside the airbrushed red circle.  So, for example: if you're searching for an Ivory Billed Woodpecker, you'd better choose more wisely - cause there's no way anyone at Cornell is going to accept this as scientific proof.  Bird in photo is a Red Bellied Woodpecker, which is approx. 9". I am about 70 - 80 feet away. 66 ft is minimum focal distance.  Hope this helps. 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 We have designed most of our kitchen around the KitchenAid red.  We thought in the pictures that this breadbox would match, so we bought it.  It does not match that color very well but the real reason we returned it was because it was so cheaply made.  It felt like it was ready to fall apart when we pulled it our of the box.  The lid did not move freely.  We ended up returning it and getting an all stainless box for $10 less that was much better built and looked better 
 First I will say that JAK was not previously on my must buy list and judging from this book she will not be there any time in the near future.  For me, the characters were undeveloped and uninteresting and at many times annoying.  I didn't even like the dog and I have now been informed over and over that jogging will ruin my knees.  The mystery part of the book seemed almost like it was thrown in as a second thought and made absolutely no sense.  I thoroughly enjoy a well-developed romantic mystery but this is certainly not one.  I might give JAK another chance sometime but hopefully I have helped save someone's time with this title. 
 This is a book that could (should?) have faded into history without being a great loss to the world. Yes, there are a few interesting bits of political philosophy, but they're far and few between, and mainly either just thrown out as Montesquieu's personal opinions with little to no evidence or examination, or flimsily based on historical examples. As a reader, I didn't find most of his arguments (where he didn't seem to be contradicting himself, which happens frequently) very convincing. This was obviously written with the 18th century French salon crowd in mind, and reads as such. I'm sure it provided a lot of aristocrats with conversation fodder to make them appear intelligent and educated at the time, but these days it just seems like an antiquated bit of history.  He claims the book has to be read as a whole to see the structure and his overall goal; well, I did read the whole book and at the end couldn't see an overarching structure at all. The work just seemed like a long, rambling, unorganized mess. The only people I might really recommend this to are people interested in Greek, Roman, and French history (especially legal history), but not to people interested in political science or philosophy.  Bump this one to the bottom of your list of classics on historical thought, there are much more interesting reads out there 
 I have read Liar's Poker, and Bombardiers, you are no Liar's Poker. Not even close. The characters are poorly developed, the dialogue is uneven, the scenarios are utterly and completely unrealistic. All in all, an incredibly painful read. If you haven't read Liar's Poker and are considering reading this book, read Liar's Poker instead; if you have already read Liar's Poker and are considering reading this book, read Liar's Poker again. It's that bad 
 This was a required textbook for a graduate-level project management class I am taking.  Unfortunately, it is full of mathematical errors (Our professor pointed out 4 errors during one class session alone!). The other major downfall to the book is that it is heavily skewed toward an engineering perspective of project management and does not consider a business approach.  I have had better financial textbooks explain formulas to use when calculating future and present value of cash flows in a more straightforward manner than this book.  If you must buy this book, buy it used and save a few dollars. 
 I am totally disappointed by this feature.  I cant believe that after the excellent quality of Toy Stories and other Pixar movies, they come out with this 4-color cheap feature of Buzz Lightyear.  I really dont understand what happened.  When I got the tape and watched it the first time, I was wondering if it is a bootlegged copy, or was it made in china or what...  I cant believe it, I cant believe also all the high ratings above!!.. 
 I borrowed this book from a friend after she gave it a great review. I was hopeful at the beginning, but the book dragged on and I had to force myself to finish it. It was very immature, poorly written, and the plot was all over the place. By the middle of the book you knew what was going to happen, and I couldn't wait to finish it. Not worth the time or money.. skip this one and read an original not set in NYC Chick Lit Book 
 I was expecting simple daily meal plans and it was a lot of reading and recipes that are not always food items on hand.  I was really disappointed in the book 
 It's hard to be too hard on this pretentious wad of snarling anti-reason, bleary new-age fog, wishful thinking, truely impressive ignorance of the genuine diversity of aboriginal cultures everywhere, or the centrality of Western science and reason to any successful human(e) endeavor in today's world. This book is an achievement of sorts -- many tin-type pictures; an out-of-date bibliography; an angry and assertive posture characteristic of the most herniated PC hype, guaranteed to appeal to a certain "cultivated" mindset; nice drawings and maps. This book is typical of current POMO (post-modernist) "historical" nonsense in a pretty package, a pastiche of the visually appealing with the intellectually bankrupt. Bruce Chatwin redux. 
 I've been a Sandra Brown fan for many years - and still am - however, I'm glad I borrowed this from the library rather than buy the hardback.  This was definitely not her best work.  Try your library first 
          Everyone has heard about that right? Creed was sued by their own fans for playing crappy live shows ahahaha! It would be really difficult to find a rock album that sucks more than this. Seriously, if you ever feel the desire to buy this piece of garbage, please rethink it and buy the albums that these guys are ripping off and pilfering from. Anything by Pearl Jam or other early nineties rock act would be great. Collectively, we can make America a place where talentless losers like Creed don't become stars with their awful music 
 Well, I read this "gem" because my 8th grader had to for class. Was the pig-rape scene or the graphic butchery of a beloved pet the most disgusting part?  I guess it's supposed to show  historical life in rural Vermont but I sure could have lived without it.  "Becoming a Man"?? There are far better books out there than this that can fit that bill. Long before my daughter remembers any "lessons" of this book, I'm sure the lingering descriptions of the rivers of blood and stench will stick with her. Plus, inbetween the great lessons we got about pig farming/butchery it's a pretty dull story. 
 Biggest waste of $35 I've ever seen ! This was a required text in school , and approximatly 25% of the formulas were completely unusable. It was if this character wrote these recipes off the top of his head without the  slightest concern for whether they worked or not.I shudder to think how  many copies of this waste of paper have been sold to culinary students and  the general public alike 
 First off, this title is not right. It would be better if called "Best Of" because KCi and JoJo only had three significant hits and those were "All My Life" Crazy" and "Tell Me It's Real." "All My Life" was one of the best R&B ballads to come out of the late 90's, but the other two resembled pale imitations that revealed the duo desperately trying to live up to that monster single. They succeeded someone considering both singles got pretty decent airplay ,but nothing will ever top "All My Life 
 We were expecting MORE of a cushion-feel to this seat, but all its really made of is a mesh fabric with little wires inside it to keep air flow moving.  It would be okay to keep your butt cool maybe, but for a cushion, its flat and cheap feeling.  As for "king size" it barely covers our car's seat...we ended up returning them...not worth it.. 
 It was difficult to assign a "star rating" for this book. It is a classic, for sure. It's definately a good book. However, I don't think I'd recommend it for most readers, and hence the low rating.  Like all of Knuth's "Art of Programming" books, this one is really starting to age. Like other reviewers, I really don't like the MIX assembly examples. (MIX is a fictional computer that he invented purely for the purpose of teaching.) His rationale for using MIX is because he says that he doesn't want to just discuss topics in theory, sometimes it's necessary to show how it's actually implemented. He does this in MIX. He says that he chose MIX, rather than any actual existing machine language, so that it wouldn't be out of date or be tied to a particular platform. Unfortuanetly, there are several problems with the MIX examples:  * First, it's assembly language. I used to do lots of assembly language. (I make video games.) Now I do almost none at all. In general, very few programmers do assembly language programming. I understand how in many cases using a high-level language could possibly have glossed over some of the details. However, still, I think a language like C is sufficiently low level that he could have acheived the same results with C, and it would have been much more readable and accessible to today's audience.  Also, when Knuth wrote his first books, C was just being born, and since then, it has become a lingua franca in the computer science community.  * MIX is purposely contrived to be "weird" (6-bit word size???)  * Most importantly, using a fictious computer system introduces an unnecessary extra step to understanding the examples. Not only do you have to learn the material, but you have to wade through learning MIX - information you won't use anywhere else. I know that any of C, Java, Pascal, x86, MIPS, etc would have had people who didn't know that language and so it would have been an impediment to them. Unfortunatly, Knuth has chosen a language that NOBODY knows and so EVERYBODY has this extra learning curve.  The books are also really heavy on the math. I think it's not unfair to say that these books are more math books than they are computer books. Knuth is famous for setting computer science on a mathematical foundation. He proves everything and RIGOROUSLY discusses the math behind every topic. For some readers, this is enlightening. Now I am not shy on math (I wrote a book on 3D math myself) however I usually found the detailed proofs unnecessary. I also wish he would have expressed ideas in English more that equations. For example, Knuth would never write "the elements sum to one" - instead, he'd have an equation using sigma notation. Which is consise and precise and in some sense "elegent" - but it takes a lot of mental "work" to read. I think many readers will share this sentiment.  Some people include the phrase "the information is timeless."  Yeah, this is true.  But the presentation style is not.  There other books with the same "timeless" information, and a more up-to-date style of presentation.  I personally use Sedgewick's algorithm's book.  An interesting anecdote on how much I have been actually able to use this book - perhaps it will help you estimate if you will get enough use out of it to justify the price tag. We discovered that the rand() function in the C library on the PS2 was buried underneath several layers of funtion calls and checks for different random number modes, etc, and it was causing a performance problem, and we needed to write a replacement. I was thrilled. Finally, an opportunity to pull the Knuth off the shelf! This book is one of the the bibles on random numbers. I looked for advice on chosing A and C for the linear congruential generator. There was SOOOO much information. (The first 190 pages of the 2nd volume deal with random numbers.) It was all very facinating. Yet in the end, we dug up the gcc source for rand() and just used the numbers they chose!   
 Amazon forces you to put at least one star to review an item, but these phones don't even earn that.  Our 10-year old $18 kmart phones were wearing out, but are way better than these Unidens.  Hissing, crackling static, and the volume of the person on the other end suddenly changes, from ok to inaudible.  We tried various things suggested in the manual.  They didn't interfere with our wireless internet or anything, but we haven't been able to have a single conversation on these-- always end up at the old corded phone.  The ringer is piercing and annoying on the loud setting, and just annoying at the low volume setting (nothing in between).  At least with the string and soup cans, the bad volume is constant.  These are going back to the store 
 Maberry's Ghost Road Blues is, as fellow author Scott Nicholson says on the jacket blurb,"chilling,lyrical,and melodic." It reads more like poetry than narrative throughout. Maberry obviously has the chops as a writer. I truly wish that I could write with his gift for description and cadence. So, why only two stars? Because this may be the single most irritating piece of work that I have read in years. Maberry seems to think that there are only three kinds of people in the world who are not impotent fools. 1. Evil people-These folks are imbued with superhuman capabilities that the poor ordinary rubes that populate this author's world are incapable of defending themselves against (See Mark Guthrie in GRB. He makes Boy George look like John Wayne.). 2. Martial arts practitioners-This group has found the Holy Grail of self-defense, even against the people in category 1. (See Malcom Crow in GRB. If this guy was anymore heroic, he'd live under a mansion and have a 'Bat Phone'.) All the while Maberry writes about Crow's heroics with no sense of irony or black humor. No, sorry, Crow's juvenile attempts at humor do not qualify. Maberry actually believes this bilge. And finally, number 3. Cops-Maberry's obvious worship of all things police almost borders on the erotic.In this author's world, we are all helpless wusses unless we fall in to one of these three categories. Frankly, as a man, I don't care to be considered a spineless pansy if I don't happen to be evil or a cop (especially one who knows jiu jitsu). It's the perpetuation of lies such as these that have made people give up many of their freedoms and means of defense to an ever increasing police state. That so many people have been taught over the years by the self-serving Maberrys of the world to sit on their hands, or cower in fear, when faced with danger is the reason things like 9-11 could happen. In Maberry's world, only highly trained government officials (an oxymoron, I know) are capable of fighting evil. The rest of the men wait for a 110 pound girl in a police uniform to come rescue them. Jonathan, you're an excellent writer, but your biases betray you. If you had put your skills to better work, I'd eagerly buy the next two installments of your trilogy. As it is, I'll pass. Your world view is a harmful one in my opinion, but you're welcome to it. But, given your talent, it's a shameful waste. 
 Willy Wonka meets Dr. Strangelove in this one-of-a-kind cinematic disaster. Barry Levinson's longtime "dream project" emerges as a garish nightmare. The impressive production design wears out its welcome after five minutes while a talented cast sinks in the big-budget quagmire. Another unfilmable concept that somehow received the Hollywood green light 
 I went through three lessons before canning this CD.  The lessons were terrible!  Sometimes they stated the French word before the English word and sometimes afterward, which meant you could be learning the wrong word!  The pronounciations were nowhere near the way the French speak; they were like what a HS French teacher who'd learned from a book and never been to France would speak 
 Great first book, The RM was great, but this is just the half-hearted ranting of an overrated crybaby. Obviously, Goad is a man with only one book in him, given underground credibility either b/c he spent time in prison for beating his wife or because he lives in Portland, sucking off the warm dung-squirting teat of Chuck Palahniuk 
 The book does contain SOME good information. That is as far as I will go. Every review failed to mention that the diagrams require a magnifying glass to read. I would assume that every reviewer had 20/20 vision but I know my wife does and she needed a magnifying glass to read the diagrams as well. It is littered with errors. One such is on page 63 "Did you notice relationship 5 is marked with an asterisk". I would like to know where the asterisk is, magnifying glass or not on any page. The book and reviews fail to spell out you better have Visio 2000 and Access 2000 to follow along. That aside from everything else the book never states that Visio 2000 and Access 2000 are what are used, it is assumed. You know what they say about assume. For a begginers book and the lack of editing I give it a "D". For general information about databases I give it a "C". I would say better luck next time but I would not drop another dime on a book written by this author. I hope he makes a better Attorney than an author 
 The Panasonic CD player has a good sound quality, but does not automatically change from one CD to the next. It requires manual switching via the remote control to change from one CD to another. This feature was not explicitly stated in the specifications, and is misleading to a buyer who is seeking continuous playing of all five CD's 
 Deadline follows the two-year fictitious journey of IS project manager Webster Tompkins, illustrating the lessons he learns along the way. I bought this book primarily due to the great reviews it garnered on Amazon.com. After all, you can't go wrong when a book rates 4.5 out of 5 stars from over 25 readers, can you? Yep. This book was terrible, because of two very big problems: the book didn't say very much in 300+ pages and what it did say I don't agree with (it also tends to contradict much of Tom Peter's 'In Search of Excellence'). Or, to state it another way, the book points out about five very useful lessons/pieces of information, but takes forever to do so. Those lessons could have been summarized in about five pages--with compelling examples.  
 These movies are just total nonsensical rubbish about mutated babies.  From a horror movie fan's perspective, I remain completely unimpressed with the merits of these films and that includes the original, "It's Alive".  The only thing about babies (mutated or not) that scares me is having to change their diapers...it stinks and this entire trilogy stinks too!  What a worthless...waste 
 You loved Ender's Game, right?  And even though the next couple of Ender-related books were more confusing and not of the same quality as Ender's Game, at last came Ender's Shadow, the parallel story of Bean.  Terrific.  Then came Shadow of the Hegemon.  It is, literally, a shadow of the original talent and quality of the first five books.  The dialogue is tedious, the story line pencil thin, and the plot has a huge Achilles' heel (pun intended).  This is another example of a book out by an author (in this case Orson Scott Card) who must have been pressured to produce, because this baby needs more cooking.  It will make no sense if you haven't read Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow.  It hardly makes any sense at all.  Beware 
 This book proports to be a serious expose of a vast conspiracy involving the space program.  The landings and moonwalks that we watched worldwide were, according to the authors, faked on a very earthbound set.  To backup this claim they offer a vast array of evidence and theories about those involved and the reasons for this deception. Some examples are:  The 'evidence':   The shadows on the photographs do not line up if there is only one light source, as there would be on the moon.  The authors do not allow for the light reflecting off various surfaces or the fact that while the lunar surfaces are described as flat they are not completely flat, small dips, bumps and slopes exist and would effect the shadows.  The Motivation:  The Moon program was a means to take public attention from Vietnam (although elsewhere in the book the authors claim that this started during WWII or before).    The Consipracy:   The conspirators, according to the authors, include all the astronauts, NASA, various members of the government, Department of Defense, the Russian space program, large portions of the British government and astromonical community, movie technicians, and author Arthur C. Clarke to name only a few.  Very little explanation is given to how all these people have been kept quiet all this time.  Other clues to this conspiracy are present, according to the authors, in various press releases, interviews, movies, and STAR TREK episodes.  The authors present this evidence in a very unprofessional fashion, they state their points, embellished with many exclaimation points, scatter about boxes with collaborating points decorated with cute little headlines.  This is made even more annoying when some of the 'points' are well known bits of historical fact and the sideboxes contain illrelevancies like British nursery rhymes.   The authors find connections between the Apollo program and the clandestine entrance of scientists from Nazi Germany, Roswell and other UFO incidents, crop circles, ley lines, pyramids, Stonehenge, intervention from aliens in the constuction of the solar system and many other unlikely events.  They identify relationships between many mathematical measures but do not take into consideration that many measurements are purely arbitary and by no means universal even among humans much less any other civilizations, and therefore 'relationships' involving miles, hours, days, etc are only concidences and not clues to a higher truth.  By the time I reached the end of this book I was waiting for the authors to include Atlantis, Free Masons, the Knights Templar and perhaps Big Foot.    This is to be read for entertainment purposes only.  The research involved here bears the same relationship to serious scholarship that jelly beans do to vegetables.  
 As a big proponent of a manned mission to Mars, I looked forward to reading this book.  While Baxter's characters showed a lot of promise, the slow pace of the story and lack of any possible conflict failed to keep my interest 
 Bill, when will you just die?  if you read this feel free to email me evan.fett@gmail.co 
 This brand was my 2nd Delonghi thermal carafe model in 2 months, after the first one broke after 5 weeks.  This one worked wonderfully for about 4 weeks until one morning.  I came in and found coffee all over the counter.  I thought I had not aligned the pot properly or something.  After another week of dealing with this, the electrical system shorted out due to all the coffee spills.  This coffee maker made the best coffee and the carafe kept it hot all day.  I don't know what happened and we couldn't get it resolved.  We purchased a Cuisinart with a 3 yr warranty (not the one that grinds coffee) and has worked great for 6 weeks 
 Didn't like this book. I wanted to read a Baltimore writer since I live near there. 
 I purchased this coffeemaker for my boyfriend. When I opened the box you could tell that the item had already been removed. When I took the coffeemaker out, to my surprise, there were still grounds in the filter area. Needless to say I was disappointed that I received a "used" coffeemaker. I promptly returned the coffeemaker and purchased another at a local store 
 This was my first Catherine Coulter book and my last.  MAYBE, the author was trying to portray life during those times, but rape scenes between the hero & heroine isn't exactly what I'd call romantic...  One other little quirk I had was during her pregnancy...so..her husband pushed her down like a boulder, got stabbed in the side by a knife in the process, husband's ex-lover kicked her in the belly during a cat fight, fell off a cliff and hanging down on that cliff and STILL managed to keep the baby!?!?!   Nothing made sense in the entire book.. from the characters, to the plots, and to the title...nothing made sense! Like one reader was saying, its so bad its good 
 Like another reviewer said, there are a ton of made up names in this book.  The lists in the front are bizzare, and quite often end somewhere around M in alphabetical order - like there was some arbitrary list and she ran out of room for more variety. Reading through all the names with my husband last night, we just kept looking at each other with quizzical expressions on our faces. It felt like even the author got bored creating her own lists. If you really need to look at this book, get it from the library - don't waste your money 
 This book is about child abuse and killing women.  The werewolf aspect is incidental.  Painful book.  Do not buy it 
 I love books by Don Aslett and so I was really happy to see that he'd written another on on efficiency.  This book is lilterally an old book published with a new cover.  If you have read his book, How to Have a 48 Hour Day, you have already read this book.  The other reviewer mentioned this, but I thought he meant that Aslett was just using the same concepts.  No, he published the same book with a new cover.  An honest writer would have made this clear.  It is very unlike Aslett to be deceptive, but he has been now 
 The history is very, very slow in developing and basically the whole book is noneventful. JB is sent to Bologna and the he came back. Period. Some people apparently wanted him dead! At least that's what Grisham tell us from the start, but then simply nothing happen.  But the most annoying thing - being myself italian - is to read so many mistakes in the parts of book written in Italian!! You fun readding this review? Notto really, I thinko but maybe picture the now you have how of italians parts off Brokker like sound 
     A literary cottage industry was spawned nearly twenty years ago with the publication of  "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" by Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh. The outstanding example of its output is "The DaVinci Code," in which the story has been even further dumbed down for popular consumption. While Tracy Twyman's "The Merovingian Mythos" is not quite as abysmally bad, it is representative of the genre. It takes a handful of historical facts (some of which are quite fascinating), relates them to literature and legend (again, often having considerable interest) and leavens them with a great deal of speculation, myth, and, one suspects, wishful thinking. It is entirely typical of the attitude that permeates so much of our society, whereby facts (whether they be intelligence reports from the middle east, economic data, or whatever) are selected to fit their consumer's desires and prejudices. Sad to say, there are many people who would rather believe in fairy tales than in humdrum realities.      The failing of all the "Merovingian mythos" books is that they do not face genealogical facts. As we trace our ancestry back from the present generation, each generation of ancestors doubles in number. Thus, every person has two parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, and so on. There are today about sixty generations separating us from the time of the semi-legendary Merovingian progenitor who is variously called Meroveus, Merovech, or Merovée. Accordingly, the typical middle-aged adult of the early twenty-first century has ancestors at that period numbering approximately two to the sixtieth power. This number is, of course, many times the number of people actually living in Europe during the fifth century A.D., so there is much repetition of ancestral lines. Accordingly all people of European descent have many ancestors in common.      In such works on genealogy as Roderick Stuart's "Royalty for Commoners," Frederick Lewis Weis's "Ancestral Roots of Certain American Colonists," and Gary Boyd Roberts's "The Royal Descents of 600 Immigrants to the American Colonies," documented lineages having living representatives may be followed all the way back to the Merovingians. For example, in Stuart's book one may find lineages back to Merovech through Charlemagne, through Charlemagne's wife Hildegarde of Swabia, through Hugh "le Méfiant," and through Regnier "Longhals." The last-named of these goes through Adela, the daughter of the doomed Dagobert II, thus encompassing virtually the complete Merovingian line.   A relatively large number of people exist who can prove they descend through at least one of these lines, some through all four, and often with much duplication. This number is dwarfed by that of the descendants who are completely unaware of their ancestry.       Even if the fanciful theories advanced in "Holy Blood, Holy Grail" and elaborated in "The Merovingian Mythos" were all true, just what would it mean? That perhaps more than half of all people of north European descent were descended from a) Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalen; b) Jews of ancient Palestine; c) Sumerian god-kings? And what would any of these prove?       The study of genealogy is rewarding because it yields a personalized acquaintance with history. For example, the revolutionary battle of King's Mountain, or the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, somehow have more significance to me because ancestors of mine were there. Shortly after I was able to prove a line to Charlemagne, I was able to pick up Ariosto's "Orlando furioso" with a bit more interest than I had in it three decades ago in college. It adds a certain dimension to know that one is descended from the saintly Margaret, queen of Scotland, or from Fredegonde, whom Stuart identifies as one of the most bloodthirsty women in history.       We are a mixed-up race, descended from saints and sinners, heroes and villains, and none of these facts changes in the least who we are or what we do in life, unless we are inspired (or repelled) by their examples. I would far rather study a well-documented work of genealogy, with the literary classics and a good historical reference like the eleventh edition of the Encylopædia Britannica close at hand, than any number of pseudo-histories such as "The Merovingian Mythos."   
 Free radicals are bad for you because they are molecules that destroy your cellas and promote ageing and sickness. Wow.   Unfortunately it would seem the evil stuff is everywhere so there is no real escaping our sad certainity of ageing and decay.  Mostly it goes like that. One actually useful bit of info: avoid salami, sausages and the like.  We get more substance once one reaches the inevitable My Recipies part. Let's see. OK, you are supposed to eat a little salad for lunch, a small piece of chicken for lunch with some veggies, and so on.  Yeah right. You probably will lose some weight.  Yawn 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 I first read the Dance Hall of the Dead in high school.  Being a member of the Zuni Tribe, and a resident of the town of Zuni, it was quite interesting to see how much of the information concerning Zuni could be changed to fit the "theme" and plot of the book.  While these may seem like little details to most people, it is quite disturbing to see how often Hillermans work is seen as accurate, because of a reputation he has somehow gained as an "expert" on Native Cultures of the American Southwest.  Apparently, he thought that all pueblo people are the same.  This is evident in the use of the last name of Cata, which is not even seen in Zuni, and is actually a last name seen only in the Rio Grande Pueblos.  In addition, his interpretation or portrayal of the Sha'la'k'o ceremony as a "Dance Hall of the Dead" is simplistic at best.  While he may be an "expert" in Navajo culture, it does not qualify him to comment on a COMPLETELY different society, much less its sacred and complex kachina ceremonies.  Finally, many native people, such as the Navajo, the Zuni and the Hopi (who have all been "featured" in Hillerman's books) feel that Hillerman's descriptions of ceremonies and rituals is just plain wrong.  As an outsider, he has no business delving into or exposing the nature of such things as kachinas, which we consider sacred yet dangerous.  Furthermore, by exploiting our cultures for the sake of adding interest to a plot, he seems to show a lack of respect for our cultures, our religions, and our tribes in general.   This in itself is bad enough, but the worst thing is that people actually consider his novels definitive descriptions of Native culture.  There are many ethnological works out there that are available, and they are NOT hard to find.  After all Zuni is one of, if not THE most complex, and most studied society on earth.  While I don't agree with people wanting to know "everything there is to know" about Zuni culture, there are much better places to find out about "us" than a Tony Hillerman book 
 This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there 
 Bought this about a year ago and now it has a lens cap error (appears like the shutter never opens) and will not record video.  Spoke with JVC and they seemed to know that this is a problem and are having me send it in.  Will update my rating after I see what is wrong, if they can fix it, if they will stand behind their product.  Watch for more details.  Before it failed only complaint I had was it was a little flakey with lighting but otherwise worked okay for the price 
 I read this book desperate for ideas on how to deal with night wakings, and I did not find it helpful. The information is very general and is presented in a disorganized fashion. I had to look in 5 different sections  to answer my question, and each only contained short blurbs on the subject.  Almost every page of this book has a box with a tip or answered question,  and although the advice seems sound, the format is distracting and  difficult to follow. I much preferred Ferber's "Solve Your Child's  Sleep Problems". His answers were more concrete and arranged in a  readable fashion. He provided detailed charts to help you manage things  like how long to let a baby cry, how to water down bottles for night  feedings, or change the sleep cycle of an early riser. I also preferred  Weissbluth's "Health Sleep Habits, Happy Child", which offered a  lot of moral support on why it's best for your child to correct sleep  problems early. He also spends a lot of time talking about daytime naps in  detail. And both authors say it's fine to nurse a baby to sleep (as long as  there are no other sleep problems), which for some reason the AAP is  totally against. I would not recommedn this book 
 The movie is a about a guy, who does a lot of work and no fun and then feels sorry about that. That's pretty much the whole story. Well, the idea is quite powerful but not new, the characters are done in the "comics" style and very primitive, the jokes are quite boring.   Actually what is really amazing, that it could've been ok to watch as a family movie, but a few really tasteless jokes made it PG13 rated without adding any fun, so the movie about family values is not appropriate for kids.  Too boring for adults, not appropriate for kids, too much moral for young crowd - I can't really think who might like it 
 I liked his first the best, I never liked this CD much. The new one "awake" is even worse 
 I just returned from a trip to NC for furniture having purchased this book as a guide.  As it turned out, the book was not very helpful and I wasted a lot of time by relying on its recommendations.  For starters, it's very outdated and the author's website for updates is no longer online.  Many of the recommendations are based on the author's personal opinions without explanations that readers could use to judge for themselves.  She lists her favorite stores and downplays others without providing a basis for her reasoning. Much of the information provided on the various dealers is straight out of the stores' marketing materials.   There are a few useful tips scattered through the book but overall it wasn't very helpful. As far as whether NC is worth the trip- it IS, but only if you are already looking to buy very high quality name brand furniture (pieces that typically are special ordered in your pick of fabrics and finishes).  NC is not a great place to go if you're shopping primarily based on budget.  You aren't going to find very low priced furniture, but if you were already prepared to pay $4000 for a leather Natuzzi couch from a local retailer, it's worth the trip to save 40% on it.  If budget is your most important criteria, you're better off at IKEA or a local retailer that carries lesser known manufacturers catering to a lower price point.  Just from personal experience, we did great at Furnitureland South- AMAZING selection and service in one stop.  This author had little good to say about FLS but her hands-down favorite- Rose Furniture- was a total bomb- rotten service, cramped showroom and so-so selection 
 Whyte fails to reconcile the tasks of writing both a dispassionate philosophical text and a popular and amusing account of faulty thinking. More concern should have been given to make sure asides and irreverent statements were commensurate with the books broader objectives. For example he states:  '...as for policemen and priests, well, let us just charitably say that they are not all bigots or pederasts'.  This is a merely a crass flippant comment implying, without recourse to sound argument or evidence, that the majority of policemen and priests are bigots. The most questionable example is when Whyte is so pleased with his wit and insight in exposing a statistical miscalculation by the British Medical Association, that he comes perilously close to belittling the actual incidence of deaths of young women from anorexia. These lazy statements would be better suited to a tabloid columnist shooting from the hip than a supposedly ultra-rationalist philosopher.   In one section of the book Whyte also clearly betrays some of the principles that he strongly advocates. In a section which makes reference to the banning of the British blood sport foxhunting, he states that:  'Fox hunting clearly differs from fishing and shooting in some respects. For example, it is practised primarily by wealthy non-Labour voters on horseback and is hated by left-wing members of the Labour Party who often feel Mr Blair does too little for them.'  However, fox hunting also differs from fishing and shooting in that it is the most visible and ritualistic of blood sports in this country. It should also be obvious that different animals are also hunted under each sport. For example, a crucial distinction between hunting and fishing is that the target of the hunt, the fox, is a mammal. Its mammalian brain includes a limbic system: this is linked with sophisticated emotional states, attachment to offspring, and also a greater capacity to suffer from fear and torment than a fish, which has a relatively simple reptilian brain. So perhaps there are some differences between blood sports that are distinct from the internal machinations of the Labour Party.   However, the key point is that Whyte contradicts an argument he makes earlier in the book. He argues against the motive fallacy:  'The announcement of a new policy is greeted, not with a discussion of its alleged merits, but with a flurry of speculation from journalists and political opponents regarding the politician's motives for announcing it. He wants to appease the left-wing of his party, or curry favour with middle-England...'  But Whyte blatantly lapsed into this fallacy when focusing on Tony Blair's motives for banning hunting.  It's faulty thinking when someone else does it, but when Whyte can't perceive any sound ethical basis to a policy then it's obviously OK to go right ahead and appeal to extraneous motives. He can't see any difference between fishing, shooting and hunting (so there clearly can't be any) so in this instance it's appropriate to commit the motive fallacy. This gives the impression that Whyte is as prone to faulty thinking as the rest of us. 
 I came to this book after having seen it referenced in a number of more general books with chapters on cellular automata. The book describes numerous experiments in varying levels of detail that are suitable for running on cellular automata. The example experiments are both abstract (`Life' or `Parity' rules) and concrete (simulation of physical systems). Little attention is paid to simulating either social or biological processes. There is a lot here but the level of detail is poor. Many explanations of the simulations assume considerable knowledge of the physical systems being simulated or the weaknesses of other approaches that may used. The greatest weakness of this book is that it relies on a specific hardware implementation of a CA machine. All examples require this machine (a PC card) to be installed in your PC in order to run. This card appears to no longer be available (no supplier details are given in the book). The use of Forth (a language using reverse polish notation) to describe rules and the reliance on specific hardware makes the rules discussed difficult to implement on a software CA. The rules presented in the second half of the book are so tied to the hardware implementation of the unavailable PC card as to be impossible to translate directly into English-like rules. This is a definite dud 
 Jane Smiley's _A_Thousand_Acres_ had a great deal of potential.  It had a powerful plot (King Lear) that has been little-adapted in modern times.  Smiley chose an interesting and rich setting in her modern day heartland farm.  However, the actual execution of the book leaves much to be desired.  First and foremost, Smiley writes exactly like a writer who has just completed a college writing program.  She uses smart and subtle humor (one may say wit), metaphors and similes.  The problem is that one is conscious at each and every juncture that she is using a simile, a metaphor, or a quip.  While more seasoned writers might have woven beauty into readable text or else have chosen to complexify and engage a reader, instead she chose a middleground that is neither challenging nor readable.  The reader constantly is forced to swallow some rather ridiculous metaphors, all the while conscious that they are swallowing a textbook, but ridiculous, metaphor.  And while the plot taken from Shakespeare had a lot of potential, it was handled quite inexpertly.  Yes, Smiley chose the intelligent path and abandoned Lear about 3/4 of the way through (so that everyone doesn't die).  However, once again, she writes in a way that makes every reader -conscious- that she is adapting Shakespeare, and at times the plot seems ridiculous in its current setting.  Yes, she sheds new light (the protagonist is the Goneril-character, who was a Shakespearean antagonist) in a very intriguing way.  Yes, she invents new excuses for her behavior (former child abuse)... however, had she not tried so hard to make the reader conscious that she was adapting Shakespeare, these plausable interpretations might not have seemed -in-plausable.  All in all, a book with many potent seeds that were not sown to anything near their full value 
 I liked his first couple of albums, they were funny, creative, and displayed luda's real talent. While this CD has luda on it, it has more of the other performers, and none of them are even near luda in terms of talent. Luda is pretty funny on this album, but it seems that his last couple of cds have been getting worse and worse. If you really like ludacris, then get "Word of Mouf" or "Back for the First Time". If you absolutely love those albums, then get this one and his other two. If you just find them decent, then stop right there 
 I read this book, it was okay but the story flashed back to much, and I couldn't folow all of it but I read all of it anyway. I wouldn't recommend it. TOO SLOW MOVING, and BORING because of the flashbacks. The movie was the same way 
 I am a prolific reader of historical novels, so when I saw "Antiquity" by Norman Cantor, I was intrigued.  Inside the covers, however, lies one of the worst researched, terribly opinionated, and worse, outright disingenuous books purporting to be historical analysis I have ever read.  One could chalk this up to a novice's first attempt, but Cantor is a well known author with his work on Medieval life.  Perhaps, under a rush of a deadline he forgot that history is supposed to be told truthfully.  He skewers or ignores facts, presents blantantly opinionated views which leave a novice reader with a wholly untruthful view of what happened, and provides no documentation of research for his outlandish postulations (presented as fact) of actions, locales or politics which he covers.  My greatest concern, is that there are what apperared to me to be several anti-Semetic references or characterizations, several disparaging remarks of middle-eastern cultures, and an haughty presentation of the Macedonian Empire's world view. Has Cantor lectured so long that he thinks the whole world are easily intimidated as his 18-22 year old audiences?    If you are wanting to know about ancient history, this book isn't for you.  If truthfulness doesn't matter, well then, you might enjoy what really is a self-aggrandizing doorstop 
 It's always interesting to read a Marxist view of anything to get a vastly different perspective from the usual liberal and conservative views (and the few moderate views that manage to find their way into print).    At bottom, the problem with the news media, according to McChesney, is that it's not far enough to the Left!  He rejects the criticism of the media's liberal bias.  This rejection is based on an eccentric use of the term "liberal".  For instance, Bill Clinton and Al Gore are "moderate to conservative Democrats" (p. 102).  "The Left" consists of radicals and "social democrats". (p. 103)  He sees both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton as "neoliberals": "with the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan, the neoliberal moment had commenced.  Neoliberal ideology became hegemonic not only among Republicans but also in the Democratic Party of Bill Clinton, Al Gore and Joseph Lieberman."  (p. 49)  McChesney opposes professionalism in journalism, because professionalism "is a journalism of fact without regard to" a political ideology. (p. 67).  "The claim that it is possible to provide neutral and objective news" is suspect. (p. 68)  Professionalism refuses "to place every important issue in a larger political ideology." (p. 71)    He deplores the influence of corporations on news broadcasting (Don't we all?), but he also deplores NPR and PBS: "NPR and PBS at a national level tend to provide a bland variant of mainstream and conventional journalism" (p. 245).  So, the root problem is that even NPR and PBS are not far enough to the Left!    He wants unlimited funding of these public media without any overseeing or accountability.  (Perhaps a Constitutional Amendment--although he doesn't actually propose such a thing or say how this would otherwise be achievable.)  One wonders why he is so sanguine that he would be happy with a public news broadcasting source that was not answerable to anybody.  Is it because he assumes that it would be run by insiders who share his Marxist views?  He would certainly not be happy with it otherwise.  (See, in this connection, the film "Shattered Glass".)  Bottom line: Skip this book and buy Don't Blame the People or Freedom of the Press--for Whom?   
 The author does a good job expressing her difficulty in being a Jew and a Buddhist, and then tries to squeeze in a few ideas that try to bring the two together. I have studied Judaism for many years and I can say that she doesn't really know much about Authentic Judaism all she knows is what a Jew is in the modern western world, but that is not true Judaism.  True authentic Judaism doesn't have to be forced into symmetry with Buddhism, it is readily apparent how both traditions come from the same source and flow beautifully together. What is needed is for someone to explain what Judaism is. There is a wonderful book that just came out and I strongly recommend it for anyone who wants to find out about this subject. I promise you wont be disappointed.  It is a conversation between a Torah Scholar (Akiva Tatz) and a Buddhist Jew (David Gottlieb) called "Letters to a Buddhist Jew."  Enjoy! 
 I first picked up on the Anita Blake series a little over a year ago. I was absolutely enthralled. Not only was the main character witty, intelligent, and kick-butt, but there was a memorable set of supporting characters to see her through. Who can forget Zerbrowski's antics (even in the worst of times) or the cold-hearted killing of everyone's favorite bounty hunter? After reading my share of the books and floating around to some of the other reviews here on Amazon, I am left wondering the same thing many of the other fans are: what happened?  I just finished Narcissus in Chains. Normally when I finish a book, I'm left with a sense of fulfillment, like I've accomplished something. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I've always found this series to capture me from the get-go, but trying to convince myself to read this one was hard. Not only was the plot rather weak, but Anita seemed to keep on debating the same situations over and over. Jean-Claude, Richard, Micah, and even Asher seem to plague her thoughts. And although she will do anything to save a member of her pard, or anyone else for that matter, her focus always seemed to drift back to the boys. And did anyone else notice the repetitiveness in the writing? Hamilton used the exact same wording for certain feelings or actions throughout the book. Unlike the earlier part of the series, the writing in Narcissus in Chains is less imaginative and less memorable. On top of it all, come the end of the book, we have this bad guy who I can't even remember where he came from in the first place!  My favorite part of the books has always been Anita's police work. I am honestly ten times more interested in her career than I am in her love life. I miss having a tight, intense plot that flows, instead of drifting around like some kid with a short attention span. And as pointed out in the book, the charming Anita Blake we used to know and love really has become a monster. A literary disaster of a monster.  Although the reviews for Cerulean Sins are probably just as grim as the reviews for Narcissus in Chains, I plan to go ahead and continue the series. I can't give up on something that has such great potential, and from the sound of it, this next one has a more recognizable plot. I can only hope. Unfortunately, I believe that Obsidian Butterfly was probably the last of one of the best series and best characters ever created 
 This is not a grasping enjoyable read....only if you are a true scholar interested in this subject content which I was; otherwise, the item would be returned. Not for mainstream readers...which is probably a loss for the reading community 
  I usually trust Amazon reviewers on movie reviews, but this time ....NO WAY!   This silly, totally predictable film left us playing with the cat for our evening entertainment, hoping the movie would liven up.  Sadly, it didn't. To those who rave about the film...you must be in another dimension or something.  Thumbs DOWN. 
 If you are looking for the novel, this isn't it.  The description does not indicate that this is nothing more than a fancy comic book.  I bought vol 1-3, returned all with a complaint, Amazon reordered for me and sent me the same thing again.  Finally got the novels from B&N for less.  Don't waste your money 
 Rarely do I give book rating of one star. Mainly because I don't know what that kind of rating exactly means. Does it mean that I didn't like the book? If so, what is the difference between one star and two stars. I guess it is hard to give argumentative explanation of ones own rating. So I won't. :)  What do I have in front of me?  This is something that advertises itself as a modern time macchiavelism. But, to say that this book has any kind of resemblance to "Il principe" is highly overstated. We are all aware (and if we are not, we should be) of methods described in this book. Methods that concern being promoted in any kind of job that you do. Method here being ruthlessnes, and most of all efficiency, wihtout feel for compassion and human realtions in any other kind than exploitment. It may sound as something that Macchiavlei said, it may even resemble Nietzschean philospohy, but precisely in that lies the point.   I fail to picture the reader of this book. I fail to see big corporate director who alreday doesen't know all that is written here and more, and quite frankly, I fail to see him reading at all, but that is another story. To average joe out there, who thinks that there are marvellous wonders and secrets written here this book will seem quite drab. After all, rutlessnes is not employment strategy, it is just a state of character. One who is not able to do such a thing won't be any different upon reading this book.  If you are looking for philosophy of modern times, there are tons of authors out there, of ages past that are presenting better work of modern times than any of the contemporary autors. Machiavelli being one of the better known.  Maybe I just don't want to accept the existance of the universe (which paradoxically I can tell for sure that is real) presented in this book, and maybe therein lies my angst, but that is for you to judge if you, by some twist of chance happen to stumble upon this book.   
 For the first time since buying a book on-line I was tempted to wrap it up and send it back, this book was that terrible. It went out of its way to avoid any negativity or criticism about the Koran or about Moslems, whether mainstream or fanatical. This is a very sanitized version of this holy book, and unobjective to the extreme.  I was searching for true meanings of the Koran elements but reading this version was a complete waste of time 
 As ridiculous as I found this book, upon reading reviews from so many men who loved it, I am filled with horror.  Granted, I am a female college student, so I completely missed the abused-male-baby-boomer boat, but I cross my fingers and wish like crazy that not all men have this sort of deep psychological complex. I find hope in a few reviews written by men who are still confident that they can be men without a self help book.   Everything that can be said about Bly's methods has been said.  He is not a psychologist.  He is not a folklorist.  He is a poet (that's what the two stars are for).  Folklore is dynamic, and to suppose the "Iron John" folktale is the same today as it was before the Grimms collected it is purely blind.  The Grimms slashed and edited and put in cute morals.  If you think the Granny they collected it from would have told the exact same "Iron John" tale as the woman two houses away, or ten years earlier, or two days later, you are a stranger to folklore.  Society holds on to the tales that mean something to us.  Isn't it curious then, that "Iron John" dropped from our stock of folktales until ressurrected by Bly, who suddenly claims it is a reflection of modern America? 
 After reading other Network+ books, I found this one to have  many errors. I thought it's test questions at the end of the chapters looked like they were going to be better training material. Big mistake. One answer tells you one thing and the very next answer contradicts what the previous one just stated. I also read Ron Gilster's Network+ for Dummies so you would think the material would contain the same information. The Dummies book tells you a Brouter is found in the Data Link and Network Layer, while this book says it's on the Physical and Data Link layer. Inconstistent information and it's definitely not worth the money I paid. This book will be returned 
 While I enjoyed certain aspects of this book, I found many of Angier's ideas to be completely outrageous and unsupported. A great example is her view on the evolution of women's breasts the reasoning she gives for their swelled permanence in human females.   She explains that women's breasts are pretty, flamboyant, irresistible sensory exploiters which fundamentally evolved by accident without considering and/or critiquing the issue from a social /political standpoint. She also presumes that the aesthetic breast is nonfunctional to the point of being counter functional, which is why (she feels) it strikes us as so beautiful.   She then goes on to compare the situation to that of Zebra finches in suggesting there is a neurophysiologic process in the female zebra finch's brain that serves some other, unknown purpose but that is easily co-opted and aroused by males white toques. The hat stimulates an extant neural pathway, and it lures the female, who knows only what she likes but not why This application of this theory to that of human beings lacks any substantial support since, unlike the Zebra finch, there is an absence of proof that men are born with a neurophysiologic process in their brain that causes arousal at the sight of breasts. I suppose it can't possibly have anything to do with social conditioning and centuries of pervasive man made images of the sexualized breast.  Remember pavlov's dogs who salivating at the sound of the bell? WEll, we tend to forget that human beings are animals as well. (definitely not suggesting that men are dogs by any  means ;0)) but simply replace the meat with hooker boots and breasts and you might be on to something. It also might be a good idea to realize that this phenomenon of breasts as aesthetically beautiful is about as ridiculous as our view of Chinese men who once lusted over women's feet once they were transformed by chinese foot binding, into stumps/sometimes known as lotus flowers.  The beautiful breast is not a universal ideal. These types of unsupported ideas such as Angier's can be extremely harmful to women and men since they contribute to biological determinist notions of sexuality, gender, etc 
 This book has an interesting take on how the mind interprets the slightest events between two people such as body language, facial expression and more. The facts laid out are informative. The prose though has much to be desired. Thu author uses "tacit" far too frequently, and clutters his points with obscure and infrequently used words. Commas and em-dashes are not in expected places, leaving you to read many sentences over again to get the meaning. I felt I had to stall way too often and not glide smoothly along. Good scientific work, but bad read 
 This is the kind of art that show me the power of fiction over reality. Why did he use those sizes? Wow! Did you see them? I do have fantasies but come on! Let's get real. Real guys with real dimensions. No more no less,  that's the beauty of life 
 Not sure what movie everyone else is talking about, but I fell victim to the hype as well. But PAN'S LABYRINTH is far from a masterpiece. If you want to see brutal violence - some of it directed against children - along with some horrific gore (including a Rambo-esque scene where one of the major characters sews up his slashed cheek with a needle and thread) then this is the movie for you. Forget what other people have written about adult fairy tales and whatnot; this is not an entertaining nor enjoyable fable. Nor film, for that matter. Subtract the special effects and there's not really much of a movie 
 I ordered the 7th edition as this page shows and incorrectly received the 5th edition. Problem was not corrected. 
 This was not very good, in my opinion. The Ring scared the bejeezus outta me. This was not scary. Two weeks afterwards, I still find my mind wandering about one thing...why the heck didn't they just kick that little boy in the head and send him accross the room? If I walk into my house and see a half-naked boy meowing and hissing at me, I'm gonna flip him over my knee and give him a good spankin 
 The razor isn't bad, but the cleaning system is a joke.  Mine wouldn't release the razor & kept recleaning it.  Plus, and I am surprised that this isn't mentioned in the other reviews that I read before getting the razor, the cleaning solution (which is an expensive, printer-ink type of gimmick) stinks like metal solvent.  Bottom line is this would be a decent razor if it was sold by itself without the cleaning junk for a lower price 
 ... both "Divorce & Money" books, that is, one by Smith and the other by Woodhouse. And I have to say, while this book DOES have a lower price, in this case you get what you pay for.   Thumbing through Smith's book, I found some helpful information but really, other than stressing that you had to go to a lawyer, a lot of it seemed less fleshed out than Woodhouse's book. Especially if your split is amicable (mine was), a professional needn't be that involved. Within minutes it was clear which book was better, and it wasn't this one 
 Well, not much else to say really... this pretty much sucks. Don't get me wrong, they are easily one of the best alternative bands EVER (along with Drive like Jehu, Fugazi and Sonic Youth). Their best albums are, in no particular order, HEAD/PURE, DOWN, LIAR and GOAT, with SHOT still being good but with a cleaner sound that sadly reminds that it wasn't produced by Steve "abrasive" Albini. This pretty much means that except for Blue, I'd recommend you buy anything else they recorded 
 in my 20s don't feel like setting up an account. anyway, i used this as they said, but i guess it spilled out of the tray and onto my lips... it burned so bad that my lip is now blistered and swollen. it looks like i got collogen. and it hurts like hell. i recommend sticking with the strips... and now i'm just hoping that my lips don't fall off cuz white teeth are nice and all, but i'm not trying to show them off THAT much... 
 Any book with a character (Shirley) who repeatedly says "jeez louise" needs some serious editing. This book in no way compares to Thayer's earlier books.  I agree with the reviewer who wrote that the writing was dumbed down to suit a wider audience 
 I took all the advice given in this book and put it into immediate practice.  One year later, I can barely put food on my table.  Be very careful if you try to start your own store.  Keep your day job.  Most people lose money in this venture!  Be warned 
 What this book fails to mention is that David Icke himself has claimed to be the son of god on national television (in the UK) among other things. He has also prophesied the destruction of New Zealand which was going to take place in 1991, along with massive tidal waves sweeping the Brittish coastline. That he has said these things are as well known in the UK as Clinton saying "I did not have sex with woman." David Icke is a first case nut trying to weave all the conspiracy theories of the world into one great mega consiracy (bottoming in ridiculous claims of extra terrestrials), never taking into account that human nature causes alliances to be broken as quickly as they are formed. I own this book, and can honestly say it was the worst money spent in my life, not to mention the time spent reading the presposterous claims in it. Take my advice: Don't waste yours 
 I tried it and I didn't like it.  I'd almost say read my review of the X-files 9th season and just replace any character names and whatnot, but I won't.  As another reviewer stated this show should've ended after seven years.  Through the show's seven year run they had a cohesive  story that kept me coming back every week.  The ga'uld were an origional idea for a villian.  Apothis and Anubis being of course the stand outs.  I still think they should've had a bigger story involving so'car rather then just an episode or two.  Starting with their decision to make the lost city an ancient outpost and put Jack as a general the show just lost everything.  As boring as season 8 was it was still better than this.  When will TV executives get it?  End a show while it's still strong.  Unfortunately they love to milk a show for everything they can get.  I'd like to say props to scifi for canceling it, but they should've done that two years ago.  Of course Jack isn't on this season which adds to the crap that is season nine.  Add in some bad new characters, one of whom tries hard to be Jack it's not even funny, and a rediculous new villian and you have the makings of bad tv.  If they wanted to do this crap they should've created another bad spin off.  I wouldn't of watched it, but a lot of people would.  Oh and that's another thing, what's with all the atlantis references?  I personally don't care what goes on in another galexy on another bad tv show.  The writting has completely gone downhill.  I never finnished the memory altering device episode because ten minutes into it I figured everything except for who killed the girl, and I just don't care.  And what's with having another villian who pose as gods?  If you're going to create a new bad guy at least make them completely different.  Course the main bad guys on atlantis are basically vampires who liik like marolyn manson.  I could go on, but instead I'll just say if you haven't seen this season then just don't bother.  It's not SG1.  You can't take away three main characters over a couple year span, then take away your main bad guy, replace them with lame characters and expect it to work.  It just doesn't 
 Year 1 was good.  Can't complain too much about it considering the price.  Then started year two.  I have to unplug the darn thing at least 10 times a day since the router just dies all of a sudden.  I don't know what to think.  I blame myself for buying the cheapest thing on the shelf but then for every person that raves about the Linksys there is another person that says its garbage.  I think a company out there needs to be build a solid router and not really worry about price because if it'll work and continue to work I think we'll all pay the higher price.  In short I wouldn't buy this router.  Pay more and buy the Linksys, I guess, but its a toss-up on what your experience will be with any wireless router *sigh* I just want a product that works 
 Sorry, have saved for my trip to the Far East starting next week 
 This is one of my favorite romantic comedies.  It is funny, touching, and has some of my favorite actors in it.  And it doesn't only center around the main characters but has a great ensemble cast of very interesting people! 
 First let me say that my father was a crewman on a destroyer that helped save many crewmembers of the franklin that were in the water so my brothers and sisters were all looking forward to this book as I was.   In a nutshell Steve Jackson does attempt to tell the reader of the story and rescue of the Franklin in WWII and his work is a noble effort. However either because of his limited knowledge of military hardware or because of an inept editor this book contains so many blatant and obvious technical and historic errors that I found it difficult to slog through. I started noticing these errors and then started counting and then finally I lost count all together. They are distracting to anyone who relishes true history. I haven't seen as many errors in a book since Stephen Ambrose's Wild Blue Yonder.  And the format of the book is disconnected because Jackson skips from the Franklin to the Santa fe, forgoing rhyme or reason in doing so. I understand why he does it but at times I had to stop in mid sentence to go back to see what ship I was reading about. (I wonder how many other readers had the same problem?) I could barely put heads or tails together. And my brothers and sisters all had the exact same problems with this book and that is why I am taking the effort to write this review.   We all know it is not the subject and the men have a fasinating story and we do not want or intend to take anything away from these heroes. It is just the way Lucky Lady is edited.   This book is a good story and I give Jackson an A for effort. But reading this book was work. A reader should never have to work to read a book. I was exhausted when I fianlly finihsed it. I just couldn't wait to put it down.     
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 Unfortunately, Mr Bickle's book is little more than unauthoritative ideas taught with authority.  Many of his statements of truth begin with, "I belive that" and "I am convinced that" followed by teachings that cannot be proven in the Bible.  He lifts up Paul Cain as a prophet equal to Old Testament prophets. Hmm.  Cain has claimed that Jesus rode in the car with him one day and in order to discourage his upcoming marriage, placed his hand on him and removed all sexual temptation from him for life.  Of course, Cain would later fall into sexual sin.  Old Testament prophets aren't what they used to be.  Bickle is the prophetic movement's damage control arm.  He is there to do the PR when things go wrong. For example, in this book he relates that one time a prophecy happened where a man told another man he was to have a music ministry.  Bickle says that guy blew the prophecy because what he really saw was musical notes surrounding the guy.  He interpreted the prophecy wrong. Oh, if only God would stop being so unclear!  I could go on, but I don't want to take the time. If you are a believer, pick read ALMOST ANY book on Bible interpretation and learn to discern truth from falsehood.  If only Bickle had done so as a young man, we wouldn't be subjected to such nonsense 
 Have you ever read a book wwhose plot was so convoluted and whose characters were so uninteresting that by the time you got to the end you just didn't care?  "Hour Game" was like that for me.  The promise displayed by the pairing of Sean King and Michelle Maxwell in "Split Second" isn't realized here.  If they became romantically involved, all the chemistry would be lost, but "Hour Game" suggests that, with that option closed to him, Baldacci doesn't know what to do with them.  If you're looking for a good Baldacci read--heck, a good thriller/suspense/mystery read, period--try his "The Camel Club" 
 If you're looking for an album of Bee Gees covers by an orchestra with an indistinguishable voice singing behind it then this album is the one for you. The mix is atrocious, virtually the only time you can hear Robin's voice clearly is when he's speaking at the beginning of the songs. This has to be the most disappointing album I've bought in a long time. I was looking forward to this album as I was interested in hearing Robin's versions of the Bee Gees songs originally sung by Barry, but I can make no judgement as I couldn't hear Robin on any of those tracks. The best example to try on the sampler is Night Fever; I could hardly hear Robin at all above the din from the orchestra (particularly the drums). In fact I had to listen to the track twice to actually confirm to myself that he was on it 
 Disney, just about the worst company on Earth, has many lines of magazines. This is just used to suck even more money, even though they already have so much money that they're kids drown to death in money. Then disney goes on to cancel Dave the Barbarian and Teacher's Pet, the only good Disney shows 
 The format of this book is interesting -- a collection of essays by people who might have nothing else in common besides being in this book.  In that, you read about a diverse group of topics by people who hold diverse opinions.  Unfortunately, they also have a diversity of credibility.  I found some lapses in essays on topics I know a bit about, so it made me wonder what lapses there were in essays on topics I knew little about.  The result was I found it hard to fully believe anything in the book.  For example, an essay by Arianna Huffington on how evil drug companies are and how they're in cahoots with FDA to get their drugs approved was laughable.  She cited no references to back up her assertions.  FDA analyzes the data submitted and only then sees if the conclusion they come up with on their own matches the conclusion of the company.  They cannot be pushed around by anyone.  And while it's true that some drugs that have been marketed have later been recalled for safety issues, it's awfully hard to identify rare adverse effects in the limited numbers of patients that go through clinical trials.  Much later in the book, the editor has a short essay on a compound that he claims cures cancer.  His evidence is based on test-tube assays and some anecdotal data in animals.  Oh, and it's a natural herbal product used in Chinese medicine for centuries.  His gripe?  That FDA (the same one so easily pushed around, according to Ms Huffington) won't let sellers of this herb put the anti-cancer claim on the label.  Well, FDA likes to see well-controlled, prospective trials that demonstrate a drug (or substance) is safe and effective.  They don't accept the "a billion Chinese people can't be wrong" argument, unfortunately.  They also need to inspect your manufacturing plant and to see your methods of producing the herb so that they can ensure the product is consistent.  If a company doesn't want to go through that cost and effort for an herb they can't patent, well, that's their decision, but FDA can't let them make a claim they haven't proven.  And a final example is the essay on veganism.  The author is clearly very passionate about living a life free of animal products or exploitation of animals in any other way.  However, his argument might have been more compelling if the literature he cited were from sources other than animal rights writings.  Furthermore, he makes a couple of errors:  he claims that humans cannot manufacture vitamin D (we do, in sunlight, of course), and he neglects to mention the problem of vitamin B12, stating that we can get all we need from plant material.  There is no vitamin B12 in plants at all, so vegans need to get it from somewhere.  Most supplements come from an animal source, so unless vegans eat lots of yeast extract, they're kind of stuck.  Nonetheless, the book does provide a lot of viewpoints and information you would certainly not read in the newspaper or hear on the nightly news.  So read it, but remain connected to your inner skeptic 
 What a joke!  there are only 2 decent songs on here cold and Dead Skin.  This band has a new single on the radio now and it actually sounds pretty good.  Hopefully their new album will be better too.  If you like the new song "Invinsible" That is from the upcoming album titled "Falling Away".  Hopefully the band went into a studio this time to record their new album.  So if you are thinking aout giving crossfade a listen I wiuld wait fir the new album.  My point is THIS CD SUCKS AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED 
 This book deserves no stars.   PLEASE stop buying and promoting this rotten book! This is a book about a rotten, selfish self-centered male who takes everything including the life of the female tree. Even at the end when he chops her down to sit on her as an old man, he's still unsatisifed and has a big scowl on his face!  The female tree gives and gives and gives, and the male (from boy to old man) just takes and takes and takes and is never satisified, happy or thankful.  What kind of story is that?  This is truly a rotten story. Don't buy it! Don't give this to your children! 
 I am not going to write what this phone does and what it doesn't, you will read it from other reviews. I will explain what problems I had and you might  have with it. At least it might help you to troubleshoot the similar issues. First, it was easy to setup the phone, connect it to the router and phone line, register your skype name and make your first land line call. Quality is good. Then I placed a skype call to a friend and ..first problem: no audio, nobody hears anything. I tried to use another skype account on my computer to make calls to/from sph200d and ..no audio.  I looked at all settings on the device, support website and found nothing. I tried to connect to the admin webpage using provided on the CD documentation username and password admin and admin and couldn't connect(second problem). Well, I reset a base unit and still couldn't connect to the admin page. I searched online and God bless internet found that documentation on CD is old and current username/password is admin/password. And what even better reseting a base unit have helped with audio problems! Hooray! Now I can make good quality skype calls without need to go downstairs to my computer.  The next and biggest problem I've experienced is no matter that automatic sign in option is turned on the phone(and the web page) is asking the password every time you sign off/sign in the skype. Turning phone off, reseting base/phone, using different skype id, etc did not help. I called support, waited 15 minutes and was told I need to register the product online first. Well it has sense, I did so and called again. 10 minutes later customer representative from Deli was ready to provide me with an excellent service. First, he said yes automatic sign in should work and my phone is not defective, and asked me to do all steps I did already, i.e. reseting, etc. No luck. Then he left to check about this issue and called me back to state that phone MUST ask for a password every time I sign in for a security reason! (what about remember username/password option there?). Nice lie to a customer to make him believe problem is solved.  Note: if you turn the phone off - yes there is an option to turn it off, please press and hold red button - without signing off, then when you turn the phone on it wouldn't ask you for a password. Right, but all this time that phone is off, friends see your status as online/away and may try to call you.  Well, there is a solution I've found for myself - never sign off, just change your status to offline. I have not decided yet whether to return/replace the unit or keep it. Maybe when you learn tricks on how to use a device it would serve you well. But at current price/quality I would not recommend it, too bad there is not many alternatives.Good luck with it 
 When you "search inside" the book while still on Amazon before purchasing the PDF of Hegel's _Phenomenology_, you are provided with pages from Miller's translation in the viewer. When one has opened the PDF which one can download upon purchase, however, it is not the Miller translation, but rather an UNATTRIBUTED translation. My goal in purchasing the PDF of the Phenomenology was to use it as a word-search for the actual physical book, a way of finding passages I had read but couldn't remember the location of. It can be used that way, partially, but only indirectly, because it is a different translation--it will only help you find passages in the Miller if Miller happened to have chosen the exact same word(s) as the secret translator of the PDF-version! That's the problem. The translation provided in the PDF will furthermore be difficult to cite, given that NO TRANSLATOR is credited with having brought the 404 pages into English (in addition, no year for the translation is provided either--at any rate, if these attributions are provided in the PDF, they are not easy to find, because I have not found them yet). I also went to digireads.com, which is listed in the PDF as its source, but their listing for the book says nothing about the source of the translation. [After a quick search on the web, it appears the translation is the same as the one provided for free on line on marxists dot org -- click on "reference" and then "hegel" to get a listing of all his works. That translation is listed on that webpage as being the Harper Torchbooks' edition of the Phenomenology, from 1807. 
 This album is a huge downfall for this band. Their best album is Fortress. I bought this one expecting to be thrilled and stunned. I wasn't. The lyrics are just not up to snuff. The music in each song seems the same. If you really want this album I recommend buy it used. It seems that good bands like those are going down the tubes. Sorry Sister Hazel 
 This item was fun for my daughter to build with her grandpa, but after it was built the fun was over. It doesn't do much except sit on the shelf and take up space. I told her to take it apart again and redo it. That might be fun once, but after that it will probably go to the Thrift Shop 
 india could have developed all the things you mentioned without the english.  you say we look at the poms with neither shame nor regret - well here's how we look at it -   http://www.atributetohinduism.com/European_Imperialism.htm#Rape%20of%20India%20by%20the%20Britis 
 Watching the Razor release (which I bought to save a few dollars) elevated my blood pressure due to the careless way this rare gem of a movie was treated. Let alone that the terrible translation made me miss the meaning all too many times.   Fortunately I was able to find the much-praised version released by ERA of Taiwan from a seller here on Amazon, and it sure did justice both to the film and to the dialog-sheer perfection. 
 not very helpful compared to the textbook I have. It has a lot of problems and worked out solutions sure, but not a whole lot on explaining the concepts behind them in words 
 The only reason I give this album a 2 instead of a 1 is because the production was very well put together. Lyrically this album is garbage. I give him an A for effort but as far as rapping skills go, he gets a F 
 I enjoy reading TV and movie critics to see how a good movie works or a bad show doesn't. In this collection of opinions, Mr. Tucker has no information on why a show does or doesn't succeed. Also, few things are black and white. He either hates or loves a program, period. If he hates it, the show has no merit. If he loves it, it can do no wrong. It appears this book was thrown together overnight after he looked at the TV Guide for titles of shows and just gave his hate/love of it. Worthless unless you think Mr. Tucker's opinion is the best. Also, it is painfully unfunny 
 IMPORTANT: Find a mobile with the option of it working, while being silent w/out music.  I thought this mobile was great for the first 5 minutes, but then I quickly realized, I couldn't get the thing to shut up- darn it- they didn't put that option on it! How can this be? It is a $40+  dollar mobile. My baby just wanted to see it go, but the music, and sliding beads put him over the edge. This mobile is too loud, and the sliding beads are loud as well. It stimulates baby too much. Even after covering it up and arranging it under the bumper pad- it was still too loud.   The motion is actually quite hypnotizing and great, but "Tiny Love" RUINED it by not putting a "silent running feature button" on it.  I'd pay $60 for it if it would just be quiet!!!   If this mobile worked without sound it would be wonderful. As it is now, I can't use it that much- only when baby is at his happiest. Even then, the mobile wears him out- and ruins his happy state, because it is too loud.  I think I shall pry it open and try to break the speaker.  I am serious.  I rated it with one star, because I can only use it when my baby is at his most rested and happiest state. If he is the least bit tired, it overstimulates him and makes him cry.  
 I haven't listened to these yet, and I'm sure the sound quality is great. However, trying to get the grilles to fit on the speakers after installing them in the ceiling has just been the most frustrating job of my entire kitchen rehab. 
 Well, let's put it this way ...  I bought this when the vinyl was first released.  Went with all the other APP albums I had.  My 700 or so vinyl discs have since been entrusted to an old friend.    I've since purchased *almost* all the APP CDs that I once had on vinyl.  Not this one.    For me, Pyramid was the pinnacle -- 5 stars.  Love the rest of the first four, as well as Stereotomy and Gaudi -- 4 stars.  I'd give 3 stars to Vulture Culture and Eye in the Sky.  But this one and Eve just didn't do it for me.  On a tangentially related note ... if you haven't heard Godley & Creme's Goodbye Blue Sky, try to find yourself a copy.  A rollicking good time 
 Sadly this second book left me unsatisfied. For one, Wouk's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second. Of course, once one has read through the first book, its hard to stop. Yet, by the end of War and Remembrance I was thoroughly sick and annoyed by Wouk's characters. It's hard to relate to super humans, who constantly do super human feats. Most of the characters in the book come from superior stock, graduate from the top universities, have extremely good looks, and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane.  I guess after spending endless hours reading the book I am somewhat frustrated. Perhaps you will be like me, and by the second book without pausing. But, for the sake of saving some time, I recommend you consider parting with the characters in book one. Don't make the mistake of buying book two just because book one was so good.          
 Robert P. Miles, aka simple investor, has written the worst book about Warren Buffett imaginable.  I read all this when it first appeared on the Berkshire Chatter Board & was appalled at the following he developed.  I bought his book becase I am always interested in disasters.  Mr. Miles may be the nicest man in the world but he is without doubt the worst writer.   The great thing about America is anybody can be anything:  Mr. Miles wanted to be a writer & he is:  yes indeed, Mr. Barnum was right!  I wish the rating system went to minus 5.  The worst thing is, now Mr. Miles has written a second book & I must buy it to see if he remains the world's worst writer.  Sincerely, Mik 
 I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers.  But this story is just way too slow.  Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again.  I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner.  About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel.  
 I've read good reviews of this camera on this and other sites but I am not having the same experience. The quality of the photos are horrible so I started thinking it was me and I tried it with different settings, tried being very, very still etc but, I only get one good shot out of about ten. I have a Fuji 4mp that I bought about 6 years ago and it takes way better pictures than this. I bought this so I could give my old one to my daughter but I'm gonna end up giving this one to my daughter and and keeping my Fuji. We recently had snow here in Tucson so I took pictures with mu Fuji and compares them to the Canon and the 6 year old Fuji Finepix beat it hands down. I don't get it, did I get a defective camera or am I doing something wrong or does this camera just suck 
 I just rented this movie this weekend because so many people had been telling me that it was great.  But I felt kind of let down after watching it.  It starts of well by giving the characters a brief introduction, but we really don't get to know any of them that well, except maybe Kurt Russell, so who really cares who dies?  There's no real build up to the huge wave hitting the ship; everything is fine, then the captain tells everyone to be quiet and listen, Richard Dreyfuss looks outside, and the wave hits; it's not all that intense. Then the rest of the movie is the main characters trying to find a way to get outside the ship.  But it gets kind of repetetive and boring, because they just go from one room to another.  It's like they get into one room, someone says "Here, this is the only way out."  Someone else says that maybe there's another way, but the other person says there isn't, then the water's coming, so they have to get out of that room quickly.  When they make their way into the next room, it's the same thing over and over again. When they finally get off of the ship, they get into a raft and the entire ship goes down right after they get off.  Then a guy shoots a flare, helicopters come, and the movie's over. So basically, this movie gets boring and repetetive and you just keep asking yourself when it will be over.  This is one movie I know I won't be buying 
 While an occasionally entertaining read , it is essentially useless for anyone looking for a "how to" book. There are a few helpful hints in the book, but overall is a waste of time. I found myself hurrying to finish it to get a book that might be useful. At least it was cheap 
 I AM PRETTY EASY TO PLEASE WHEN IT COMES TO MOVIES.LOW BUDGET,HIGH BUDGET,DOESN'T MATTER.THIS MOVIE IS ACTUALLY THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY 45 YEARS OF VIEWING.WAS TOTALLY NOT BELIEVABLE AND THE WRITING AND DIRECTING WAS SHABBY AT BEST.DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED BUCKS ON THIS LEMON!!!! 
 I'm not qualified to disagree with the glowing reviews of the acting, etc., but I was annoyed by the way the flashbacks were done.  I suppose it was a metaphor for what Iris must have been going through.  But LOTS of people are slutty or succumb to Alzheimer's.  What made Iris noteworthy was her writing.  To focus on the former and almost entirely omit the latter is shamelessly manipulative, and it made my girlfriend, who lost a grandparent to Alzheimer's, cry.  I suppose the moral of the story is:  Don't watch movies; read books instead 
 A retrospective of the photographer's work, not useful as a guide to how to. And of kinds of buildings we're not likely to photograph today. Didn't help me with clues to photographing interiors 
 This biography of General Winfield Scott is lacking from a number of perspectives.   First, there is a total lack of military analysis - the author merely states what Scott did but never in much depth and without an assessment of his strategy or tactical abilities.  We never learn how Scott evolved from a lawyer into a soldier - what was his military education, how did he evolve as a soldier over a 40 year career. How did he view new technologies like railroads and rifled artillery?  Second, Scott appears as a cardboard character here with little or no personal depth.  What were his views on subjects such as slavery, tariffs, the Indians? His family relations are virtually ignored - why did his wife spend so much time in Europe?  Instead, the author spends far too much time on Scott's political ambitions and his intra-service rivalries and bickering.  This is not what he is remembered for and should not be the primary focus for a military biography.  Scott was probably one of the best generals the United States has ever produced, particularly in light of the superb Mexico City campaign, and his generalship should be center stage in a biography, not low-level barracks intrigue.  Finally, the notion that Scott was the agent of manifest destiny is unsupported; he was a dutiful soldier, not an imperialist. Maps were inadequate to follow Scott's battles 
 Please forgive me, I do not prefer to be overly critical, but this book started out with so many innacuracies and sexist undertones that I just could not trust the author. Even those with the best intentions often lead people astray in their zeal and ambition for what they perceive to be "spiritual" or "selfless" longings. The author demonstrates in the introduction a profound disrespect, even for those who teach her, that goes beyond being a productive iconoclast. She also is, at least indirectly, sexist. If we replace the gender in even most of her other book titles, for example, rendering them: "A Man's I Ching" "The Man's Spirituality Book" "All Men are Healers: A Comprehensive Guide to Natural Healing" I think we could observe a pattern developing, as if a guide to natural healing could be comprehensive by focusing on only one gender. Still, if a man tried to get away with that, he would be considered a bigot, and rightly so, but I wonder why not a woman. Still, it doesn't end here. Her innacuracies in regard to history are further disuading. She calls Buddha "the great savior of India," which is quite a statement, something I am not familiar with, although I have been studying and/or practicing both Buddhism and Hinduism in both school and on my own for over ten years. She says that many Christian parables were directly taken from Buddhism, something she offers no evidence for. She also says that Shiva, one of the three fundamental gods of Hinduism, whose very symbol is the phallus, began as a woman- again presented as fact but without any supporting evidence. All in all, as I read, these things and others developed a mistrust of what else she may be attempting to teach.  As per the blogs on the back of her book, I do not believe that there is a difference between male/female sprituality. Spirit is not defined by such things, and it seems to me to represent a profound mistrust and misundrstanding of life's balance. Feminism is as empty as "Masculinism." Again, "feminist metaphysics" is another term that seems loaded with ignorance. Perhaps her Reiki portions are good, but analagously I would not take the chance to learn Algebra from a person who can't get their basic arithmitic down, especially when it seems like she alienates herself from the very people who taught her Reiki. Sadly, I heartily do NOT recomend this book or this author 
 Has this been any other author, I would have stopped reading after the first few chapters.  But as is sometimes the case with her earlier works, I kept reading on in hopes that the book would get better - it didn't.  After I got through enough of the book (having only about 100 page left to read), I just had to skip to the end to get the experience over with.  As another reviewer worded, this was quite one-dimensional and the characters were a bit disturbing, but not in the good sense, and the story just dragged on for far too long.  I grew annoyed having put so much time into reading this and it was quite the let down.  Tyler's later works are much better and if you want to get of those books, you'd be better off.    I don't recommend this book at all 
 I bought it given reviews by others, but my one must have been faulty coz it worked for about 1 second after installing it and it hasn't worked ever since.  I'd suggest any would be buyer pay a bit more for something that works 
 I read parts of this "book" until my intelligence was thoroughly insulted and I immediately returned it to the library. What a stultifying simpleton this man is. He is someone who wants to appear to have all the answers without having any foundation of intelligent ideas. And unsurprisngly, this dolt absolutely embarrassed himself during a recent appearance on the "David Letterman Show" and what made matters worse was just how oblivious he was to his infinite stupidity. First, he claimed that no one should criticize President Bush "because we're at war and it's no good for the country." Come again? I say that such a statement is "no good" for democracy, which is something this submental gasbag has forgotten about. The right to openly disagree with an alderman or a president is guaranteed by the First Amendment. And this man is a graduate of the John F. Kennedy School of Government? Also, he insisted that Cindy Sheehan, whose son was killed in Iraq, not have the right to be publicly upset with President Bush and the invasion of Iraq because "she's connected with left-wing elements in this country." What left-wing elements? I feel that Cindy Sheehan is as connected to left-wing elements as much as Bill O'Reilly is associated with logical reasoning. 
 Think carefully before buying this book.  You won't finish it.  The author spends most of his time describing (but not really analyzing) numerous works of art which are not illustrated in the book.  At first, I tried to look up each image online, but with the number of paintings he writes about, it quickly became impossible. It is pointless (not to mention boring) to read the descriptions without being able to see the works themeselves. A very small number of paintings are illustrated in the book, but even they are in black and white. The biographical portions of the text are interesting, but the book is perhaps 1/3 biography, 2/3 description, which makes it impossible to get through 
 There was no "0 star" to rate this book. Someone wrote your innane comments were "South Park" but that was giving you more credit than due.  This book knocks rooms decorated with "mod," "hippy," "psychedelic," primary, analogous, complementary, or accented neutral colors; functional autonomous rooms combining sports, hobbies, recreation, and academic dimensions within one room; it knocks the budget-conscious decorations of the handmade, handpainted, functional, antique, dime store, yard sale, thrift or expensive furniture stores; it slams grouped wall, shelf decorations used as room accents: keys, Americana cushions, books, candle holders, fruit in a bowl, potted plants; criticizes large eye-catching "centers of interest" used with living room furniture, sun face wall painting, "Abe Lincoln with butterfly bowtie," large eye over purple tub; the accented neutral black/white/yellow bedroom with Colonial style poster bed, Queen Anne chair, rocking chair, possibly Ethan Allen, round table may be possibly an old wooden construction cable spool covered with home sewn tablecloth; cubist, geometric, fractal wall decorations; use of light through uncovered windows, sheer curtains, roll-up wooden blinds, tie-back sheer curtains; and repainting an antique chair to accent a child's room.  I would not purchase nor recommend this book nor anything else written by this author.    
 I would like to start by saying that I was in the 101st airborne unit and assigned to the 2/502 strike force in Vietnam during the time which Manny Garcia is talking about in his so called book, I have talked with a lot of men that served with s during that time in the 3rd plt, and none of can recall a Manny Garcia. I can say that I am happy to say that he didn't include me in his book but he talked about an ambush where Boaz was killed and how he was sith him and how he watched his body being airlifted out on a chopper in a body bad and I can tell you from first hand that is no even close to the truth, I was a machine gunner during that time and Boaz was my A-gunner and a RPG rocket came in and got Boaz, my ammo bearer and myself and Boaz did not die in the field he hung on for three days and died on a hosiptal ship, and I was with him when we were air lifted out of the field, Garcia discraced a lot of good men that were my friends and I would like to have the chance to meet him and have im provide to me the proof he has for the book. I'm sure that won't happen but I can prove what I have said and would be more then happy to do so. What Garcia failed to talk about were the men that recieved the C M H and the one POW that we had. He talked about a parachute jump he made and he he did he did it alone because we did not make any combat jumps while I was there in 67-68. I hope the readers of this book would do the same to the book as he claims to have done with his metals and dumps themn in his yard. This ends my opinion of this book. Strike force all the way 
 How sad to see such a great actor such as Basil Rathbone in this crap after all his great films of the thirties,maybe it was personal financial troubles that forced him to accept his role in this movie that is so bad that it makes Plan 9 look acceptable 
 Let me explain the situation.  We have here young orphan kids who roller blade around trying to bring down a corporation with the help of a glowing ball.  Sound familiar?  Probably not.  I would say that nothing in the galaxy compares to the sheer stupidity of such a concept.  Recomendation?  I have none.  I have decided that slamming one's head into a brick wall would be more logical then this film 
 I have been reading James Patterson's books since the first Alex Cross came out. I thought the first 3 or 4 Cross books were brilliant but since then I feel the standard has dropped gradually to where we reach London Bridges.  This book has a solid storyline that needed fleshing out but I think the author was in too much of a rush to get the book on the shelves to worry about the story.  Let me get this right - Alex's family are taken hostage in the final few pages of the book, we get a couple of pages devoted to Cross' work and then the family is returned. There was no discussion on the anguish Alex was facing, nothing on the fear that the family was facing, nothing written about this at all! It would have been better to have taken them at the start of the book and have the book devoted to the fear that Alex was facing and his determination to catch the Wolf and get his family back.  If Alex was so dedicated to catching the Wolf, why was he taking so many time-outs throughout the book to visit little Alex, have dinner with his numerous friends etc?  Most disappointing, Mr Patterson 
 This is just a watered down version, by replacing the colorful language they have also taken away part of the beauty of the story.  I wish I had not wasted my money on this version 
 Don't order this book from amazon unless you want to be told you will have to wait over a month for Amazon to deliver it.  Order it from Barnes and Noble and get it quicker 
 ok they either have the wrong description or the wrong photo/title. the review is for Invasion of the Boy Snatchers. com'on people!!!XP only 1 star for the idiots at amazon.                                                               
 Nothing in the description indicates that this is heavily abridged. The introduction (after you've purchased the book) actually refers to this version not as translated (no translator is credited) but paraphrased. It is not even partitioned into St. Augustine's original 13 "books," but is instead resectioned with "new" chapter titles. I had to repurchase the book 
 The album has eight songs available on previous records (same version, same mix). It is a steal of your money. Only 2 songs are new and are not so good. It has 2 remixes (Cuando pasara and Bajo la piel) that are Ok.  Please don't waste your money   
 I don't mind that the original bleeped-out words are still bleeped on the DVDs... that's how the show was. (For example, I think the Viva La Bam DVDs would, for the most part, be funnier with the original tv bleeps.)  I don't mind that the original blacked-out and pixelated views are there... that's how the show was (and trust me, we're better for it).  With that being said, here's the real problem -- this is not presented in an as-aired episode format. Of course I should have realized that "volume" does not mean "season", but "season" is what everyone expects from a tv show DVD. That's how every other tv show is realeased; even the Wildboyz and Viva la Bam DVDs are presented in episode format.  This box set lacks because the bits are somehow funnier when viewed in context of the original episode. The recurring themes within the episodes are funnier. It's also much more convenient to sit down and watch an episode or two whenever you want. Instead, it all gets lost in the 2-hour marathon format of each "volume". Additionally, as many reviewers have mentioned, many of the classic bits are absent from this set.  Bottom line is, before you purchase this set, realize that many of the bits you remember may be missing. Also realize that each "volume" is a marathon of strung-together bits, and you will not see the actual episodes.  I suggest that die-hard Jackass fans actually not buy this set, because I think you will be more frustrated and upset in the end. Because of the "volume" format, you will probably only watch each disc once, then quickly retire it to the shelf. I regret that someone spent some good money buying this as a gift for me. I would gladly return it for only half it's original price if I could 
 No, I'm not being overly sensitive. This book is anti-semitic and proud of it.  It was originally published in 1920, written by a British correspondent who was involved in the initial investigation of the murders of the Romanovs and as such it has some interest.  The edition offered here is published by the "Institute for Historical Review" which appears, from the introduction, to be one of the unfortunately not uncommon organizations dedicated to falsifiying history by denying the holocaust, blaming  
 Ridiculous, convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring.   Did Cornwell even write this one herself? If so, she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread: On page 216 Marino remembers Mrs. Paulsson greeting him at the door "wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater", but later when he tells Scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door.  Perhaps it was the author's attempt to let readers think Marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened. However, to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct 
 From the description, we thought this was a book of advice and insights.  Instead, it is a little book of mundane aphorisms, one sentence nuggets of advice of uneven quality.  The book makes a lot of outdated assumptions about gender roles and the nature of fathers and sons and their relationship.  We're disappointed, since there aren't many books on the subject.  We're sorry we purchased it, even at the sale price of $1.50, and now we will just give it away.  Don't waste your money, or your time.  
 I purchased a Creative Zen Vision this weekend from a local retailer.  I plugged it in and the light came on indicating that it was charging.  I turned it on briefly while it was charging (a few hours in) and turned it back off.  I was never able to get it to turn back on again.  So I returned it and got another one.  The second one was even more broken.  When plugged in, the light didn't even come on.  I left it there for a few hours hoping it might have been charging anyway, but was never able to make it come on.  I returned it for a refund 
 I can imagine Susan Estrich sitting around and thinking, Damn that Ann, I'm gonna get that girl, that cheap no good dirty rotten right-winger.  Not too long ago while appearing on Hannity & Colmes, Ms Estrich had this to say: Ann Coulter looks good, but it's only a sham.  I just want to show the world that she's not the only one that can look good and sell books.  Not a word for word quote but pretty much on the mark.  Wow, how profound.  The trouble is, not only does Ms. Estrich not look as good as Ann, she looks downright ridiculous.  The first time I saw the cover, I laughed my a** off.  If you have to rip off your opponent by copying her look and cover, well that's a pretty strong sign that your case is weak.  What's inside isn't much better.  Susan loathes about the sorry state of dialogue in this country.  She should start to look at her fellow Democrats, the originators of vitriol.  So Susan can go ahead and try to sell books while Ann speaks truth.      The book is nothing but a knee-jerk response.  Pick it up at your local library if you need a good laugh.  
 I must admit, I was more disappointed in this book than any other I can remember reading.  While Cole is working hard at the arguably noble pursuit of writing about math and science for the layperson, she does so at the cost of any sort of actual relevance to the world of science.  By absolutely eliminating ALL mathematical rigor and substance from her writing, Cole leaves the reader with nothing but her own third-rate analogies, sappy philosophical bumblings, and less than shimmering prose.  I will admit that I was unable to make my way to the end of the book due to my utter frustration with Cole's destruction of the beautiful world of logic and numbers, and so it is concievable that the book becomes better near the end.  Unfortunately, anyone interested in learning or thinking about mathematics will likely be quickly repeled long before.  List this book with Gary Zukav's "Dancing Wu Li Masters" as abominations of the world of pop-science 
 Gray is so far off the target when it comes to nutrition and exercise.He says women might gain weight from exercise? Didn't he ever hear about if you burn more calories than you take in you'll lose weight? Simple math Gray!Everything about this book smacks of sell,sell,sell! snail oil salesmanship.When will he  realize people have different needs bssed on individuality rather than gender.No one has any business making the blanket statements he makes,it's irresponsible. Another very corny statement is women get good brain chemistry from affection and cuddling,while men get good brain chemistry from sex.How much longer is society going to promote these  myths? Bad advice,irresposible and plain corny 
 I wasn't sure if this was from a S. King writing or some child night mare of a writing!   It's obvious that any one can write then have that book published.   Only the most outrageous of imagination could come with this fairy tale type of fantasia.  Sorry, but the author is searching for the truth in the wrong place! you Know?     
 I love Mariah's voice and a lot of her older stuff. I have to agree with a previous review about the guest rappers though. There are several songs that just drone on and on and have no energy. I was looking for some good remixes of her songs and I was pretty much let down. Overall, I'd say this wasnt a good purchase 
 I ordered this dvd series because I liked Kristy Alleys performance in other movies and series. But this is totally different. A lot of bad language is used and a very adultrous lifestyle is promoted. After viewing two episodes I put it in the trash. Watching this does not make me happy 
 If you've never read any well written and insightful books on technology adoption (such as Lewis Mumford's "Technics and Civilization") then perhaps parts of "The Change Function" may appear profound.  However if you had, then this text will find you wishing you had spent your time and money elsewhere.    People won't use technology that's hard to use? Profound.  People only learn a new way to drive to work when the old route is under construction? Brilliant.  Coburn goes way out on a limb to predict what technology will succeed...are you ready? Flat screen technology and Blackberries (mobile enterprise email). The man is a psychic.   On top of the lack of anything remotely fresh in this book, reading The Change Function is a bit like reading a version of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations; except the people being quoted are not familiar to you...unless you are one of Pip's blog friends, who receive endless attributions throughout the book.    Please save your time and money. Re-read Telecosm (Gilder) with an eye for how so many actual predictions (not like Coburn's Monday-morning QB stlye) were wrong.    BTW - I predict hybrid cars will be big in the future 
 I would agree with most of the negative reviews this book has received so far, and history has indeed been re-written. While Mick Taylor's role in the Stones' career could not be overstated, it is Bill Wyman's virtual absence that is the most shocking.  Most of the band's shots from the 70's, but especially the 80's and 90's seem to deliberately leave him out.  This is insulting to any self-respecting Stones fan and quite a disappointment (although not a complete surprise).  As everyone knows, Bill was an original member of the band and his career as a Stone lasted almost 40 years.  The Mick'n'Keef show could never have existed without the steadfast rythm section that anchored the band throughout most of its history.  Shame on the other Stones for going out their way to practically eliminate Bill Wyman from this biography.  And who exactly does Mick Jagger think he is fooling when he sings about neo-cons, then proceeds to pick Ameriquest, one of the worst predatory lenders in America, as a tour sponsor?  Who said the Stones aged gracefully?  Get Bill's book instead.   
 I think Steve Seim's review is excellent. The book is a famous statement of an editorial point of view, namely the communitarian claim that individualism has led to the incoherence of Americans' religious and moral claims. But like so many books, the authors dissemble to pretend they're scientifically reporting objective news rather than a kind of editorial. In this sense, the book is not substantially different from the kind of pseudo-science we've come to expect from sociologists, who, after conducting some interviews and handing out some loaded surveys, tell us "what's really going on" with the "modern American woman" or "Generation X" or, in this case, the "modern [misguided] liberal American." I, for one, view such work as social criticism vital to our society, and it makes thoughtful reading, but it is not scientific, and I wish we could get beyond this need to justify such claims with "scientific" surveys.  Considering this book represents more a kind of punditry than research, despite its claims, please consider reading the most famous response to the book, the chapters from Jeffrey Stout's "Ethics After Babel" devoted to the book. Stout, in one instance, close-reads one of the interviews, in which a guy is asked what's important to him, and whenever he talks about "being good" and "being honest," the interviewers grill him "but why? but why?" until after many replies relating to maturing and learning from his experience, he finally says something like "it benefits me to live a life of honesty" so the authors end the interview and conclude he's a rabid individualist whose only basis for his ethics is egocentric utilitarianism. They did not, for example, explore whether he has a rather rich concept of personal honor, or even a sense of Stoic maturity, either of which seems a more accurate way of describing his answers up to the point they choose to end on. Either alternative reflects a vocabulary of long standing moral traditions, which would contradict the authors' claims - ala Alisdair MacIntyre-- that modern liberal Americans have no such vocabulary.  In fact, I find it rather hilarious that they use this subject as the quintessential amoral individualist, since communitarian founding father Aristotle says repeatedly throughout the Ethics that living a life of virtue must benefit the individual, for to say the opposite would be akin to saying that giving a plant sunshine doesn't benefit the plant.  Of course this connection of virtue and human benefit is problematized in other ethical systems, but, still, it's funny to me that Arisotle could be characterized as lacking a moral framework because he connects living virtuously with personal benefit.  In any case, reading both this book and Stout, you're in a good position to come to your own conclusions 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 In a few words, this film sucks!  Please don't waste your hard earned money on it.  The quality, story-line, and acting are so bad, they aren't even funny.  I can't even believe that they made a sequel.  If you want to see a good Latin horror movie, try 'The Devil's Backbone' or 'Thesis'.   
 30+ years after Jimi's death this author jumps to the head of the (very long) line of Hendrix biographers who claim to have the "true" story behind/about the man and the musician . . . and like so many previous biographies this one falls woefully short. What you will find in this book - an interesting narrative on Hendrix's childhood, a perspective on Hendrix's heroin possession trial in Canada, a brief chronology of The Experience's 1966-67 rise to stardom, a "theory" on his death and A LOT of the stereotypical tortured artist trapped in a web of managers, lawyers, promoters and hangers-on. What you won't find in this book - any serious discussion, analysis, description or even a glimpse of Hendrix's music - a fairly extraordinary feat for a Hendrix biography. Quotation marks are used very liberally throughout this book and I'll leave it to someone else to discuss/verify the authenticity of the remarks and sources - I'll simply say the "conversations" proved incredibly uninteresting to this reader - again somewhat remarkable when you consider the subject matter. The last section of the book concerns all the financial/legal issues concerning Hendrix's music since his death. As a long time fan I've "experienced" the re-issues, bootlegs, dub-overs etc.,(and long ago realized that these releases had more to do with money than with the music), and I guess I've been peripherally aware of the legal battles, but at this point in time as long as the Hendrix audio library stays available with an occasional addition here and there I'm happy, so the in-fighting chronicled here, (as pathetic and petty as it was/is), was of somewhat less interest to me... and also paints the author in a similar light. Unfortunately, as it was 40 years ago, Jimi has many admirers/fans but very few if any friends.  
 I just had to read and write a review about this book based on my niece's meeting with Sean. But first, the review.  In order not to diminish the previous reviews, I will just focus on the whole war talk. On page 4--no messing around here--Sean states, "[w]e must take the war to them, rooting them out of their swamps and destroying the despotic regimes that furnish their lifeblood." Wow, bring it on dude. Oh, you mean let's send somebody else's kid to fight, right? On page 247 he drills that point in with, "[i]'d like to see the good governor [Dean] present a case that there's any higher moral cause than defending one's innocent countrymen against terrorist attack." If it's such a great "moral cause," Sean, why oh why ain't you out there with the rest of my family? Does this, by the way, mean you are immoral since you punked out? I never thought of myself as "moral" just because I volunteered and served as a paratrooper in Vietnam. Is military service only for Democrats and brown people? Should we have a new draft catagory such as "1R" for "Republican," which means you don't have to serve?  To paraphrase Frank Purdue, it takes a tender man to spout tough talk. Page 108 puts down Democrats (I'm a Democrat who served in Vietnam, or am I repeating myself?) with, "[w]hen it comes to the Hitlers, the Brezhnevs, the Saddams, pussyfooting is the order of the day." Yeah, Sean, tell me what you really think. Well, Sean, some of us are out there strapping it on every day while you...do....what? And wasn't the Bush family in business with Hitler during WWII?  Here is really why this guy is full of himself. My niece, visiting me before heading to the Gulf and her first combat tour, spotted him in DC. She introduced herself and told him she was a fan. When she told him she was in the military he offered her a free book, saying he would ship it to her. She is very polite, and told him he didn't have to. Sean insisted. She wrote her address down. Before heading overseas, I asked her if Sean had sent the book as promised. No (and no surprise for me). So, me being me, I contacted Sean by email twice but got not reply. Too busy impressing all those other servicewomen, I guess.  Sean Hannity, not just by this book but by his actions, is a coward, blowhard, and more interested in putting the make on cute servicewomen. His book dedication to his wife means about as much as the rest of the book. You should be ashamed of yourself, Sean, but that would mean taking a "moral" position, wouldn't it?  
 Don't buy this. "From the Grave" is overdubbed b/w film without Bruce Lee in it. The other two aren't great either 
 Got the product. In 2 minutes it wasn't working. Mattel is sending me a new one. The basically tell you to cut the mic so it can't be used and toss it and they send you a new one. I thought it was a sad waste of resources that they don't look to recycle the product 
 Chris Crutcher's book, The Sledding Hill, focuses on points such as life after death, censorship, and religion. The main character Eddie goes through some hard knocks when his best friend Billy and his father die within three months of each other.   The book was a quick read, and although it was enthralling it was poorly written and took subjects like the afterlife far too lightly. Since the beginning of time humans have wondered what happens after death, and this is a great subject to stimulate childrens minds, but Chris Crutcher does not seem to have thought much about it, instead just making a world that seemed interesting to him.  Eddie is far to easily able to accept his ability to telepathically talk to his dead friend Billy. This is a mind numbing subject to think about, and Chris Crutcher treats it like childs play.  Chris Crutcher does bring up very controversial points in today's society. The book also revolves around the censorship debate, and religion. Eddie is struggling with being able to accept religion or God and I related to this, as any teenager would. Chris Crutcher captured the struggle that teenagers have in society, and created a great climax when Eddie spoke at his church.     I feel a book trying to cover major points like these needs to be more in-depth and take these subjects more seriously. Chris Crutcher seems to be a very wise writer, but I feel like his book was not well thought out 
 Professor Yoo's writing style is as nearly befuddled and confused as his understanding of a Constitutional law.  I can say without fear of contradiction that this is by far one of the most ill-conceived, unsubstantive  and pointless books I have ever had the misfortune to read.  His theories and assertions are never clearly backed up with any real documentation or legal reasoning and he fails miserably in making any clear or concise point.  I feel this book was nothing more that a total waste of time. Perhaps Professor Yoo should stick to writing legal arguments, where style and in his case substance, don't really matter. 
 I have to agree with Stephen Haines. This guy drags in everything but the kitchen sink. He makes Boehme a Gnostic, the troubadors, the Knights Templar, William Blake, the Masons, Jung, and finally, any physicist worth his salt.  I mean, some of these folks might not have been orthodox in their Christian practice, but being heterodox does not make one a Gnostic.  How did he forget Meister Eckhart, and Sabbatai Tzvi? If he has Boehme as a Gnostic, then these also are Gnostic.   He never distinguishes between Gnosticism as a group of sects, and gnostic practice, which pervades Kabbalah, Sufism,etc.   This is just not a good book 
 When I buy from the "Back To Mine" series, I expect "smooth" and "groovy".  This one offers not much of either.  The individual songs don't always fit the late night mood, they don't work together as a group, and the transitions between them are jarring and awkward.  I can't recommend this CD.  Don't be duped just because you like Morcheeba, as I was 
 "Mr. Mani" is the story of a Sephardic family over a couple centuries, told via one side of conversations, and going backwards in time.  Both devices are hoary. I didn't believe for a second that the characters were of their own time. They were not even three-dimensional moderns. The prose alternates between plodding and precious. It's beyond me why this novel is well-respected 
 We went to see this at the time when we went to see any horror flick, much less anyting with Jamie Lee Curtis. It came out just about the time when every holiday was getting a horror movie named after it. Whether the movies promised to be good or bad, we went and had fun with them either way. This one we had fun in how bad it was. This was one of those, "picked on, pencil necked geek gets pushed over the edge by a cruel prank, only to come back with genius killer skills, somehow attained super strength and the speed of the Road Runner to get from one end of a train to the other to pull of impossilbie kills aided only by clever camera play." In short, there's nothing to be believed in this stinker. LIke a "Friday the 13th" flick, you merely wait for the kills, and try to outguess the next guy as to how it ends, and pray for that to come as soon as possible. The movie pulls out the stops, giving us Curtis for eye candy and David Copperfield to amaze us, perhaps even toy with us as to him as a possible suspect. But in general, this movie insults the viewers intelligence and lures you with a hope for a "Halloween" type thriller. There's too much stupidity from the victims, oh, until one genius finally puts 2 and 2 together. There's too much "not acting on a possible emergency situation in unison." And given her presence, there's just not enough Jamie Lee to make this crock worth sitting through. We had a gas picking this movie apart in the theatre. It made us callous for the impending onslaught of slasher flicks to follow in the 80s that got worse, more predictable, and far too numerous to maintain our interest. This movie got that ball rolling. Don't waste your time. You'll get more excitement out of watching Jamie Lee's finger nails dry for a couple hours 
 I am a 6'1" female and ordered a size 12.  The actual shoe part fit fine,  however, I could have fit both legs into one boot.  The sizing was utterly ridiculous.  You will also be charged 20% restocking fees for any returned merchandise.  Don't waste your time.  
 I recently witnessed this car crash of a movie. I usually like parodys but this movie was boring and unfunny. 
 Was disappointed with the color of the shoe, because there is a difference between the left and right shoe.  At first i thought the wrong models were packed in the box. But no, it's the shade of the leather that is different, left shoe is darker than the right shoe.  Being in Singapore, it will be expensive for me to ship back for replacement. (I had the shoe delivered to my Brother-in-law in L.A., who brought it back to Singapore for me 
 His previous album "You've come along way baby" was so good and original but now it seems like he's spending more time on his music videos then on the music, many songs on this Cd are also based on samples from older songs like "Star 69" and "Weapon Of Choice" and "Sunset" some say he's matured as a artist but when something worked pretty good why don't continue in that way instead of making the oddest songs he could think of. Norman Cook is a dance artist and there's no way he should try to do something he isn't used to. Bootsy Collins "Weapons of choise" and Macy Gray "Love life" is Cd, so does the Voice of Jim Morrison on "Sunset" but they cannot save this album from fiasco, to me it feels like the guest attists take too much place, it's no longer so much of the original fat boy slim sound here. "Yo Mama" got a cool sound though, but he could have tried to do something more with that song. "Song for shelter" is dark and slow aswell, think he even released it on single. Let's just wait for a better time, this album was really a flop 
 This certainly qualifies as the worst form of child abuse: subjecting a small child to a life long in suffering and oh-so short (try once every eighty six years) in success. It's bad enough that adults subject themselves to the annual excursion in anxiety, excuses and whining otherwise known as the Boston Red Sox. Now they want to train their young'uns how to be the next generation of losers, complainers and mindless zombies who anually pay the most, and get the least in return, from their own, personal perdition. Chapters certainly included are:    1)It's 75 Years in the Future and the Evil Empire Still Exists??!!!    2)2090: The Year of the Next Sox Championship.    3)22nd Century Has Arrived! Can We Tear Down This Sewar of a Stadium??? Parents, if you truly love your children, you will stay away from this exercise in poor taste and futility - not to mention the humiliation and/or downright bullying your child is destined to endure as a live-long Bosox athletic supporter! I implore you!! No child is too young to train, even retrain, for a life of glorious success and anchievement and positive expectations as a fan of the New York Yankees. After all, twenty six (that's 11111111111111111111111111 for all you Sox fans for whom it's just too late - sniffle,sniffle I feel your pain) yes, that's 26 World Series Champioships and that can't...just CAN'T be wrong!!      ALSO included in this package is a rousing new, digital recording by Willie Nelson of his classic, "Mama, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to be Sox Fans," recorded at a small club in New York City. I'm told Theo Epstein himself (in attendance shortly after he had quit as Sox GM last winter!) jammed with Willie and the innumerable Yankees fans who joined them both on the chorus. Thrilling, just thrilling!!  
 The thesis of this book is that the economic disparities between the US, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Haiti result from the superiority of WASP  culture.  The study of the relationship between culture and progress has a  long history dating back to Max Weber.  This book offers nothing new except  a harsher edge that gives it a stench of white-supremacy.  Harrison is  clearly aware of the potential for charges of racism.  He makes extensive  use of quotes from blacks and Hispanics to make points that would be  offensive coming from a white person.  This is reminiscent of the 2000  reform party's black vice presidential candidate whose job it is to state  that Pat Buchanan is not a racist, not an anti-Semite, and not a homophobe.    Harrison's book purports to be a book on development, rather than a  justification for the disparities of wealth between the first and third  worlds.  Indeed, there are reasonable policy proposals in this book, as  well as a decent refutation of dependency theory.  However, there is  nothing really new here.  Economists almost universally rejected dependency  theory long before "Underdevelopment is a State of Mind" was  first published.  Anyone even vaguely familiar with the development  literature will come away with nothing more than the simplistic argument  that poor people deserve to be poor because of their inferior culture.    The book gives no hint as to the fundamental causes of cultural  differences.    Clearly culture affects economic progress.  However, it is  equally clear that economics affects culture.  The U.S. has a culture  conducive to capitalist growth in no small part because it is a wealthy  capitalist nation.  Any writer sincerely concerned with improving the  welfare of poor people should look favorable upon immigration and cultural  exchanges.  With the fed raising interest rates to choke off US growth and  prevent labor shortages, the U.S. can absorb vastly increased levels of  immigration.  The success of immigrants from very poor countries makes it  clear that it is the institutional and cultural restrictions of poor  countries that make them poor.  They do not bring their supposed  "cultural inferiority" with them.  The fact that Harrison's book  contains diatribes against immigration shows that his concern is with  relieving his own guilt about living better than 90% of humanity rather  than improving the lives of the bottom 90% 
 Jenkins appears obsessed with a kind of American high school machismo.  He delights in being tougher and more stoic than the average "tourist" even when it is clearly not true.  He bails out his trip, for boredom, he carries a gun, that he doesn't need, and mocks anyone  who disagrees with him in the most condescending tones.  He is, in short,  bad company on any trip.  Mercifully, he had the good sense to give up on  this one.  I wish I had 
 I've always been a casual fan of the Talking Heads. I liked their music, but only had a few of their CD's, so I decided to treat myself to this set which I thought would be comprehensive. Well, upon receiving this mess of a "box  set" I was so taken aback that it took me a while to get to the music.  The "box" is actually a rectangular book with fairly bizarre and unappealing art. (Nudes that represent... what?) The book itself, because of its shape, does not lend itself to easy reading, and while the contents are of a decent quality, some artist appreciations by the likes of Rick Moody and commentary by the band members,some intersting curios, like notes and original lyric sheets, and a discography, trying to read this while hoping the binding holds up while the pages flop all over the place is quite a feat.  The music itself is a decent overview of the band's work. The three CD's have a nice cross section of the band's work, but for the cost and the annoying packaging, I would have been much better off with SAND IN THE VASELINE 
 First, let's begin with the premise that the collaberation of, at one time, in one relative place, and with (seemingly) one goal, those who have come to be collectively known as the Founding Fathers was, by any accounts, an extraordinary period in the history of humanity.  A Dream Team, if you will.  Second, let's remind ourselves that none of these men were devoid of their flaws.  Many, in retrospect, carried their warts and blemishes with a sense of pride, if not prominence.  While it is inevitable, and not inappropriate to find an interest in these founders and their various achievements so timely and exciting centuries after they did what they did, it is also inevitable that the lines of truth and accuracy have faded in the interim, and an honest interpretation of events between 1750 and 1820 requires of the interpretor an open mind, and a lack of preconceived notions.  Ms. Appleby has not satisfied that requirement in her Jefferson interpretation.  Appleby admits in the opening paragraphs to be an admirer, and continues to clarify that point throughout the book.  She sets Jefferson apart from the other 'founders,' who are minimized, if not dismissed as having provided less,if any substance to the drive for that ultimate goal.  Indeed, Appleby seems to be saying that the goals of the various gentlemen involved were so varied as to be in direct opposition to each other.  Moreover, Appleby outrightly idolizes Jefferson.  Her platitudes do not, however, shine any more light on the man, who certainly qualifies as one of the more secretive/introspective of the bunch.  Instead, one is left the option of accepting Jefferson as a Moses-like character, or of choosing to look elsewhere for a more in depth assessment of this certainly great man.  Other reviewers have noted her attention to Jefferson's issues with slavery, with women, with indians.  These are discussed, but rather than in a way that would try to find a root cause, or to compare them with other frailties in his character, the effort seems to be to offer them as some offset to the bulk of the material, which is close to hero worship.  There is enough information about Jefferson, even considering the depths of his persona, to identify some (but certainly not all) of the demons that tormented the man.  And also enough information to know that Jefferson was not immune to crossing the lines of decorum that separate the common man from the political climber.  But you wont find that discussion here.  In the end, we have yet another portrait of this man, who deserves his place in the pantheon, but ther is no flesh, no blood, no heart.  Just canvas 
 This book did not teach me anything and was a waste of money. page 364:  Principles of Long term investing:  "Chapter 8 shows that among the S&P 500 Index returns, large value stocks have a small edge over large growth stocks."  Now look at Chapter 8.  "Of the 10 largest corporations, only 2  (Exxon Mobile and Citigroup) are value stocks."  duuhhh.  Now I know what to do.  I have a choice of two stocks.  If you already know all there is to know about the stockmarket, buy this book and pat yourself on the back for being so smart. If you know little, it won't add to your knowledge at all 
 Everything is fine. Go back to sleep. Nothing happened here, move along. The government is honest. The Warren Report was totally comprehensive and answered all the questions. Believe. Obey. Go back to sleep. Everything is fine.  I did actually read this book. I will give one thing to the author, he certainly did a fine job finding many of the conflicts and contradictions in the "offical" story. Too bad he He didn't explain any of them. It is a fine research tool in that way.   Unfortunately for Posner his attempts to "debunk" are wholly inadequate and unconvincing. In fact this book is so filled with nonsense and speculation it does more to BOLSTER the case against the "Oswald did it alone" story. If it is true that this was a case of the "lone nut" why would the explantions have to be so over-reaching and internally inconsistent? If it was a straighforward case, the the evidence should be equally straightforward and not so convoluted.  The authors "explanations" are unsupported by fact and at times you can see Posner reaching to the point of "I don't even need to prove it, it should be obvious"  If this is the best effort to prove the Oswald "lone nut" story I no longer have any doubt about the conspiracy theory. If the lone nut story was true there would be supporting evidence that was consistent with the real facts, all the facts and not just the ones cherry picked by the author.  Nice try Mr. Posner 
 The author has some good information that could have been communicated in 75 pages, but he chose to bury the valuable nuggets in an ocean of words and self congratuatory hype.  Don't bother with this book 
 I was very disappointed with the durability and time that it took to get this tent set up. It took me about 2 1/2 hours to assemble the tent and then once it was up it could never stay up. The joining brackets couldn't hold the poles together and everytime the tent was moved or touched it fell apart. I went inside the tent to put it back together and one of the poles fell straight down hitting me under the eye and cut it. This is why I am returning it. If it's not safe for me to be in then I certainly don't want my daughter playing in it 
 I was very disappointed in this selection.  Maybe a MALE football fanatic would find something appealing, but I was VERY bored!  Take me back to court, to the lawyer's office, to the judge's chambers,...just about anywhere but these bleachers!! 
 I'm sorry, but honestly, I bought both of her books, read a few chapters, and I just don't like her approach to food.  Food is an addiction, yes, but I think it is unreasonable to live the rest of your life without some flour, some sugar, some good fat, and boiled meat!!!?? jesus, the day I have to eat boiled meat, just put a fork in me, I'm done and on my way to straight up deprivation binge cycles or anorexia. eating is a privelage and one of life's great pleasures, people who are healthy are priveleged to have this pleasure but life needs balance. I think of the my many relatives that have had cancer and could not eat.Even though I think Sheppard has some great connections about food and addiction, I think her approach is too extreme and not mind/body focused enough, and frankly I just didn't like her. Kudos to those she has helped, get it where you can! But, I don't think this is a five star book - going back to Geneen Rot 
 ...clearly an argument that displays first a loyalty to a specific outcome, and then seeks a way to get there.    Rauch does well not to demonize the opposition, who, certainly, can be their own worst enemies when it comes to debating the issue, trotting out canned phrases like "family values," and "the sanctity of marriage."    Nevertheless, his assertion that allowing gays to marry will strengthen the instution misses the point entirely.  First of all, he rightly recognizes that marriage is not just a religious institution, it is a social one.  By legalizing gay marriage--and even civil unions--you are forcing people not only to accept, but to endorse behavior that they find abnormal and morally abhorrent.  Like it or not, marriage is, by definition, the union of a man and a woman; it has never been anything else, until very recently in those mercifully few countries that have legalized it.  Dismissing this fact as a reactionary loyalty to tradition doesn't change it.    Gay marriage probably won't weak the instution of marriage as a whole--it is on shaky legs as it is--but it certainly won't help it.  The state regulates marriage as it is--we are NOT free to marry whomever we want, and just because we might want to badly, that doesn't make it our right.  It is government's job to protect the interests of its citizens, and clearly citizens feel they have a very strong interest in NOT redefining marriage.  And in fact, gays do have the same rights as the rest of us, contrary to what Mr. Rauch suggests.  Gays are free to marry a member of the opposite sex, within the boundaries set by law.  That they don't want to is hardly society's fault, and hardly a reason to change a fundamental social institution, just to satisfy their desires.  His arguments that gay marriage is not a slippery slope remain unconvincing.  If objective values like tradition are so easily discarded to accomodate a small minority of malcontents, then what logical reasons can there be not to accomodate other malcontents? Does this mean that we can realistically expect people to petition to marry their dogs?  Of course not.  But is there really a compelling argument, then, for continuing to outlaw polygamy?  No.  I agree with Rauch regarding leaving the argument to legislators rather than the judiciary.  Most Americans despise the idea of having a judiciary shove its values down our throats, and this more than anything is probably what has given traction to the anti's position.  As a matter of strategy, it's bad for gays; as a matter of policy, it's bad for America.   
 This book really has annoyed me. I knew nothing about using color in oil paintings, and I still know nothing after reading it: 1) The book is basically a series of pictures of this artist's paintings (one or two per page), with really little comments near them. The pages are really empty: small pictures with little text. 2) Sometimes the author speaks about techniques (i.e. direct or indirect painting) and after reading the text I still don't understand what is she talking about.  3) There are also a lot of trivial explanations (like that of primary, secondary colors, etc.) that it seems a joke dedicating a lot of space to them. 4) The paintings are almost all beautiful, but it is not worthwhile buying the book just to see the illustrations. 5) The most of the explanations sound to me like: "I thought I could use red here, and I did it. I like the result because it reflects the emotions I had when I was painting. You must do what you find right". Do I have to extract a knowledge from that?  After reading the book I thought the author made an effort to avoid good explanations. Perhaps this book is not intended for beginners like me, but I think it is a bad book for everyone. She seems a good painter, but this book tells me she is not a good teacher.  Sorry for the comparison (because they seem to follow different goals), but "Painting the Impressionist Landscape" from Lois Griffel is infinitely better than this one from Mcmurry. I never regreted buying Griffel's.  You are warned: don't let a good cover mislead you 
 Oh my goodness me where do I start? This book is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The writing level is comperable to that of a 7th grader. The story is very poorly told as well. The writer tries to make herself sound talented by using similies and metaphors at the most awful points in the story. The story could've been interesting if I was written nicely, and was more in depth of events. This book gets too much publicity than it's worth, and this is probobly only because of the subject matter. The book starts off with Lalu, poor Chinese immigrant who was sold multiple times in China, and was starving. Once she came to America she was fed plenty of food, but unfortunetly, she was a sex slave for an evil Chinese Saloon owner. This is where the story gets uninteresting and stupid. She's then sold off the Charlie, a good friend of the man who brought her to the town she resides in. Then it just tells us what happens to her life after all of this. Maybe I didn't like this book because of the subject (Immigrant books never really were my favorite), but the poor writing style sealed the deal for me. Your money is better spent on something else 
 This movie is almost like Evil Dead meets Ever After and Van Helsing, while Sleep Hollow provides the backdrop.  This movie is like a mainstream B movie.  There were times I found myself laughing out loud at how cheesy or genuinely funny the movie was.   I would say Matt Damon and Heath Ledger didn't do a bad job acting, however both of their performances aren't anything to get excited about either.  It is worth watching this movie just to see some of the set design and SOME of the special effects. But there are other movies in this department that deliver in a much better fashion.  I don't think this movie did very well in the box office and I think I have a theory.  This movie was promoted with a PG-13 rating, which means anyone who is over 13 or with someone as old as 13 can see this movie.  Well some of the graphic violence in this movie was crazy.  I can see a parent not wanting their under 13 year old to see this violence, and an adult might wanting more graphic violence.   I don't know, I felt this movie was pretty brutal for a "light-hearted fantasy adventure".  Come on man, let's be honest with the viewers of America, this movie was morbid.  I can list some moments:   1) A man is shot in the back of the neck and there is plenty of blood 2) A child looses his eyeballs via mud 3) Spider webs come out of a horses' mouth and eat a child  4) A woman's face cracks and the decay of death is reveled under her skin 5) A man is lanced with a broken flag pole 6) Several decapitated heads 7) A kitten is killed by a huge fan 8) Horses are lit on fire  Now the violence didn't bother me, a movie is a movie.  I just find it so interesting that there is such tightness around movie ratings.  For instance, the F bomb automatically makes a movie rated R.  However the former elements are put into a movie combined with a spooky-fantasy aspect and it is a family film.  Oh well I suppose this is why I never made it in the movie business.   
 You would do better to actually use the money spent on this book and buy a drink on your next cruise.  Horror of horrors, the cruise ship industry is out to make money!!!  Shocking facts such as these as well as those that pay for premium suites get extra benefits and perks (shocking) can all be learned from this book.  The author did a wonderful job of investigative research by basing most of his facts by talking to a disgruntled waiter over dinner.  Thirty cruises is not what I would call extensive experience in the cruise ship industry.  One cruise ship had a problem with its' air conditioner so the author assumes that ALL cruise ships have a problem with air conditioning (or they just turn it off to save money).  This book is a waste of time and money and I will continue to cruise despite his efforts 
 Anyone thinking of buying this book---don't. You will find better fiction in a D.C. or Marvel comic. I don't know what is being smoked by these reviewers, but it beats the heck out of the peyote they apparently have in Wyoming 
 It is really not practical, especially when you are cooking on all four burners of your stove since there is only one small hole to put your spoons in.  If you put it on the stove it be careful, because it gets hot by the vent on the oven 
 About two-thirds of this campily illustrated and ultimately light-weight book consists of inspirational essays on the girliness of traditionally female tasks such as gardening, decorating, cooking, and entertaining. In this vein, the odd "helpful hint" tells us to sew tassels to our curtains, toast bread crumbs atop our packaged mac-and-cheese, and hold gardening parties in our least-loved bridesmaid dresses. Oh, and let's not forget painting the garden tools pink with polka-dots!  Some of the advice conflicts. On page 25, we're told that Elsie de Wolfe believed in "plenty of optimism and white paint!" Ten pages later, we're told we mustn't have white walls at all -- so boring! Who's right?  This book seems destined to be given as going-to-college and thanks-for-wearing-an-ugly-bridesmaid-dress gifts, due to its high cuteness quotient. As useful housekeeping advice, forget it 
 I have greatly enjoyed the Anita Blake series previous to this installment, even going back to re-read many of them several times.  However, I found "Danse Macabre" disappointing. While the imagery and characters are solid and well-developed, this individual book greatly lacks for a plotline. The characters spend so much time having sex that they don't really get out of bed until somewhere after the first 400 pages, then they go to the ballet, which is interrupted by an emergency sex scene, then they finish watching the ballet, talk to someone at a dance club, then it's back into bed for more sex for the remainder of the book. This felt like a half-developed idea for a short story, propped up with 500 pages of extraneous sex.  Still, the endless sex scenes are very well written. If you enjoy detailed, passionate, sensual, group sex, erotica narrative, you will enjoy this book very much. However, if you are hoping for the exciting mystery and adventure of the previous thirteen Anita Blake novels, you will find none of that here.  On the bright side, the excerpt of the next book, while containing one sex scene, also contains a scene in which Anita interviews a client in her office. That does seem to suggest that an actual mystery may be addressed in book 15. Here's hoping 
 Because watercolor colours name's aren't the same as acrylic and oil, it just doesn't make sense at all to me, and to say "made easy" I didn't think so, but i'm sure it's a great book for watercolorists 
 Boring!! I was disappointed.  In fact, I disliked it so much, I only finished about 3/4 of the book.  That is very uncommon for me as I alway push through as I want to give the author a chance to turn it around.  I just could not do it with this book 
 I was pleased to see a new "supersized" history of WWII box set come to DVD, and being a superfan of this subject bought it.  I wasn't expecting a lot of new footage but I thought perhaps a new perspective would be refreshing.    I'm afraid disappointed is an understatement in describing how I felt while watching it...  "War Chronicles" (Mort Zimmerman) was never my favorite of the WWII documentaries, and this box set is built entirely on these old reels.    Patrick O'Neal's voice drones on like the engines of a tired old bomber on a long run to the heart of Germany.  You hear little else but his narration over the canned sound effects through the entire series.    I was particularly amazed at the lack of footage devoted to England and the Battle of Britain.  Literally a couple of minutes!    A far better choice would be the "BBC History of World War II", The "Definitive History of WWII" (Brentwood), "Visions of War" (Southern Star/IMAVision), or "The World at War" box sets.    If you still wish to have this box set, there will be plenty of very slightly used copies available very cheap, very soon!    
 OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.  The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?  Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics 
 Sheer new age nonsense. Don't waste your time. I could pull quotes out of it all day long that would make you laugh out loud, and I'm talking about quotes where Jackson is dead serious. If he is what passes for an intellectual in the NBA, then the NBA is in trouble 
 I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas, having loved other Parents brand toys we've bought for her. My daughter's initial reaction was fear. It's extremely loud, and needlessly so. I suppose the level of noise is supposed to imitate that of a real car, but it's really just annoying if you're a parent, and a little scary if you're a one-year old.   Once she became acclamated to the level of noise it made, it did hold her interest. At the very least she found the remote to be a good chew toy, and was pleasantly surprised that the button on it did in fact move the car about. Assuming she was close enough to the car. Someone said the range is about 15 feet. Maybe they modified our model of the car to be even crappier. Once the car got about 4-5 feet away, it was hesitant to respond and acted a bit squirrely even when it did respond. At 15 feet (less, really) the remote became totally useless.  I figured in time my daughter would get the hang of all these nuiances and it would probably provide a few minutes of entertainment here and there. Time was not on our side. The toy broke less than two weeks after Christmas. The remote no longer works at all - and the batteries are fine. The car will turn on, and noisily sit there with its flashing lights, but that's it. Needless to say, the small token of fun value this toy had is gone.  Don't waste your money on this toy - it's a guaranteed disappointment 
 This book is as bad as his radio show.  Edell is a pompous fool.  He never met a drug he didn't like. The answer to every problem is a prescription drug.  In addition, he believes people should have the freedom to use non-prescription drugs like marijuana and cocaine.  Yet, we shouldn't have the freedom to use supplements like vitamins and herbs.  He wants the medical industry and the government to take control of those.  He has an inferiority complex because he was never circumcised and was made fun of as a kid because of it.  He rails against circumcision despite overwhelming evidence showing its value.  Edell is the type of guy that gives doctors a bad reputation.  He thinks he knows it all and that people are too ignorant to make decisions about their health 
 Because of the infinite complexity of human behavior, attempts to explain it are almost wholly speculative - especially when the subject is as complex as war.  With no nod to that reality, Mr. Hanson unimaginatively adopts the popular myths of the ideological right to explain what he believes has been an unbroken history of Western military dominance.  Some of the reasons that he offers are capitalism, freedom, and individualism.  He should be writing political speeches, not history.  His theories are just plain silly.    If you can skim through the countless repetitive passages, much of his descriptive material is, however, interesting 
 I had never come across a book that was literally a chore to read, until I got this book.  Abysmal doesn't begin to describe it.  Imagine the most foul, putrid, rancid, vile odor that can possibly come from the depths of a rat-infested sewer, and that is Chanel No. 5 compared to this book.  I swear Benford's writing is so bad, he makes Stephen Baxter seem like a good author.  I literally feel like a part of my life has been taken from me by reading this.  Unfortunately, I willingly gave it away, which raises the question:  Who is the greater fool?  The fool who wrote the book?  Or the fool who bought that fool's book?  The problem with Benford and some other sci-fi authors who take pride in getting the science right is that they forget the second word:  fiction.  Asimov was an exception.  He not only got his science right, but he made the story enjoyable.  That's a lesson that Benford would do well to learn and take to heart.  This should not be a science textbook.  First and foremost, it's a STORY!  Alongside the science, Benford seems to take pride in using as many big words as possible.  Now don't get me wrong, a large vocabulary has its place.  That being said, I am not of the opinion that the casual reader should have to have Foundation's Fear in one hand and a dictionary in the other to make sense of what Benford is trying to say.  Note to Benford:  Believe it or not, there are blue-collar people who like to read science fiction novels.  I was planning on purchasing Benford's Galactic Center series.  But if this is the type of writing one can expect from Benford, I'll probably just skip it. 
 I picked this book up because I was intrigued by the title.  Unfortunately, it only took me seconds to see that the author had a very specific ideology that was ignoring other psychological and historical viewpoints.   For example, the author points out that "adults are on time" and that being late is an "act of passive aggressiveness."  While this can be true many times, it is certainly not true all the time.  Anyone who knows the Jungian based Myers-Briggs personality test will know that "perceivers" are notoriously late because they get easily distracted while "judgers" are frequently early for every appointment.  But in the author's world, only the "J" personality type is "mature."  Another statement the author makes, on the very same page, is that being adult means "raising your own children."  Sounds fair on its face.  However, it ignores historical and economic facts.  The nuclear family of two parents and children is a 20th century creation.  In the past, societies had extended families that were heavily involved in the rearing of the children while parents worked.  This is still true in many societies even today.  So how does this become a definition of maturity across the board?  I don't get it.  Obviously, people shouldn't just have children willy-nilly and ignore their needs.  But the author's perspective is pretty much B&W.  Their is no gray.  (IMO, this is in itself a statement of immaturity.)  The whole thing just smacks of a certain political mindset.  My advice: Take the Myers-Briggs test, find out what you are, figure out what parts of your personality need some work.  This is a far better solution than having this author spoon feed you her personal views 
 I had to buy this book for my Organic Class and I hate it! If I am going to pay textbook prices for a book, I expect it to be professionally written, not shifting into first and second person and speaking in sentence fragments. I was supposed to keep it for 2nd semester, but I hated it so much I sold it back after first semester was over. What a waste of money. 
 Bought it 2 months ago for in-door usage, thought it'd last until the end of the semester. After less than a couple of weeks of normal everyday usage, punctures started to appear, and the patches that came along with the package didn't help much. Even though the design and the built-in manual pump is a big plus, the quality is very disappointing 
 I was disappointed with my purchase.   The first two tapes in the series were fine, but when I inserted the 3rd tape into my machine the tape started feeding out the front of the machine.  I checked the tape and the wheels or sprockets they were wound on were loose and free floating inside the plastic casing.  I, then examined the other remaining cassettes and 4 of the 8 had the same problem.  I wonder if these products were seconds or something?  I would not order from this vendor again because it could have ruined my machine and because it is a hassle to have to return merchandise in today's busy work world.  
 Save your money and leave this book on the shelf. This guide to summer programs is disorganized and unclear. Moreover, most of the information is duplicated in its heftier sibling, Peterson's "Summer Opportunities for Kids and Teenagers" 
 Not what I expected at all. The actual show didnt really have to do alot with teaching the letters. You have to go to the special features to get all the letters and it is so boring. The Leap Frog Letter Factory is so much better in my opinion and it also teaches letter sounds not just the letters alone and it does it in such a fun way. 
 I absolutely love Janet Evanovich and the Stephanie Plum series, so when I saw this new series of books with her name on it, I grabbed them up.  I couldn't even finish reading this book.  It was so bad.  The whole talking car concept was, frankly, just stupid.  This was like watching an episode of Knight Rider, but without David Hasselhoff.  The characters are flat, and the dialogue is stilted and contrived.  I can only believe that Charlotte Hughes did most of the writing, and why on earth would Evanovich attach her name to this?  Needless to say, I will not be reading the rest of the series.  Spend your money on something worth reading 
 If I could give it a zero or negative rating I would.  When VIBE was introduced, it was a relevant, interesting magazine that exposed me to new alternative, r&b and hip hop artists.  The mag featured all kinds of artists not just who's hot right now, it also featured hard hitting expose articles that were relevant to not only the hip hop community but the world.  Lately I've noticed that it's nothing more than a fluffy version of The Source.  I hate a lot of new rap music that's out and didn't appreciate mags with rappers I dislike on the cover. And is it me or does it seem like since Mimi took over, all of the female r&b singers' covers and stories are HORRIBLE (we won't even discuss that disgusting Brandy cover)!  This magazine SUCKS now and the only time I check it out is while I'm in line at the grocery store.  Yes, the subscription rates are cut to the bone now but that is because the quality is supremely lacking.  I'd advise the curious to check issues out at newstands or where ever before wasting your hard earned money on a subscription 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 Oh, boy...I've read some bad books; unfortunately, this is right up there with the books I've liked the least.  I read some of this book on the subway and I had to really struggle to keep going.  there is not much of a plot and what there is suggests the old saying "a book in which not much happens rather slowly."  as for the investigative reporting, well, my comment is that I've read an account of the real thing - a substance that kills people (see An Air That Kills about the asbestos poisoning of Libby, Montana) - and I mean really, this is beyond a bad joke.   Juvenile in the extreme.  And the sex scenes were disgusting.  I have no problem with explicit sex, but I don't like a "When Harry Met Sally"-type restaurant encounter in which Rebecca is concerned with whether Max had cut his toenails.  Yuck!  Rebecca was unable to say no to anyone.  She can't say no to her grandmother who insists she stay for a surprise dinner; she stands up Max to stay, and of course it works out.  In real life she might not get another chance with Max.  Lipstick and then Jess and the baby move in and commandeer the apartment and somehow, this is OK.  Of course it all works out in the end, this being chick-lit.  And the way the story was told: so much was told, and not shown, and so much of what was put in is unbelievably boring.  Trivial conversations and minute details of the characters' actions and emotions.  Where have all the editors gone 
 This was to go to my son who chose it in his wish list. Instead it is coming to me and I can get no response. PLEASE SEND THIS TO MY SON AND NOT TO M 
 I had high hopes for this book since it is set in Mississippi and since I was under the impression that it had to do a bit with music from my generation.  However, if I had wanted a book exclusively designed around music, who wrote it, who recorded it, when they did it (both), what category it arguably falls in, and what arguments for and against each and every song from each and every album, and so on, ad nauseum, I would have just bought a book on music history covering the late 60's and early 70's. I know there must be a story somewhere in the 350+ pages, but I don't have the patience to skip the endless blather about songs and singers in between mentions of the plot that reading the whole thing would require.  I wouldn't bother with anything else written by this author 
 I had this professor for a history of economics class and she writes just as she teaches; listlessly.  She meanders all over the place and will often throw in what she perceives as relevant information, but isn't about her trip to the Great Wall of China in the middle of discussing the pyshiocrats.  This book is bombastic in language, excessive in wordiness, and it will make you fall asleep by mid paragraph. Seriously, skip this book.  It is by far the worst economics book I've ever read 
 The information was presented in simple language for the non-statistician. It was helpful to consider how statistics are presented and how they can be interpreted. The examples were outdated 
 Shark Attack is an interesting tale of deceit and stolen shark footage.  The movie features some computer harpooning police men and a crazy fisherman turned taxi driver.  The most interesting part is all the shark footage...  The best scene is after the bad guy/hotel owner is eaten, the shark clearly shown with a hook in it's mouth being pulled towards a boat.  This of course has nothing at all to do with the plot.  So where did this hook come from?  It was probably I was trying to stab in my eyes to stop the pain of this movie 
 This book was not actually written by "Larry the Cable Guy," but a gentleman named Dan Whitney.  Whitney is the human being who plays the character "Larry the Cable Guy" in concerts, movies, TV shows, CDs, and now this book.  What Dan Whitney really thinks about anything is up for conjecture, but he certainly knows what he wants people to think his character "Larry the Cable Guy" thinks.  In that way, this book succeeds marvelously, it makes fun of all the things Whitney has observed as making LTCG fans mad, and like president they all voted for, he tells them what something is and whether it is good, bad, or funny (i.e., jesus = good, fart = funny, being retarded = funny, not supporting the Bush administration = bad) and requires only confirmation by repetition of the catch phrase title of the book, and purchase of sundry items bearing the same inscription.  It is brilliantly targeted and presented for maximum cash-in value, with very little discussion and no thought involved at all.  It is the easiest thing in the world to be a  Larry fan because you don't even have to know what is funny, good, or bad, just wait for Larry to sum it up in the simplest little joke imaginable.   That is because he has calculated that if he talks in a thick southern accent (the origin of which is never revealed because it is an amalgam) people will think "wow, he really must be a down to earth fellow to unabashadly parade his hick background instead of trying to "unhickify" himself to reach a wider audience.  The unhickified Dan Whitney was boring and not funny, so he devised the Larry character to play on people who thought a brash, "honest" guy from the south was more funny.  It's a beautiful formula, and Larry is a gazillionaire as a result.    He may have paid  a few visits to a Waffle House to take notes, but you can be assured that establishment does not cater the spread on Dan Whitney's Gulfstream V.  So if you're wondering whether Larry sounds like he's from east Texas, western Louisiana, central Alabama, northeast Arkansas, Northen Florida, southern South Carolina, or smack dab in the middle of Georgia, don't labor too hard, he comes from Nebraska and the accent is fake.  Just like all the heartfelt nonsense in this book he is simply describing what he thinks the big fans of LTCG want to hear.  So if you want to be told what you want to hear by what is basically a cartoon character, instead of engaging in thought about a real human being, then welcome to the world of Larry The Cable Guy.  Just like Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, and Jesus, he's not real.  Is that un-PC enough for you, Dan 
 I actually quite enjoyed this book until the last few pages. The individual stories of the pilgrims are relatively interesting (if a bit clumsy), all having some connection with Hyperion. Progress towards the story's climax on Hyperion seemed slow, but I assumed there would be some kind of closure to the story, which would also lead on to the next book in the series. Sadly, there is no closure to the story, leaving me feeling cheated. Most authors are able to find a good balance between providing a satisfactory ending to one story, and leaving you keen for the next one. Most annoying of all, the author completely pulled me out of his fictional world by dropping in a trite and annoying reference to 20th century fiction at the very end. I felt like the joke was on me, the author was deliberately trying to disrupt my suspension of disbelief. I'm disappointed, I feel betrayed by the cheap ending, and I shan't bother reading any further in the series. 
 "The Goal" was a great book but Goldratt is trying to continue to cash in on that success with this book.  It is remarkably poorly written and an absolute waste of time.  Not one new useful piece of knowledge in this book 
 If there is a passage that defines this book, it's the one on page 74, where he uses his superior intellect and social conservatism to declare that "...[the human assembler of pre-manufactured parts] is not necessarily a bad man. It merely means that his education in his trade has been bad."   What an amazing nugget of wisdom from a man who browbeats the greater population for our consumption of mass-manufactured objects. No, David, assemblers who aren't emotionally or pridefully connected to the object are just deficient people, worthy of the utmost contempt. Start up a death camp if they bother that bad, Nazi bastard. Labor thanks you for your morsels of understanding and forgiveness.  Don't waste your money. Don't make ugly work 
 I must take issue with one of the claims made by the author about this book. He says that it is the only book you will ever need on the subject.  This is patently not true.  Don't get me wrong, there is some stuff worth reading in this book, but it is _suggestive_, not _definitive_. For example, his Clairvoyance and Clairaudience exercises are interesting. Also, the descriptions of the fifty spirits is useful - assuming that they are taken from his own magical diary.  But elsewhere, Konstantinos makes a bit of a hash with his presentation of the Golden Dawn-style of magic, no more obvious than in his treatment of Enochian magic, which is woeful. This is a complex subject in itself, so much so that authors like Aleister Crowley and more recently John Michael Greer have recognised that it can't be handled adequately in a book which is only general in its terms.  My advice: read it if you want - or better still borrow it from a lending library if you want! - but there _are_ other books on the subject which should be read to get a more balanced view. (See, e.g. Crowley, Greer, Lon Milo Duquette, Poke Runyon, etc).  
 Do not buy this book unless you have a very high tolerance for new age gibberish.  There is factual information here, but it is buried in gushy self-absorption.  I bought it for psychotherapy patients who are going through menopause, but I'd be embarrassed to lend it out 
 Mr. Hayes appears intelligent on TV, but when you get into this book you find how uninformed he really is. Many un-named sources and hearsay evidence does make for a document of fact. Do not waste your time with this pack of lies. If you do read it you will know why you can buy get "111 used & new available from $1.48." Buy it and you'll just make it 112 available. 
 Zukav has a decidedly anti-Western tone and is obviously biased in favor of oriental thinking.  This is new age gobbledegook passed off as a bare bones reader on physics.  Rather than writing a laconic outline of physics, Zukav spends the majority of his time praising Eastern thought and toying with the idea that everything is subjective.    The reader is referred to any college physics textbook or Isaac Asimov's History of Physics or a good set of encylopedias.   
 If Paleo people were so fit and healthy why do authors of this book put so much empahsis on importance of sports drinks? How about soda bicarbonate to improve one's performance, or caffeine? So where do we draw the line? Either promote NATURAL way of nourishing our bodies or lets have a list of supplements (as long as they are still legal) to give an athlete the edge. Too bad our ancestors did not have access to energy jels 
 I bought this to avoid buing and expensive mandoline to make my sweet potato fries.  What I leared is... the sweet potatoes are too hard for this cutter to work well.  Neither my husband or I could get the sweet potato to cut.  We had to take it out and chop them by hand.  It works very good on regular and smaller potatoes though 
 Not as much fun as I remember. Maybe better if they had a better selection of games (One on One, Hardball, etc. 
 Scientific? I couldn't get more disgusted.  This review is written because it can accomplish much, that is, let no one science-interrested person fall in this trap.  I did never read more than 20% of the book, that is a short one, I can only guess that its because there would been to much nonsens even for the most naive readers. I read until I had heard to much about the "revoloutionating discovery" (that you have not heard of in serious papers as Nature or New Scientist, why?)  This revaloutionary discovery etc. was a machine build by someone, that claims it could measure feelings, so for example it could measure in a black room when there was a big group of people feeling the same thing, maybe an OS contestant from USA (where the machine would be) winning the championship in whatever.  Well, then it was tested in superbowl but failed, the author explains this due to commecials distorting the feelings the public felt etc...  How would this machine be able to notice somethings like this? Well they must have checked out a list of "strange" topics from physics and chosen zero point energy that has to do with the vacuum. They could not choose something like electromagnetism, because that might be disregared right away by the public who might know to much about it.  Claims that the machine is working is based on odds for it not to be this way were apperently about 1:1000 (I don't doubt that more than 1000 of these experiments have been made and failed) The author also claims that there was a scientific explaination with the feeling an moon astronaut felt when he was away from earth, he felt connected to earth in some kind of way.  I laugh in disgust, noticing this book is nothing, absolutely nothing, compared to others that actually stand out as great books, giving you an "WOOOW!" but with a scientificually accepted material as background. Examples of these are:  QED: The strange theory of light and matter by Richard Feynman, who was one of three to individually invent Quantum Electro Dynamics, that is the most fundamental description of Electromagnetism. This book is based on a series of lectures Feynman made in University of Auckland, New Zeeland, to a PUBLIC audience.  Deep Down Things: The Breathtaking Beauty of Particle Physics by Bruce A. Schumm. A book staying focused on the subject that lies around particle physics, a Wooow! I got from this book was the connections between the mathematical Lee Groups and the quantum forces of nature (electromagnetism, the weak force, the strong force), discribed greatly on a non professional level 
 As a careful student of scripture who uses scripture to explain scripture, I was severely disappointed by this book. A single example will serve to show why everyone should avoid this work.  The Seals, Trumpets, and Bowls take up 11 of the 22 chapters of the book of Revelation. They are saturated with Old Testament quotations and allusions. Yet LaHaye doesn't use a single Old Testament passage to help him explain these three series. This is completely inexcusable. But even more, when he considers the first horseman (the first Seal), he completely ignores Revelation's own use of the symbolism of "white robes" and the "crown" (Greek: stephanos, the crown given to the righteous). By doing this, he turns the meaning of this symbol completely on its head.  No one should read this book for anything other than a good example of how not to read the Bible 
 you can see by the name that this band is aother coporate creation to the masses of 10 year old girls tryin' to be hip  and weepin' at the sickly lyrics of "the reason" god when i first heard that song i cried..not because it's a beautiful poetic song with passion and superb word-play it's because it made me nauseous i was ready to spill my guts on the breakfast i'd just ate  are these guys tryin' to be hip or are just marketted to sell  buckle loads of records to the mtv for the price of the decency of rock and roll  i one know it's the second   there name hooba-stank is a double edged sword because  when music fans see the name and cd on their local cd stores  they think "well they've got to be good because they've got stank in their name and any band they purposely puts stank in their name is gonna be bad right?"

 Simply put this is an amazing sounding record.  I think I just expected genious.  It's understandable that the critics and mags are all hot over it.  It's just weird.  Sometimes you just don't like something right off,  it's odd that it could be output from a musician you highly regard.  It may take some time, but I will anticipated that this disc could grow on me.  
 L&M were so much more than what this represents....and I won't even discuss the Angry Eyes issue. L&M were also more than a pop/radio group that I have seen mentioned here. They had many songs which featured more of a jazz feel. I would highly recommend you only buy their studio releases as there were not that many. A greatest hits release just does not do them justice 
 As a feminist, I hate movies that portray women as victims who struggle futile against the big bad evil MAN.  There are no good men in this movie.  There are no evil women.   Such portrayals of women are demeaning.  We are human beings, just like men.  We are capable of evil.  Men are capable of good.  Yes, some men would turn their wives into robots if they could, but so would some women!  And I find it ridiculous that not one man stood up for his beloved partner.  I find it ridiculous that not one woman was capable of true evil.  Are we puppets?  It also bothers me that if these women are so strong and powerful, that they are helpless against the big bad men.  The message seems to be that we can't save ourselves.  We are just doomed to be what men want us to be.  I hate this attitude.  Men are not all powerful.  Women are human beings, not saints.    Two stars, though, for capturing the fears of women everywhere 
 My thoughts about this book can be summed up by a quote by Lanfear herself:  "you don't use one tenth of your potential".  The most frustrating element of this book (and the series as a whole, for that matter) is the wasted potential.  The world of this series was so vividly realized and the plot was complex and engaging.  Now, it is difficult not to sit back and wonder where exactly Jordan went off track.  Most other reviewers commented on the fact that all the characters did not "miraculously" end up in the same place for the last battle.  Personally, I found it very disapointing.  Three of the four plot lines are resolved satisfactorally (even the Nynaeve/Elaine one...though I will admit it wrapped up too neatly and had me hoping at the end that the Black Ajah would come back at the last minute and wipe the self satisfied smile off Nynaeve's face).  Even so, I was left wondering whether the weeks I'd spent reading this book were worth it.    What this book lacked most was direction.  It was very much a filler book for the characters/readers to take a breather in between major plot movements (at least I think that was what the original idea was).  Readers can debate about whether the book was a success or not until they turn blue in the face (as I know they will) but for me, the book (and the series a sa whole) has fallen very flat 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 As a South African acquaintance said to me... "I've never been able to finish a Gordimer book". I decided I would finish this book, and it is well written if in an archingly intellectual manner. But its tough  going...too detached, and ultimately not enough to keep you wanting to go  back. I chose it at random since I had heard so much about Nadine Gordimer,  but had never read any of her work.  Suggest finding another one 
 HOLY CRAP...I MUST HAVE GOTTEN A DIFFERENT VERSION OF THIS DVD THAN THE OTHER REVIEWERS.FIRST OF ALL, THIS MAN COULD'T SING IN IN KEY TO SAVE HIS LIFE. THE WHOLE PRODUCTION REAKS OF OVER PRODUCTION. MEAT LOAF WITH A SYMPHONY...GIVE ME A BREAK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!HOW MEATLOAF MUSIC LENDS ITSELF TO A SYMPHONY IS A REAL STRETCH AT BEST. I WATCHED ABOUT 45 MINUTES OF THIS CRAP JUST TO MAKE SURE I WASN'T OFF BASE AND THAT WAS MORE THAN ENOUGH.I OWN OVER 250 DVD CONCERTS AND THIS ONE DIDN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO MAKING THE CUT TO BE IN MY COLLECTION. IT GOT TRADED IN THE NEXT DAY................SORRY MEATLOAF, YOU'RE A BETTER ACTOR THAN MUSICIAN AND THATS NOT SAYING MUCH....................... 
 I guess my disappointment is so acute because I had such high hopes. After reading the blurb I couldn't wait to start.  But oh,  what a disaster. A team of scientists investigates whether the cause of modern violence is a "virus" or at least neurological in nature. In a sense it's the old nature vs nurture argument. They interview serial killers and war criminals for research at brain differences. The first half of the book (each chapter about 4 pages) is pure fluff - the author drones on about society, race, culture, troubled marriages, etc  Book II concerns the kidnapping of the woman scientist and the search for her.    Let's start with the characters or should I say caricatures? The television preacher is a slick Southerner with a Messiah complex, the businessman is a greedy, scheming CEO, the religious folks are wacky fanatics, the black woman scientist is beautiful and ultra-intelligent, her white husband is intellectual and troubled and their child is adorable, outstanding, etc.  You get the picture.  There is almost as much discussion about race, gender and culture as there is about violence. (PC Passwords are GHANDI & MANDELA in case we didn't get the point.)  It's an interracial marriage, what's the big deal?   But it's the premise that really bombs.  The book reads like the  televangelist it mocks - the world is evil, conspiracies are everywhere, our modern lifestyle has ruined society.  Does the author seriously suggest that violence is worst today than, say, in 2000 BC or 50 AD or 1200 AD or even 1900 AD?  If so, he is mistaken for while individual violence is flashed across our screens 24/7 thanks to the instantaneous media, the level of cultural violence continues to decline.   More problems:  The author's knowledge of the corporate world are straight out of a made-for-TV special or perhaps an NPR editorial  rather than the real world.  The scientists are hardly treated better since the vast majority deal with the mundane and not international intrigue, murder, kidnapping or discoveries that startle the world. And am I the only one that noticed now answer was given to the "virus" question? Instead we have the usual candidates - government conspiracies, electricity, chemicals, population, religion and evolutionary psychology.  So, is/was there a virus? The author assures us the answer to that lies in combining scientific research and religion.  Now THAT'S original (LOL) 
 It seems to me that this author is trying to tell us he is tired of Lucas Davenport.  I feel that he wants to transplant the best of Davenport to a new hero.If so, he failed.  If that is the case, he failed. There are long stretches of boring reading and suddenly a spark of the old haro comes through to us.  Worth to read if you cannot fall asleep; after some half a dozen pages, you can. How sad.. 
 Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist .The author is a anthropologist in real life and I feel she gave to much detail as to body parts & conditions ,& locations in the book , and in about the 3rd chapter to much time and space is wasted talking about "Gabby " including in detail where gabby lives and details that surround the outside of Gabbys place & How Gabby and Tempe were friends from GRad to man parts in life . Book was not for me I dropped it at the 3rd chapter . 
 This is an extremely dry anime.  The manga version by Masamune Shirow is filled with bits of humor.  Not so for the anime.  The character Batou was especially funny in the manga, but, for reasons unknown, he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version. Expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking.  These really make the movie crawl.  One minute there's action, next you're listening to Matoko or Batou go on and on about existentialism.  Seriously, these little talks, take up 3/4 of the movie. The visuals are awesome, no question about that.  Even so, they do not fulfill the need for SOME kind of thread of a story.  Altogether, not much actually, HAPPENS during the movie. If you must see it, rent it first to be sure you want it 
 As other have stated, the performance is excellent.  My wife and I watched this in vegas and thoroughly enjoyed the show.  With that said, my review is for the extremely poor job the video editor did. They used some kind of filter on many of the shots.  They change camera angles 50 times in 1 minute to the point that is unbearable and painful to watch.  You do not get to see the dancers perform any full steps because the angle switches before they finish it.  Additionally they use these slow motion segments that totally ruin the moment and create the unsynchronized dance with the music.  I have to sell my copy because I get nauseas watching it.  I hope they re-make this DVD.  I think my 7-year old daughter could do a better job editing...and we could use the additional revenue stream... 
 I grew up in the '50s and my Mother had several cookbooks but "Joy of Cooking" was the bible. All my childhood favorites come from the book and when I moved out on my own it was the basic cookbook on which I relied. I bought a more recent version about 15 to 20 years ago but it wasn't as good. This is NOT the version with which I grew up. It's recipes are few, very dated, and, mostly, uninteresting. If you like oysters there's several.  An interesting read for it's historical and sociologic value but not worth purchasing for the recipes themselves. Frankly, there are no recipes that I would try because either they are boring or they have been updated by more interesting versions 
 In the right hands this novel could be translated into an exciting movie.  The premise is interesting, but falls completely flat with the sewn up ending.  A true happily ever after, that begs for a more smartly written sequel in which everything unravels would be delicious.  The hardest aspect to swallow was that this super extra terrestrial life form could divide out of control then just be neatly killed and carried to a lab in the desert for benevolent study.  Sheesh!  I really thought it was going to get scary at some point! The major antagonist of the story is a tattoed up ex inmate who fancies himself a master mind killer-when in reality he is just a sharpshooting (except when it really counts) boob!  And boy does he meet his match in a simple pair of desert folk, who happen to be expert gunslingers and survivalists to boot!  This is all very funny, but to me the funniest part of the entire book is the description of the male tyrannasaur mounting the female and trumpeting loudly in the wild prehistoric world he inhabits!!!! 
 Reading this book reminded me of how you sometimes watch a bad movie just to see how bad it can get.  I did a lot skimming (fast forwarding) to see if it was consistent right up to the end.  It was.  Don't waste your time.  This was my first Iles book and will surely be my last 
 I was very disappointed by this novel. Roth is a talented writer, and I had hoped that he would be able to create a truly compelling novel out of such a promising idea. However, the novel just didn't work for me. The characters felt something like cardboard cut outs and seemed inconsistent in their behavior. The plot spun out of control and became completely fantastic and quite unbelievable. Read something else by Roth - I think you'll enjoy one of his earlier works more than this 
 As an Eco fan, I could not wait to read his latest novel. Sadly, I was deeply disappointed by this pompous, self-indulgent, virtually unreadable monster. The cultural and literary references are obscure and incomprehensible unless you are a 70-something Italian librarian.    
 Very miss leading title, has nothing to do with Wild Orchid, which was a fantastic movie. I found it disappointing 
 I have never been able to see what the big deal was about this band.  All of their records, in general, sound exactly the same, and this one is no exception.  Post-Velvets guitar/organ drones, lackadaisical vocals, blankly uninteresting non-lyrics (they could have recited their grocery lists and it would have been more interesting), and a dramatic lack of energy; all of Yo La Tengo's trademarks are fully represented here, and if you can stay awake through it, you're a better man/woman than I.  A surpassingly boring record, even from this usually very boring band.  If you've heard the Velvet Underground, Neu!, Stereolab's early records, and Sonic Youth, you've heard Yo La Tengo in total.  If you're a big enough fan of those named bands, YOU could probably write songs that sound like "Painful." But you would probably write better ones. Avoid this like the plague unless you suffer from insomnia 
        I am surprised that so many people gave this trash a decent rating. While this book certainly holds your attention, the author, by his own admission, says the book is based on "fact" and the author's fantasy.  And what a fantasy it is! It seems if he can find something negative to say or something sexual, he fantasizes about it and writes it.     That alone should serve as a warning, yet I read this book in my library's biography section, not the fiction section.     Rosen's other claim to fame is his admission that he began the project by working with Fred Seaman, and later became a turncoat against Seaman. He even went to far as to run to Yoko and spill his guts so Yoko could use this information against Seaman in court either at the civil or criminal prosecution. What a backstabbing jerk. So you know right away that Yukko had some say or influence in the content of this book. Otherwise, why allow Rosen to release it?       I would probably have given this book 3 stars if, right from the beginning, the author admitted that this was a fiction.  But to pass this off as a biography is dishonest and deceiving 
 This book is important for the historian who wishes to get a glimpse into the workings of the mind of an important figure in American Revolutionary history, but it doesn't stand on its own. It is written almost entirely as a response to Edmund Burke's "Reflections on the Revolution in France", so I would not recommend reading this one until and unless one has read that one. Otherwise, it is impossible to judge the fairness of the rebuttals of Burke's points, as one only sees them through Paine's perspective, and Paine is far from a fair and impartial debater; he misses no opportunity to belittle his opponent's arguments, and even his opponent himself. I would not be at all surprised to discover that he gives an inaccurate picture of what Burke had to say, particularly given that history speaks rather better of Burke's misgivings than of Paine's panegyrics. Both books were written before the Reign of Terror that resulted from the revolution in 1793; the second part of this book came out in early 1792. Also, history shows us just how silly some of Paine's claims for a Republican, representative government are: 200+ years of representative government in the US have hardly banished wars, or the high taxes associated with them, even though the world as a whole is far more democratic than it was at his time. He makes some good points, and certainly it is hard to stand up against him in favor of hereditary monarchy, but it is apparent that he failed to see that not ALL "democratic" movements were necessarily benificent, even if it would be hard to have much sympathy for the autocratic regime that they overthrow 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 i used to follow politics but now i know better. clinton is a hero to poor folk in the US only bc bush is such a nazi, sorry, but clinton did more than any pres in US history to cut welfare to the moms who need it the most! i ain't no fool partisan of a richmans party and i don't like america. and yes i'm born and raised in the US, there is no democracy here, only a moneycracy!!! power to the ppl lets make a real country for the ppl, not the capitalist leech scum!! 
 I'm on page 110 of this book. The book has 220 pages. I'm half way done and the author has not as of yet given me 1 valuable peace of information to help me forgive the person I am angry with. I bought this book because I have a lot of anger in me and the preface and reviews from other well know authors sold me on it with the belief that this book would help me. But, it is having the opposite affect. I feel I was duped into buying it (because of the promises in the introduction and the glowing reviews). Part 1 tells us what a "grievance" is. It tells us, and tells us again, and again, and again. The thing is  I ALREADY KNOW what a grievance is! I KNOW I'm angry at someone, and I know it's not healthy, I know to forgive would help me.... I didn't need that to be explained to me over and over again for 59 pages. All that reading did was make me dwell and think MORE about the problem AND increased my anger because of the book itself. When I reached "Part 2", entitles "Forgiveness" I thought FINALLY.... but all Part 2 has done is repeat what is in part 1 and what is in the introduction - how great the study was and how much it will help me. There are some great reviews of this book here at Amazon and if this book helped some people that is great. But so far I can't agree with any of the positive comments. I have a great degree of respect for Stanford University, I went to high school across the street from Stanford and have taken classes there, but it pains me to have such a great school's name attached to this book. Is it fair of me to write a review of a book I have not finished? No... but I'm afraid to continue reading it. I'm already angry and to buy a book that I thought would help me, only to find it frustrating me, I don't feel is not all that fair either...... 
 I bought the book on a recommendation a year back and tried to read it but failed to concentrate enough as it was a pretty dense book. Recently I picked it up again, this time determined to finish it as it is considered an important work.  I have forced myself and it takes forever to get through a single page. Either the author or the translator did a lousy job. I wonder if the original is easier to decipher. I ended up putting the book down on page 111 (a third into the book). Do not waste your time with this book. Foucault may have been a great philosopher who had an impact on many other scholars but I wouldn't know because i cant understand what he wrote.   HAHAHAHAH LET ME DEMONSTRATE WHAT I MEAN AS I QUOTE FROM THE BOOK (p.23), SEE IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT HE IS SAYING ON YOUR FIRST TRY:  "Instead of treating the history of penal law and the history of the human sciences as two separate series whose overlapping appears to have had on one or the other, or perhaps on both, a disturbing or useful effect, according to one's point of view, see whether there is not some common matrix or whether they do not both derive from a single process of 'epistemologico-juridical' formation; in short, make the technology of power the very principle both of the humanization of the penal system and the knowledge of man."  NOT AS BAD AS FINNEGAN's WAKE, but it sure comes close 
      Millet attempts in his book to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. The author addresses a controversial subject; namely, is Mormonism Christian? While he uses somewhat persuasive arguments (convincing Mormons, the uninformed, and those unknowledgeable in sound Christian doctrine), his arguments don't hold up under the light of Biblical truth. Having spent 26 years of my life as a devout Mormon, and leaving Mormonism for a saving relationship with Jesus Christ of the Bible, I know from experience there is a big difference in what the Holy Bible teaches about Jesus and what the Mormon (LDS) Church teaches about Jesus. Millet is a sincere individual, but he has no authority to speak in behalf of LDS 'prophets,' contradicting what they have taught since the founding of Mormonism. The book overlooks statements by Mormon leaders who have emphasized that Mormonism is NOT Christian and that the Christ they teach and believe in is NOT the Christ of traditional Christianity.       For example, "We talk about Christianity, but it is a perfect pack of nonsense...It is a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol: it is as corrupt as hell; and the Devil could not invent a better engine to spread his work that the Christianity of the nineteenth century" (John Taylor, LDS prophet, Journal of Discourses, vol. 6, p. 167). Or even more recently, "In bearing testimony of Jesus Christ, President Hinckley spoke of those outside the Church who say Latter-day Saints `do not believe in the traditional Christ.' No, I don't. The traditional Christ of whom they speak is not the Christ of whom I speak. For the Christ of whom I speak has been revealed in this the Dispensation of the Fulness of Times" (Deseret News, Church News section, Salt Lake City, Utah, week ending June 20, 1998, p. 7).       If you are interested in warm-fuzzy, feel-good, ecumenical theology, you will probably enjoy this book. However, if you are interested in Truth and knowing the REAL Jesus Christ, the One Who can offer genuine salvation, flee from the false christ of Mormonism. Take everything the author says with a pound of salt and do your own research. You will see for yourself that the Mormon Jesus and the Christian Jesus are as different as night and day 
 I opened one packet (which was quite large for a serving, and shared it with 3 others in my office. We all took one spoonful and in unison said it was terrible. No one could continue eating it, and I sent back 8 of the 9 packets. Not edible, in our humble opinion.  Sorry 
 I bought LeapPad Plus Writing on impulse at the store, wanting to help my son with writing, phonics, etc.  He used it a few times, but I almost have to beg for him to use it...and that's sad. I wish I would have gotten the original LeapPad or perhaps even the Leapster.   For one thing, the book doesn't recognize all pencil movements. A child could make an incorrect number or letter, and it doesn't seem that the LeapPad would recognize it. Also, the child has to keep erasing over and over, providing limited usage.  Not only that, there are only a few books published with LeapPad Writing in mind, and the exercises are repetitive (e.g. writing the number 6 ten times).  I've bought quite a few LeapPad books and Quantum Pad books for my son, and he is just not interested after initial use. I'm sure he's learned a little bit of phonics using the phonics books and such, but I think he learns more from workbooks bought at a bookstore or a department store--and they're cheaper! Not only that LeapPad books are very short...much shorter than workbooks you can buy.  Considering that LeapPad books are usually around $15 a pop--and that Amazon doesn't carry/list them all and there is a VERY limited selection in Stuff Mart-type stores (at least, that's the case in my geographical area)--you may want to re-consider investing in the LeapPad system. 
 Turns out I purchased this cd for one song.  I was very disappointed with the rest of the cd.  The song At Last is wonderful but one song is not worth the price of the entire cd 
 After witnessing the onset death of his actress mother in a most implausible way (what movie crew would use a metal fence with their actors near electricity?), child of divorce, Jeff (Furlong), is off to live with his dad permanently and must accept the fact that his parents will never get back together. Or will they? Director Lambert makes the returned dead a bit more interesting this time by making them more intelligent and cunning. Unfortunately this was primarily used as a means to portray a lot of cheesy and cheap "shocks" and even unexplained motives for the Gus (Clancy Brown) character. Gone is the endearment and tragedy of the original; substituted with excessive gore f/x and spiteful characters. Furlong, who managed to impress in his early roles with characters who had similar family of origin problems (Terminator 2, American Heart, Brain Scan, A Home of Our Own), doesn't do much here outside of sullen glares, cuss and cry "Mom!" (literally) a number of times. Overall cheesy fun for horror fans but a flop in the character and scare departments. Hard to believe Mary Lambert, director of the first film, is responsible for this major dispointment of a sequel to the superior original. The ending suggests a setup for a sequel. I suppose we can all feel lucky this franchise remained buried after all 
 Very superficial.  Not nearly the depth of the authorized biography 
 The text is a decent introduction to the basics of Biblical criticism and is fairly readable for first-time students in the field. That said, the author is given to overstatement of his case, often failing to recognize that the theories he espouses also have had some criticisms by other scholars. This leaves open the very real possibility of biasing new students against other theories prevalent in the field without giving them an option of weighing the evidence for themselves. So it's good, only as long as you remember that what is reported in many cases is simply the opinion of the author. (As a rule, whenever somebody says "modern scholars say", look to the evidence they provide, not the blatant appeal to authority). 
 The absolute worst book eve 
 This book provides nothing new.  It is centered on the whole idea of setting up your retirement accounts so they automatically deduct from your paycheck.  If you have 401k, duh, it does that automatically...anyway, boring.  It also says to save money, don't use credit cards, pay yourself, blah, blah, blah.  Oh yeh, if you save early you will be a millionaire in like forty years...zzzz.   Ok, it did help me by reminding me about the interest rates in banks.  One idea was to put the emergency funds in a money market account which offers a higher interest rate than a regular savings account.  Upon reading this, I decided to do this and doing this made me realize the dismal .2% I've been earning on my saving account.  And not realizing the latest craze started by ING, all the other banks offer an "online savings" account which offers 5% compare to the dismal .2%.  I immediately switched!  Other than this part of the book, it was boring 
 This book seeks to look at American cultural patterns within a cross-cultural perspective. A number of cultural stereotypes are compared with the American stereotype, particularly Japan. I say "cultural stereotypes" because this is what is primarily used. At times, I have to disagree completely with the authors' interpretation of the meaning behind the actions of the cross-cultural experience. For example they give some examples of difficulties the author(s) had in Japan and then they explain why this occurred, always giving the benefit of the doubt to the Japanese culture. However, if that same action would be seen as an insult by a Japanese person I really see no reason for the authors to explain it away using a Japanese cultural value. In other words, they fail to critically analyse different cultures either from within or from an American perspective. The end result is that you are to assume that other cultures always treat people with respect and it is only an American-centric view that would think otherwise. I am not American and can claim something of a dispassionate view on the subject.  At first glance this book appears to be a useful, quick read for those going overseas but in reality it is a tough slog through some unanalysed stereotypes. This book fails to get past surface meanings to the deeper reality of the cross-cultures with which it contrasts American culture 
 I saw the NY Dolls at Mercer Art Center back in their first year. Frankly, they were amateurish at best; simply awful on a bad night. And time has changed nothing. This record is tedious bordering on unlistenable noise. What time HAS changed is the reverence and "importance" people have attached ot them. In reality they were and are at most a footnote on the glam and pre-punk scene. WIth other bands like the Miamis, they tried to be something that they simply wer enever competent or creative enough to be. So despite all the posturing and pontificating about their alleged importance, instead, I suggest you listen to anyone of the clips provided and see for yourself that this is a record not worth buying 
 Even though yugioh is dead, this is my favorite pack (even though i don;t get them any more). The deck that i made is an Archfiend deck, which can kill you if you don't have a spell card on the field that says you don't have to pay life points for Archfiend cards. They are also one of the strongest group if cards. There is TerrorKing Archfiend, InfernalQueen Archfiend, Archfiend Solder, and others. Even though yugioh is dead, some people still play ot, and some stores but them from you. I sold my deck for $$$, you should too.   
 An older book, recently republished, by the author of the Pippi Longstocking books, The Red Bird is the story of Matthew and Anna who have very sad days with a mean farmer in Myra until they find a door in a wall that leads to Sunnymead and happiness.   A modern young reader will not stay with this book long. Both its repetitive and lengthy text as well as its dully colored illustrations do not entice one to contine reading past the halfway point.  And although there is a happy ending, the reader is left feeling sorry for Matthew and Anna, not rejoicing at their freedom.  I do not know if Lindgren meant this to be so, but the story has the very strong feeling of being a metaphor for life on earth versus an after-life in heaven.   Unfortunately, not destined to be a classic.  
 I was scouting around for a new British crime series to start and heard good things about Peter Robinson. So, when I came across this second in the Inspector Banks series, it seemed like fate was telling me to dive in. However, I and my wife both found it a severely disappointing, utterly unimpressive procedural. I can only surmise the series gets better over subsequent volumes, because this is utterly average stuff.  Inspector Banks has recently relocated form London to sleepy rural Yorkshire and is still getting a feel for the lay of the land (following his first case in Gallows View). One day a retired historian turns up dead in a field near the village of Helmthorpe, leaving Banks with an old-fashioned whodunit. Pretty quickly, the stable of suspects is established: his widow (who inherits a nice legacy), his old friend and publisher, his mystery-writing drinking pal, his local GP and drinking pal, a local entrepreneur developer drinking pal, or the local folk singer he may have had a fling with a decade ago?   Like a latter-day Miss Marple, Banks and his plod underlings go back and forth from house to house, interviewing suspects and trying to tease a semblance of motive and opportunity from their statements. Of course, like the old-fashioned constructions of Christie, we are left with lots of semi-plausible motives and seemingly few opportunities. Banks is convinced the answer lies in a fateful summer ten years ago. Meanwhile, a local teenage girl brags about seeing something the night of the murder, placing herself in danger. Will Banks be able to get to the bottom of things before the killer strikes again?!?!?   It's all pretty bland stuff, and gimmick by which the murderer masks themselves is a bit of a groaner. The clues dovetail nicely, and Robinson's done a capable job of constructing a puzzler, but the story and characters are instantly forgettable. The writing is utterly without style or distinction and the Yorkshire setting never really came alive for me. It seemed a kind of generic green and pastoral land with insular people and cure stone cottages. All in all, very little to recommend here. 
 (What do Holly Hunter and Burt Reynolds have in common?)  Just another flick about a gal who falls for an abuser, this time with the gimicks of a waterlogged piano and exotic New Zealand Maori.   The tribe had it right, though, ignore these two losers and stick with the trees 
 from a very good writer. Absolutely a let-down -- nothing but a very brief untidy mish-mash of foreigners in Florence..My suggestion would be to pick up a copy of Mary McCarthy's stones of venice & florence -- it's a little outdated, but for an equally brief book is packed with fascinating information that will give you a real handle on this fantastic city.. 
 Sue Grafton has written many good books but this one is weak, weak, weak. Try 'A is for Alibi' or 'J is for Judgement'. They show off Grafton's writing talents much better 
 I was very unhappy with this product. First the shipping took way too long. Second, the tube is much smaller than sold at Macy's and the cost is more. And the contents were gross, very goopy. Not smooth. Like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. I'll fight the mall to buy this next time 
 Which ones the movie with the naked blond chick on the cover 
 How hard can it be , shipped a cell phone carrying case instead of a charger 
 For puzzle lovers, when we opened the puzzle the pieces were not glued correctly they were all uneven thicknesses.  Puzzle was cute, but not very sturd 
 Este album es menos que basura. Las letras de las canciones no tienen sentido y la música suena horrible. Estos pseudo raperos no tienen idea de lo que es verdadero rap. Son unos pobres diablos imitadores de Cypress Hill, que no tienen nada importante que decir. No pierdas tu tiempo, ni mucho menos tu dinero, en este album que no vale ni un centavo 
 Rarely have so many pages been used to convey so little information. This is a very superficial treatment of many subjects. This book offers very little in making language interesting.  I bought this book after reading a review in the New York Times which made it sound interesting. After looking through this book, I suspect the reviewer was put up to writing a favorable review. If you think this book might be interesting, borrow a copy and inspect it before buying. 
 I'm not a big fan of this novel; I feel like instead of using specific character experiences to mold its unique story, it really capitalizes upon the context of the story. Its setting, native american reservation post WW2, is certainly a fertile ground for all sorts of social commentaries.    However, the tone of the novel is set mostly by the main character's incessant depression and post traumatic stress; you can't blame a war veteran for being traumatized, but this tone makes everything slightly noticeable in the novel of great exaggerated importance because, hell, it could somehow refer to war or the suboridination of the native americans.   All of the action in this book occurs before you open the first page. We get glimpses of Tayo's life in the war, which would have probably made for a much more interesting, revealing, enlightening, and emotional book. I feel like this novel is very dry and not of much consequence.\  If you're not being forced to read this book through school, then don't waste your time.  After pages and pages of non-events occuring in the desert wasteland, you'll wonder what made you pick it up in the first place 
 Very basic techniques for the readers new to spiritual healing. Nothing new or that has not been said better by more advanced authors 
 Gene Florence has let true glass collectors down with this book. With so many etch patterns to identify, he chooses instead to cover more obscure things like Cathay Crystal. I did not solve one glass mystery with this book and wish I had saved my money. Also, again, he chose to completely ignore Maryland Glass. Although a fan, I cannot let this one slide. Save your money and don't bother with this one 
 Ok, well maybe I'm a cookbook snob, but I couldn't fathom some of these "recipes". Baked Brie?  I mean come on... who needs a recipe to put a wheel of Brie into the oven??  Or putting sausage in the oven with mustard slathered all over it, or rolling up some chicken and mustard in a lettuce leaf.  These are more IDEAS but RECIPES???  I will admit to loving Bon Appetit and Jacques and Julia, so you'll need to relate there to get me.  Plus, most of their recipes call for "teriyaki sauce"???  It's like my grandma making hundreds of recipe that call for Mrs. Dash.  What do they mean "teriyaki sauce"?  If they really mean that , it has sugar or corn syrup in it.  If not, is this meaning soy sauce?  If so, why is it in EVERYTHING???  I love low carb food, but this cookbook did not help me come to that love 
 I rate this negative five stars. I just purchased it, thinking, after reading all the reviews, that it was great. What a crock!!!! It's absolutely worthless. It DOES NOT clean the water. It's been plugged in for a whole day and the water is absolutely filthy. The water flows and the motor is running, the charcoal is in place but it doesn't clean the water. I'm better off with a bowl that I clean every day. This thing just swishes around dirty water. Don't waste your money 
 "Spark Notes A Man For All Seasons" was not condensed, but was merely the play reworded.  Granted that it did help decipher hidden meanings behind some of the dialogue, or certain innuendo's which can go over one's head, but other than that, it was not helpful or insightful.  I think it actually took me longer to read the Spark Notes, than the actual play itself.  If you do get this book, of course you know to read "Spark Notes A Man For All Seasons" AFTER you have read "A Man For All Seasons: A Play in Two Acts."  I do not recommend 
 Normally I'm first in line for a romance book and have been known to like even the cheesiest of books but this one is, unfortunately, only worth one star.  The plot, writing and characters seem like they were created by a middle schooler. I couldn't even get into the storyline because I was so distracted by the horrible writing!   Truth be told, I only read two or three pages before I threw the book away. Just a pure shame. 
 While Sigma Six Software development is an interesting book, very little of the book has anything to do with software development. Most of the commentary and examples in the book are about Manufacturing, not about Software development.  While the book does have value, it is mostly a decent overview of Sigma Six in general.  If it is your goal to learn about Sigma Six in general, there are literally hundreds of generalist Sigma Six books in the marketplace. Hopefully, someone, someday will write a good book on Sigma Six that focuses on software.  Unfortunately, the cover and title of this book does not reflect its contents 
 Being able to follow directions well is not good enough for this book.  This book was recommended to me by teachers, but it is useless and should not be used at all.  I don't like that the visuals are old, and it is worse if you are using a MAC because they are mainly for PCs.  The instructions are not straight foward - for instance I tried to upload my site images and half way through his instructions I was lost--I coulnd't find the windows he was referring to. I struggled for hours and finally, feeling defeated, I googled what I needed and found a web site that had more straight forward instructions. If I ever wanted to throw your computer or a book out the window, this was the time.  Also, he seems to abbreviate his instructions to emcompass all the how to's in short sentences, but it gets too abbreviated that there seems to be steps missing -- he does this through out the book and uses names of windows this way as well.   To my opinion this is definitely a waste of money and I regret buying it 
   Michael Moore filmed this propaganda,partially financed by the United Auto Workers, to distract attention from the real reason GM was forced to shutter plants - the Japanese auto invasion, made possible by  GM's unhealthy cost structure. The  company was burdened with exorbitant UAW wages, something union friendly Michael Moore does his best to conceal. So Roger Smith becomes the reason for the plant closings. Years of losses at GM have shown Moore's twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then - phoney  UAW sponsored lies to  shift attention away from the  primary role played by the UAW in the death spiral of the automakers. Moore and others pretend GM management had dropped the ball, but GM lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff, let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain. ALL of GM's problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the UAW albatross - slow redesign cycles, lack of money for research, you name it.  Moore will never mention how the UAW has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and  how now that consumers have a choice, they find the better value in Asian autos. Nobody wants to pay a UAW worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor. The UAW has fixed labor prices for long enough. Enough is enough and Moore  is shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a "documentary." 
 Its a low level polemic against social sciences. The author holds up evolution to explain modern human societys. Something between Wilson and "The bell curve" His knowledge about social sciences is not funded.. 
 I was disappointed with this book.  I knew it would have bits from the author's previous books plus new words of wisdom.  But each page only had one sentence of advice. I thought she'd write a little bit about each suggestion like in her previous books.  i'm glad I bought this book used.  Otherwise it was a waste of money for me. 
 I am a fan of novels curtailing the lives of the glamorous, but this was disappointing.  It had a promising start, but then just went nowhere and ended suddenly in a terrible mess.  Save your money; I wish that I could recover the six hours of my life that I wasted on this novel 
 This book is the first one you will reach for if it is your first pregnancy. Save your cash and get it from the library. Then read something that expects you to be a thinking woman, not a child taking orders or information without question. If you want to go through pregnancy, labor and birth, and have no say at all or learn anything useful, then stick with this book; i.e., go to the hospital, have an epidural, episiotomy, then finally the c-section that 'must' have been necessary, this is it.   Beyond that, read Ina May Gaskins, Henci Goer, the Sears' books, and "Childbirth Without Fear." Read a broader selection - many of which you can also get from a library or spend a night thumbing through at a bookstore.  I am a mother of 4; have had healthier, more positive birth experiences than anyone I know. This book is misleading and negative.  Make it the joyful event you deserve 
 I picked up this book hoping it would live up to its title, but what I found was that it was rather boring and lacking in character development. The ending seemed rushed and many of the issues raised were left unresolved. I was disappointed. 
 A story that fails to engage the reader and leaves Dan Lenson stranded in the desert, with no water in sight. Not up to the earlier efforts 
 I liked the second more but the first one sets up the background for the battle between good and evil.  The battle is in each of us as well as us against them.  I like the concept alot 
  I haven't seen a movie so one-sided since the Contender. They didn't even try to make good arguments for the pro-gun side. I hate to use the term Liberal Bias but in this case it fits like a glove. The cards in this movie were so stacked against the defense team that by the end of the movie I felt like the gun companies were the underdogs. Pure garbage.   
 In order for a cordless monitor to have any privacy, you need it to be digital and use digital-spread-spectrum (DSS) technology. 900 Mhz is the best frequency for a baby monitor, though. Here's why: It is important for people to know that if you have a wireless network in your house, that it cannot share the same frequencies at any other 2.4 Ghz devices. This includes baby monitors and cordless telephones. The correct arrangement should be: Baby Monitor: 900 Mhz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS) WiFi Netowrk: 2.4 Ghz Cordless Telephone: 5.8 Ghz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS 
 Despite its action-packed storyline with romance, violence, burglary, cross-culture scenary, it just didn't deliver. I got bored 3/4 of the movie and never bothered to finish it. "Cherry" actually annoyed me. I only got this movie because of I'm a fan of Leslie Cheung; he served as the main eyecandy. The american version of Entrapment with Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta Jones is so much better 
 This book is analagous to buying a new elliptical, anxiously opening the user manual to find out how this new piece of equipment is going to benefit you,  only to find page after page outlining the technical details of the inner workings of the machine with the last sentence or so briefly mentioning the effects the machine can have on your life. The author is obviously an expert on the subject of astronomy and how it relates to ancient historical monuments, but he is so caught up in the technical details that "the transformation of our consciousness" is brushed aside as an afterthought. Instead, the author drones on and on and on about monuments, angles, precessions, measurements etc. It's obviously necessary to briefly cover the technical aspects to build a foundation for the more exciting stuff to come, but this book never builds on that foundation. There were brief moments when I thought the book started to get really interesting, but the author would quickly revert back to the same old empirical, newtonian shallowness with more chapters that should have been titled, "who gives a [...]." John Major Jenkins is not really interested in the metaphysical side of this subject, and if you don't believe me, I quote page 239 of this book..."as a reminder, my work is not really to identify a mechanism that could empirically explain why a solstice-galaxy alignment might have transformative effects for life on Earth." My question is then why mention the transformation of consciousness in the title when it's hardly mentioned in the book? You would think that the benfits and effects of the sun aligning with the galactic center is going to have on our consciousness would be the main focus, since after all, it's what most of us should be most concerned with. If you are preparing for a test in astronomy, this book is for you. 2 stars for the misleading title. 
 It works if there's a direct line of sight to the reciever.  In other words, if the ipod is lying down horizontally, it won't respond.  You'll want to use a dock or something else to prop it up vertically for it to work 
 I read this book as part of a Contemporary World Literature course I took in college, and I thought it was the worst book I have ever read.  The book is supposed to be about a white woman in South Africa whose father is in prison because of his anti-apartheid views.  The strange thing is I learned NOTHING about South Africa, living conditions for whites and blacks in South Africa, and the effect that apartheid had on people in living in South Africa.  This book was written in a hoity-toity, avant garde, stream of conciousness fashion that it was impossible to know what was going on.  I found myself counting the number of pages until I finished the book.  The author of this book should seriously consider writing a book that is coherent, informs people, and broadens their horizon of knowledge, which this book certainly does NOT do 
 The number of absurd coincidences, cliffhangers, and deus ex machinas required to sustain the plot of this boy scout daydream would challenge anyone's ability to suspend disbelief.  I would rate it as slightly less credible than the Wizard of Oz.  This silliness spoiled it for me, though I might have loved it if I had run across it at the age of 12.  This book does not give any kind of reliable view of World War I.  It is a fairytale.  Also despite what other reviewers have said, I found the South African apartheid-style racism pervasive and offensive.  This kind of thought was no more acceptable in 1916 than it is today, as Gandhi made so eloquently clear at the time 
 I really expected more of this product when reading the description.  Within 15 minutes of use, the antennae fell off of one.  Upon examining it, I discovered that it was for decorative purposes only and had no useful purpose.  We also had a hard time getting it to function properly.   My granddaughter, who loves stuff like this, rarely plays with it.  She wanted a REAL walkie-talkie and this one performs like a "pretend" one.  
 Along with the nanny, the stepdad, the cable guy, the 14-year-old girl with a crush... we now have the PHOTO PROCESSING CLERK to fear! Yes, everyone is out to get us.. or at least that's what Hollywood would have us believe.  I am getting sick of films like this that constantly contort  normal healthy human interaction and community relations into perverse horrors that are far from reality. No wonder we live in a culture of such exagerrated suspicion, mistrust, fear (and the resulting isolation) when we have films like this constantly stoking these fears of people around us.      Yes, films like these have their place. However, I think Hollywood has taken it a bit too far and needs to pull itself back into reality.    
   The advertisement for this item says that it can be used on cats, having a daughter who may or may not have difficulty with dander I was under the impression that this was the answer to those problems.  The description is a "massaging brush" but when one turns it on it sounds almost like a small vacuum cleaner.  As you are able to guess, cats scramble from it like a real vacuum cleaner!  On pure accident, it was knocked onto the ground, about two feet to the floor, and ceased working, so the sound was no longer a problem.  The brush surface disloded as well and I have yet to get it back in place. 
 It does not surprize me that this book has dropped over 200% in retail price. It wouldn't even get a passing grade in a beginning creative writing class - it's that poorly written. The fact that it's being promoted as "non-fiction" is an insult to the intelligence of consumers. I can only hope that we've seen the last of James Frey. 
 When you have lost weight, it's a very natural thing for others to be curious about how you lost your weight and kept it off. Whenever they have heard me tell my story, read my blog or book, or found out that I did it on the low-carb lifestyle, one question invariably has come up from time to time:   "What do you think about this low-carb diet where you can eat whatever you want for one-hour per day?"  My initial reaction to these people was usually something along the lines of this:  "That's absolutely crazy! There's no way you could ever lose weight and keep it off using this method."  I did the Atkins diet and honestly have not stayed on top of all the bazillion other low-carb diets out there. But there was something very odd about this plan that it made me look around to find out more about it.  Little did I know there was an actual book out there about this very diet so many people had been telling me about. It's called The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet and it was written by a husband/wife team Drs. Richard and Rachael Heller.  The CAD diet, as it is referred to, makes the claim (and I agree with it) that many people are addicted to carbohydrates and need to be weaned off from depending on them for sustenance. Just like a drug addict gets small concentrated doses of their preferred drug daily so they can eventually get by with less and less, that same concept is what goes into the CAD diet.  If people think the Atkins diet is restrictive, then check out what you have to do on the CAD diet:  BREAKFAST: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat. LUNCH: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat.  You are NOT allowed to eat any bread, fruit, milk, juice, and most starchy vegetables. Absolutely NO snacking whatsoever except for black coffee or diet soda. You cannot use artificial sweeteners either.  Sound appealing, anyone? Hmmm? I suppose if that's all there was to this diet, then NOBODY would do it. But there is one more key aspect of the CAD diet that you probably will be interested in.   DINNER: Eat equal amounts of protein, vegetables and dessert of whatever you want to eat in whatever amount, but it must be eaten in a one-hour time frame. You can even enjoy a beer or glass of wine with your "reward" meal.  How's that for incentive? You basically starve all day long just so you can get to those sixty minutes at the end of your day where you can say hello to the buffet line! Who wouldn't enjoy a diet that lets you do THAT?!  Well, I'm still very skeptical about any lifestyle change that encourages you to eat the very foods that got you overweight or obese to begin with on a DAILY basis. I caught a lot of flack from my fellow low-carbers about my controversial "planned splurge" meal every 6-8 weeks during my weight loss. However, the Hellers give you a DAILY planned splurge!!! What's up with that?  We can blame this on Dr. Rachael, who stumbled upon this way of eating when she weighed 268 pounds after being on diet after diet. She became a psychologist to learn more about why people overeat (ostensibly to help herself in the process, too). She had skipped breakfast and lunch on a particular day she was fasting for a blood test and then, like most of us would, ate to her heart's content whatever she wanted for supper. The next morning she noticed she had dropped 2 pounds.  Thinking something must have gone wrong with her scale, she tried it again the next day, skipping breakfast and lunch and then eating a gargantuan dinner and once again, she lost another pound. She played around with what would eventually become The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet and went on to lose 150 pounds which she has kept off to this day.  The frequency of eating carbohydrates is the key behind the CAD diet. The Hellers believe that anyone who consumes ANY amount of carbohydrates during the day will set off all the bells and whistles in your body that you are hungry faster than if you avoided them altogether. They say that eating carbs throughout the day is like giving lots of small doses of cocaine to a cocaine addict. It will make them crave their poison even more!  That's why you basically avoid eating carbs on the CAD diet until the end of the day. This process of getting over carbohydrate addiction is a tricky one, and the Hellers think they have found a solid plan for making it work for lasting weight loss in people.  I still can't get around the fact that you don't change the poor eating habits of the people who have packed on the pounds. Sure, they basically starve themselves throughout the day before they eat their one BIG meal each day, but how is that stimulating the metabolism and preventing the biggest obstacle to weight loss success -- HUNGER!  There's no way I could do the CAD diet because I enjoy eating every 2-3 hours to keep my digestive process constantly in motion. I truly believe this is one of the things that has helped me lose the weight and keep it off. Since you cannot snack or use artificial sweeteners on the CAD diet, it would literally drive me insane even if there was that "reward" meal at the end of the day!  Wanna take a test to see if you are a carb addict? Click here to take the 10-question Carbohydrate Addict's Test. I scored a 2, which means "You do not appear to be carbohydrate addicted." No kidding, ya think?  Dr. Jonny Bowden, author of Living The Low-Carb Life, examined the CAD diet and said the diet uses some fuzzy science to make their points about why their plan works.  "While it seems pretty clear that there are both insulin and serotonin abnormalities in the obese, it's not at all clear that high levels of insulin depress levels of serotonin, as the Hellers hypothesize--in fact, the majority of the evidence points to the opposite response."  Furthermore, Dr. Bowden said he is concerned about the lack of attention on exercise as part of their weight loss program, stating "it's vital to both maintaining weight and to raising the metabolic rate."  While The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet has worked for a lot of people and I always tell people to do what works for them to lose weight and keep it off, I still have my reservations about this program. I think I'll pass on carb-loading my body for one hour a day 
 Dave Barry's novel is a quick read, but there's nothing fresh about the story or the characters.  The story centers on many different characters that become involved in a potential airport disaster--a columnist, his son, a rich, sleazy lawyer, a wannabe criminal, etc.  Like Elmore Leonard's books, the characters begin to collide in unpredictable ways.  But the pay-off is just not that great.  You may find yourself thinking "What's the point?" after finishing the novel.  This book was made into a pretty forgettable movie that featured a great cast (Tim Allen, Rene Russo, Stanley Tucci, Tom Sizemore, etc.) 
 After reading this book i asked myself if it's chi kung book or a zhan zhuang(Yiquan) book. I don't know chi kung but i know, a little, ZZ practice and about me the author'd like to speak about yiquan. But at last he fails. Good picture and a good writing explain us a lot 'yiquan' or 'xingy' postures but Mr Kam Chuen Lam forgets the mental training. Saying "be relax" or "thinking to wonderfull garden for relaxing" is not useful to yiquan mental training. The author concludes the book with the illustration of 5 elementes arranged 5 type of punch: the explantation's not always clear. Perhaps Kam Lam Chuen videotape could be clearer. Eh?           
 I highly recommend buying this type of booster pack. Nearly every card rocks, even the commons are awesome. If you want to work on a Light-type deck, or just a normal one, you'll lose every time without these. Also, what's everyone's problem? Not long ago, YGO was the most popular thing out there, and now I'm lucky to still be popular because I still like it.  P.S. Buy the Exclusive Pack 
 There are numerous unforgiveable errors (miscaptioned horror stars etc.), irrelevant entries, and general bad writing and research. There is a link between serial murder and the werewolf myth, but Steiger's either unaware of it, or doesn't trouble himself to investigate it in his copious pointless coverage of sundry random serial killers. The real tragedy is that given the space in terms of generous pagination, and budget evinced in the prolific illustration, there was the space here for something definitive. Instead, this is a mess. This needs more than exposure to the full moon to transform into a good book 
 Having been born in the mid-'80's, I unfortunately did not yet exist to experience the late '70's punk movement or was too young to be part of the '80's hardcore years. Instead, I got to grow up with the MTV generation.... how so very lucky I am. Yet, I figured out the difference between real music and the junk mainstream media keeps referring to as "punk". So, if I could figure it out, any other idiot from this forsaken generation shouldn't have any problems. Good Charlotte is okay if you're 8 years old, but if you're 13 and you're still listening them you need to just grow up and listen to much better stuff. If you're my age and you listen to Good Charlotte then you are beyond any help.  Instead of Good Charlotte, buy or steal the real thing: Subhumans:Time Flies + Rats. It was the first one I picked up and it led to an entire collection of real, gritty, raw punk music. Bottom line: go from whining about how much your life sucks to actually doing something about it. 
 I have an Amazon bookmark that advertises Ludlum's book "The Sigma Protocol". It says "In Ludlum's latest, an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy." Well gee. That's the plot of THIS book as well. Come to think of it, that's the plot of every book by the man that I've read. A 'vast right wing conspiracy' is set to take over the world. They have small armies, a lot of money and a plan. This time around, a group of military men (naturally) plan to foment terror, and use the chaos to implement their vision of the world (laugh not - millions in the Middle East and far Left believe 9-11 was something along the same lines). Enter "ordinary man" Joel Converse. He's a Vietnam vet and P.O,W. who thought he had left that life far behind. It's up to him to save the world. He will survive certain death several times (the bad guys always seem to think they need him alive, and they just HAVE to explain their conspiracy to this total stranger). He will find love, and he'll visit several European cities to boot. Of course, a suspension of disbelief is essential for many novels (how else would you believe that a Nazi and an Israeli are on the same side?), but Ludlum's cliched stories are further worsened by the fact that he just couldn't write. His dialogue writing is always tedious, and sometimes just painful to read. Action scenes are generic. The only thing he could do right is character background, but that's not enough to save this. "The Aquitaine Progression" might make a half decent TV movie, but to endure 700 pages is just too much 
 I love trying out new products for my hair and also happen to have slightly thinning hair on the top of my head (with receding corners).  After seeing this set at Sephora I tried it for a week and found the results mediocre.   My hair, which is thin and not very abundant, did feel slightly thicker and had a plump look at the roots (especially the crown) but I am sensitive to smell and didn't like the man's cologne like scent.  The shampoo lathers up nicely but the conditioner is dense and doesn't spread well over the hair.  The mouse is interesting.  It definitely seems to make a difference in volume.  The overnight liquid makes hair a bit messy to sleep in.    As is the case with any product, it may work for you but it didn't for me.  I believe in changing the body/hair from the inside out works better than rubbing niacin (vitamin b) topically to the scalp and hair.  I would recommend you try it.  You can always return it if you're not satisfied 
 I have to preface this review by saying that I normally do not have a visceral reaction to novels and stories I do not like.  As a matter of fact, I have wasted a good chunk of my life reading things that were no good and or not worth reading.  That being said, I actually threw this book across the room.  I have never read such a self-congratulatory piece in all my life.  The smug conceit of the author actually oozes out of every page.  The book made me go and reread some Dostoevsky, just so I could feel better about the world and literature 
 Sorry, I just cannot believe that the "humorous" and "honest" approaches recommended in this book will work. It all seems very idealistic, flaky and undignified. I value honesty (and humor too!) but there is also something to be said for modesty and decorum. I would find someone using these strategies very off-putting -- the words "sense of entitlement" come to mind. And I am not conservative. So what would a conservative employer think 
 I like the sound. I trashed the CD because of the lyrics... did not like the implications and found it to be a little too disturbing 
 Advertisement for this book is misleading. I thought it was the actual book, however its merely a workbook full of vocabulary. Not helpful at all!!! Save your money, you will still need the real book anyway! 
 I figure to be the lone voice of dissent with this novel, which I found confusing and ultimately uninteresting.  Genet's novel, written while in prison, jumps back and forth among the many characters, often following tangent upon tangent.  I kept losing track of who was who, which one is supposed to be Genet (because I had the distinct impression that this novel might be autobiographical), sorting out the names and sequences of events, and trying to find a storyline that would last long enough to hold my interest.  Genet would start on a good story and then all of a sudden jump in another reflection from that, never satisfactorily returning or finishing the original story.  It's very sexual and delves into the world of transvestism, but ultimately left me more confused than ever about what Genet was trying to say.  
 Humour does date badly.  One of the jokes refers to a new building made in MCMLXXXIV...  1984 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software.  The vid is encrypted so that you need Amazon's player to view it.  Blah.  You're better off buying the DVD for $20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the DVD somewhere other than your own computer.  
 While I found another of this series clear, informative, and entertaining, entitling this work Introducing Semiotics is a misnomer.  This work does not serve well for someone hoping to gain an introduction to semiotics which will provide a basic framework to build on.  Though the author does introduce us to key figures in the development of semiotics and gives the reader some idea of the relationships between them - a useful list for further study - the main theme is not coherently presented.  The book reads much more like a very loosely ordered collection of snippets from lecture notes or casual discourses between semioticians planning on writing a book.  Topics are interleaved and skipped between in at best a partially constructive manner.  Often ideas are introduced in a way that seems like we're joining their discussion midway through.  The level of technical jargon is high and the writing style showcase's the author's extensive vocabulary without an equal capacity to bring the terms and ideas into a simpler, working summary with straightforward examples. And many of the examples that are included tend to obscure than clarify the topic.  The illustrations are interesting and give the page layout a welcoming feeling which the text unfortunately does not support.  I would look for another book if you want a useful introduction to semiotics 
 Most of this book seems to focus on the "adult" video industry, with a hefty portion of wife swapping thrown in.  The former is pretty much a LA industry, and the latter is more of a realm for perverted hobbyists than part of the Las Vegas sex business.  The book cruises along for quite a while before getting to the meat and potatoes of prostitution and "gentlemen's clubs" in Vegas.  Those parts of the book at least have some interest, but the author wastes too much paper, ink and readers' time on the personal history of each and every stripper, hooker, and wannabe that he interviews.  It seems that there is much to be written about the BUSINESS of sex in Vegas, and even more about how that business is carried out, and by whom.  Sadly, this is not the book for that 
 Tao Teh Ching is a monumental work.  Unlike other religious texts, the Tao Teh Ching is barely 5000 letters spread over 81 single-page poetic passages.  You can probably read thru it in a couple hours or less.  But for the serious reader, it can take a lifetime of study and contemplation.  In ancient times, scholars in China and Korea really did spend a lifetime on this one text, not only sudying, but transcribing it, discussing it, and abiding by its tenets in their daily lives.  I've myself pored over it many times in Chinese, Korean and now English, and every time I read it I cannot but be amazed by the wisdom of Lao Tse (or, as some allege, the group of people who contributed to this text).  The problem with English, or I suppose any language not associated with Chinese, is that it is almost impossible to translate Tao Teh Ching with sufficient coherency.  Chinese words are each and all very efficient, in that virtually every single "letter" is replete with meaning.  Therefore, whereas the Chinese may use 10 words to describe something, English might require 10 times that words to adequately translate the meaning.  For example, in the second passage, third stanza, the translated text says, "therefore, the Sage manages his affairs without Ado."  What does "without Ado" mean?  In chinese this is stated in two letters as "Mu Wi" - non-action.  It does not mean to sit back and not participate or instigate any activity.  Rather, "Mu Wi" means doing things in a very natural, spontaneous way that is not forced, does not create conflict and has no secular motives.  As there are no secular motives behind the action, it is as if the Sage does not "act" in the way other poeple act.  His actions are like breathing, and almsot imperceptible; thus it is as if he does not act.  Concepts like "Mu Wi" and "Mu Ji" - non-knowledge - abound in Tao Teh Ching.  These cannot simply be translated away with a couple english words.  In short, a Tao Teh Ching ranslation requires pages and pages of footnotes to accurately reflect the rich meaning behind every passage.  Moreover, many passages can be read in more than one way.  In fact, different translations sometimes say radically different things about the same passage precisely because of this ambiguity.  Any serious translation of Tao Teh Ching should point these out.  Tao Teh Ching is very concise, and written in a poetic style.  But unless you are versed in ancient Chinese language and tomes, you should really consult the literally thousands of guides that scholars wrote over the years to help you read thru the text.  Tao Teh Ching is not some kind of Buddhist sutra that you can just recite over and over without knowing what it means.  It is deeply profound and rich with hidden subtexts.  In China and Korea many of these guides - some of them more than a thousand years old - still survive.  I've yet to find an enligsh guide.  But I am sure they exist.  PLease find them; refrain from reading the translation by itself, for most times all you will see are a jumble of meaningless words 
 I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read.  
 The author of this book describes it as "Lots of fun" but forgot to continue the phrase and include "for the demented" because personally for me this book was no fun at all. I mean compared to some of her other books this book is really bad. I liked Catherine Coulter and i like most of her books but this one...well i regret having wasted money on this one. so boring i didnt even finish it! The main trouble with this book is the dialogue..long and silly. the characters are realy not likeable at all -jack and Grey. Grey's reaction to JAck's stealing his horse was way too exagerated and hard to believe. I would have liked to finish this book but, frankly after threee attempts i gave up because its so boring and childish. Yes childish and if you read if for yourself you will surely agreee. The author clearly tries to be humourous...but, in my opinion does not succeed in doing so. A book is not made humourous just by putting stupid dialogue and a silly storyline. I made a mistake because i chose to ignore the other reviews which were posted here and bought it anyway : 
 I bought this book for my Numerical Analysis class.  It proves theorems very un-rigorously.  I've only seen the first 3 chapters so far, but a frequent phrase that comes up is "and by the results that we will show in Chapter 6, (statement) is true" 
 First of all, pot doesn't make you aggressive. It's absurd to think that a person would spill the beans about their sexual fantasy in such a mean way after taking a few puffs from a joint. The argument after the pot smoking seemed too contrived, just like all of the dialog and action in the movie. Things only seem to happen to lead you into the next scene. It's ludicrous to think that a man is going to go off in search of a prostitute because his wife THOUGHT about having an affair.   Certain things seemed to be thrown in for shock value--Nicole Kidman on the toilet wiping herself, the nude, large-breasted patient that Tom Cruise was examining (what exactly was his specialty anyway?), and the father pimping his young daughter. Other things were thrown in for no reason at all: The patient whose father died and pathetically professed her love for the doctor. The prostitute, Domino, being diagnosed as HIV positive.  Another annoyance: Cruise's character always walked around saying "I'm a doctor", like that means something in NYC in the 21st century. (Sure, I'll let you into my store after midnight!)  The movie took us on a journey and then left us hanging. Too many questions were left unanswered: How did they know the doctor didn't belong at the party if everyone was wearing a mask and why was he such a threat since no one at the party could be identified? How did Nicole Kidman have a dream about an orgy the same night as the real one? How did the mask end up in the bed? Was there really foul play involved in death of the junkie prostitute and the quick exit of the piano player? What the hell was the point of this movie?   P.S. London only looks like New York City if you don't live in New York City 
 At least, that seems to be the consensus among the people I know who really enjoy the paranormals. I'm surprised Roc billed  it as a fantasy.  To me, "Claimed by Shadow" does not stand up to Chance's first novel.   Success is hard to follow.  The singer Joni Mitchell once said, "No one ever told Van Gogh to paint Starry Night again," but that's not necessarily true.  When an audience comes to expect a certain style from an artist, they're disappointed when the creator doesn't deliver.    In that vein of thought, a second novel should be very much like the first.  Wooddavis' review stating that the novels are running in place is spot on thematically.  Both novels have the same plotline with some variation.   The problem is, in my opinion, the second novel was not quite up to the standard of the first.  Most writing instructors and editors will advise newbie writers not to use flash-forwards and flash-backs at the beginnings of their careers.  While these devices are very useful and evocative, they can often lose the reader.  While Cassie's time-shift capability was an interesting new development, Chance did not handle these episodes with the same finesse that author C. E. Murphy uses in her Walker Papers series when Joanne goes vision-questing.  The time-shifting skill is definitely an interesting talent in conjunction with clairovoyance.  Aside from the paradoxes Cassie can create, she can also effect her own predictions--nulling and creating new ones as need arises.  I'm not sure Chance has sufficiently prepared her girl with the strength and decisiveness to be that dangerous an opponent.   Cassie also seems more indecisive in this story.  She's definitely entitled to these emotions, but that indecisiveness doesn't make her as likable as the stronger butt kicking heroines we're used to in fantasy.  Also, the episodes of 'what do I do' tend to derail the forward motion of the plot and stall the reader out.  These are spots where I as a reader get frustrated and tend to want to just skip.  While I read the entirely  of "Chained" I'm pretty certain I will skip the third book.       
 There is no doubt that both of them are well-educated gentlemen. This destory the whole purpose of the book - they are too polite to have any confrontation. Throughout the whole book, they are just presenting each other their own views. They actually haven't met each other to have a discussion and in fact, the title of the book misled me. It should be called "Belief or Non-Belief: Some Correspondences 
 Good points of the EL-300: Powerful sharp beam; LONG run per battery change; easy on-off quick-mount clamp for anti-theft; and, it's a superb FLASHLIGHT. I like to use it for undersink and underhood repairs, so I often borrow it from my bike. This light is intense enough to force a person to avert eyes, if the beam hits direct from even, say 40 away. Cateye does caution us not to play the beam on people's eyes. In my estimate, it is mostly a terrific flashlight, and not a great bike-mounted headlight, at least as a stand-alone.  Trouble is, that sharp-focused narrow beam makes you choose between two conflicting and shifting essentials: lighting your path (you actually CAN with this focused power); or alerting others to your presence. That would mean focusing it more toward oncoming traffic, or a tad right or left, toward peripheral traffic, depending where you are, and how the road tracks, and where cars are coming from. It's a real attention-getter to oncoming drivers, which is great, if conditions are all just right: IF you focus the lamp near level, and if the drivers are considerate enough to all approach from in front of your beam.   However, traffic off to the side is another deal, since the headlight's peripheral light suffers by contrast. I nearly took a short trip to a long rest, as a result. Late on a quiet night, one flaky guy entering a major, broad secondary road I was traveling was coming fast up to his stop-sign, on a side street to my right, ahead of where I had just rounded a curve. He had a view accross broad lawns, on up the dark road behind me.  After slowing just a bit, he accelerated and ran his stop sign. I was right near his position on his side-street, "committed," pedaling about 15 - 17 MPH, about to cross his bow. He started his right turn, gunning it, merging with unseen ME. He was totally UNAWARE OF ME, and was clearly of this mindset:           "No double-CAR-headlights,           no CAR noise,           so no CAR,            so nuttin' coming,            so, good-to-go, so -- GUN IT!" ... all in the space of a couple seconds.  Moving fast, with the right-of-way, I had the EL-300 blazing away bright. Only, it was focused straight ahead of me, and a tad downward toward the road surface yards in front. I was dependent on the EL-300, to send ahead to the likes of him, unavoidable announcing LIGHT. It's what I paid for (about $45.00 delivered). I also wore a white helmet, had reflective stripes on my panniers and rack trunk, and the churning reflectors on wheels and pedals. But I know darn well all the reflectors in the world have no merit, when not bathed by headlights, and if not also bouncing back at a narrow angle to the driver's eyes. That's why I own a headlight. It's why now-enlightened NJ demands a bike headlight.  Of course, neither does a DRIVER have any merit, when s/he rewrites the stopsign law to read "No need to stop as long as I don't SEE ANYONE COMING." He nearly killed me, coming fast at me, broadside. He had regained nearly 15 or more mph as he started his right turn, still accelerating, when he spotted me and panic-braked. We were at one point about 2 feet apart, thanks to his hard braking, and my veering left on the (luckily deserted) dark main road.   I was, for a fraction of a second, looking DOWN at his headlights and bumper almost below me. Could have reached over and touched his hood ornament. Incredible experience. It was my closest call ever, and scared the hell out of me. It must've scared the hell out of him, too. He registered his shock-and-awe with a reproaching after-fact horn blast, as he scrambled around and passed me, racing off before I could read his plate.  I guess it must've ticked him off, my scaring HIM with that close call. One little vehicular manslaughter can change your address awhile. Equally maddening for him, after he passed the intruding cyclist with the red blinkie taillight, and the white helmet, and all the reflectors (THOSE alerted him, once I was his front-and-center target), he would had to then see that blazing headlight's pencil-beam in his rear-view mirror. Damn, nuttin' he could blame on this creep on the bike. :-[  The EL-300 simply failed me that time, as I see it, by focusing most of its light in a narrow, long-projecting beam. It was focused left of where he was looking, when I was very close to the side street he was traveling, ignoring his stop-sign. There should, from so much light energy, be some part diverted wider, closer to the bike, even if lower intensity.  In my judgement there are two related design flaws with this lamp: 1. The narrow focused beam, making you "live(??) with" the single direction in which you aim the beam. Its relatively dim peripheral light gets lost in any ambient light.  2. That is in turn aggravated by its wandering from the aiming you settle on, both vertically and horizontally. The vertical part is the worse; the mounting clamp sets too far back from the headlight's balance-point, so it's a seesaw that's forward-heavy. Lift your bike front, tap it down lightly, and you've likely refocused the lamp lower, as you would not if the mounting were at the balance-point. Aim it temporarily right (and tight), and you are seemingly good to go ... but only as far as the first noticeable bump. It then drops a few degrees, and you keep correcting it vertically, to light EITHER your intended path, or the oncoming drivers' windshields. Your need is like being at the Oscars: you want to both see, and BE SEEN, only in this case to save your life.  I am chasing after another LED lamp now, which I understand to have a wider (along with brighter) beam. I have respect for Cateye in general. Their current website page of battery-op headlamps does not offer the EL-300. 
 I've read excerpts from this book before, specifically the excellent Judith Butler essay.  However the edition of the book I purchased printed pages 75-106 in place of pages 27-58, while printing the same pages in sequence as well.  
 Have still not been able to program this the way it should be, confusing controls instrucitons, complicated, not at all like my old scanner, cannot find a way to check to see what frequencies are stored in the scanner, would look for a diferent scanner that is more user friendly 
 This book assumes that you know about makeup and is basically a self promoting book about the celebrities the author knows. The first 40 or so pages do discuss makeup tips, but it's overshadowed by the remaining 100+ pages of stories of his famous clientele. Not what I was looking for in a beauty book 
 Woman-hating man writes novel about man-hating woman 
 I ordered the unit twice, and twice I received a Carrying Case. not the adapter.  I returned both and ordered direct from Cobra.   When I had called customer support for Amazon the second time, I got connected to India of course and was informed that a lot of their codes are wrong.  I guess they are trained to agree with anything the customer says. 
 This was a total waste of money.  The "Aloha" set was great, but this one was a major disappointment.  One entire DVD was nothing but re-takes and out-takes, the same thing over and over.  It could have all been scaled down on one DVD and been much more interesting.  We are big Elvis fans, just went to Graceland on our anniversary.  Elvis was a great entertainer and this is an insult to his fans for paying so much money to be bored!  Elvis was never boring!!!  This was marketed to get you to buy it, DON'T!  Save your money 
 Just finished reading the book, had never read Virginia Woolf before and had anticipated it eagerly, but was disappointed overall.  I think you have to have a poetic nature to appreciate it  and I've always had a hard time deciphering most poetry (sad to say).  Nothing really remains in my memory of the book except the suicide of Septimus.  I have read reviews that stretch back decades and understand that I am missing something monumental in writing, but for the life of me I was bored through most of it.  I have even bought a biography thru Amazon of her life to try and maybe appreciate the book and her writing more, but, in the words of another reviewer listed on amazon, she is just not my "cup of tea".  But, again, I recognize that she was a very innovative writer and will try another of her books, maybe I'll understand another better than this one. I'm not a pulp fiction/romance novel/trash reader at all, am very well read in fact, so I'm disappointed in myself for not getting what she was getting at.  Still, I encourage everyone to read the book, if for no other reason than to congragulate yourself on getting through it 
 I found this magazine to be helpful for an introduction to advanced computing.  That's about it.  This mag seems to be biased towards certain products & manufacturers.  They neglected to open my eyes wider.  The reviews/articles that are published seem to favor big money companies (microsoft, dell, etc). They don't give credit to smaller, better, less-well-known companies and technologies.  All the info is pretty basic for intro users, but if that's what you are interested in... then this is a great non-comlicated publication 
 I really had to work hard to finish this book.  It was a stuggle in the beginning to keep up with the characters and the plot, though by about 3/4 of the way through, it finally started to make sense.  It wasn't my favorite Ludlum book 
 I give him props for traveling the 'native way' and not in embassy SUVs with the free pass green plates, but that's about it.    He did not bother to figure out the differences between cultures, climates, or anything, he just took mental snapshots and wrote them down, usually with misplaced and uninformed incredulity.  The final straw for me was when he wrote about his visit to the Aswann damn and wrote about the dust on the photocopier, which he implied was due to lack of use.  I've lived in the Sahel, just south of the Sahara, and I swept INCHES of dust from my house DAILY.  That's what happens in parts of the world where there are dust and sand storms, and buildings aren't the sealed off stagnant cubes that they are in the west.  It simply happens to be like that there, neither good nor bad.  Maybe they hadn't used the copier, maybe they had.  He obviously made his decisions long before bothering to travel to the places he wrote about.  This book is insulting to the people it talks about and insulting to the people who read it. If you think critically, avoid it, you'll throw up your arms in disgust.  If, however, you like snap judgements from uninformed, pretentious 'the sky is falling' types, you'll love this book. 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book.  I was truly looking for a geography book for idiots.  What I was hoping for was a book that I could go to a map of any country and see important cities, rivers, mountains and other pertinent facts.  This is not that book.  The Index is HORRIBLE!  I do crossword puzzles and they often have clues for relatively unknown countries.  You cannot find them is this book.  The index does not list all of the countries, and if they are listed the maps are terrible.  The maps are very small and use real fine print.  I have 20/20 vision and absolutely cannot read the names of cities on these maps.  I cannot say enough bad about this book.  This IS NOT a book for geographical idiots 
 I found myself going through this book at an increasingly rapid pace. As with everything Bill Harris says there is a very, very low, signal to noise ratio.  The information in this book could be delivered in a well-written paragraph about what binaural beats do. I'm not be the person to write that paragaph but here's an attempt- Our brains are operating at 4 levels of frequency at varying degrees. Meditation can help focus you into one level but it is a long and painful process vs. listening to the CD, which can work without requiring mental attention. This meditative state helps you get recognized and change the bad mental patterns which you developed in childhood to protect yourself. 
 This movie is basically about 12 yr. old boys crying with each other.  When does that ever happen?  The dialogue is completely unbelievable considering the age of these kids.  What 12 yr. old worries about "..never getting out of this small town."?   I guess if your childhood consisted of sitting around and crying with your friends, then you might enjoy this movie in some lame nostalgic sense.  I have a feeling Oprah would like this movie.  
 This is an excellent example of a critic making a name for himself by "reading into" & interpreting (misinterpreting) other hugely respected authors according to one's own projected ideology. Since not one of the three famous & brilliant mythologists studied would agree with Ellwood's assessment of him, why should we assume his oh-so-sensitive political perspective & believe he & his particular judgmental frameworks have more insight into the workings of their minds than they do themselves? We shouldn't. Each of them would be aghast at this so much smaller intellect misreading him for its own ends. I implore you: If you wish to understand Jung, Eliade, or Campbell, read Jung, Eliade, or Campbell themselves. The three together complement each other nicely. If you must read Ellwood, be fair & read some of the great ones he "demythifies" for us *before* you venture into his abuse of them 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be. They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body. Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first. A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects. Some don't make it out the other side. I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone. Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones. I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too. Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 I was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004.  I was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie, but it was really lackluster.    The acting is wooden, the script is very lame, and worst of all, the action isn't very exciting.  I expected a much better movie from director Richard Donner.  There is a battle scene, and there are action scenes, but they just aren't exciting.  When the action isn't exciting, you better have a good story.  The story here is alright, but certainly not enough to save the movie.  I don't hate any of the actors, they are decent when they have something to work with.  Here they had nothing to work with, so they obviously didn't do too well this time.  This really isn't worth your time.  I gave this to the thrift shop after I got it, and I feel sorry for the person who bought it there 
 This book is chock full of hatred and inaccuracies. I was forced to read this book for a class and was disgusted from page one. How a teacher can assign this horror for a diversity class is beyond me. If you want indoctrination, then by all means read this nonsense. 
 this item arrived with a broken tank, and 1 week later quit making mist at al 
 Kepler is a well written historical novel written during a time when Banville was attempting to write what he considered 'European novels of ideas'. In writing about the mind of a great scientist, has found a way to write about creativity without going down the established, oft cliched route of writing about writing, or painting. However it is fundamentally a poor book, which Banville has subsequently admitted. It artfully chronicles the ideas of Kepler, his struggle, but fails to invoke this in a passionate or beautiful manner.   Banville's best novels are works of art. As Beckett said of Joyce, his work is not about anything, it is about the work itself. Kepler is a novel about something, a novel of ideas. It does not work well. 
 can someone please tell me why this guy is so well-respected? i got this one cheap because i knew he was always associated with great drummers, and jeez, with a title like this, how could i go wrong? but it's complete dreck. this guy had one keyboard and it wasn't a good one...and he used the worst sounds. over. and over. and over. he should be condemned to writing the "demo" tracks on entry level electronic keyboards for the rest of his life. i remember mine had "i love you just the way you are" on it, and it was better than every song on this album put together. of course, and here's a caveat: it may just be that i really hate fusion altogether.  
 This movie was terrible doesn't begin to explain it.  It's a vampire movie that follows none of the rules.  They don't have to be asked to let in.  No attacking them with silver or stake through the heart.  Just shoot em up.  Also the plot seems to randomly occur.  I would give it 0 stars if possible 
 Pros: Good weight, easy to use.       Top port useful for flash drives, etc.  Cons: Mine died after a month of use       Built-in, super skinny USB cable looks fragile -- if the cable wears out, the hub becomes useless!       I didn't care for how much the ports on the back flared out 
 I have enjoyed Baldacci's work before but this book was simply awful.  I couldn't believe any of the characters and the storyline was terrible.  I was very surprised to get such stilted writing from Baldacci.  You can miss this one in my opinion 
 This will be less of a formal review and more of a personal take, more or less. Due to the fact I've read several intro books, as well as the primary source material, i have a well-informed frame of reference in the judgment of this book's merits.  Not long ago I said the following: Russell's A History of Western Philosophy? Patooey! The all time worst intro book i've ever read!  Granted, HWP is witty, no doubt. This is probably the book's only redeeming value, meriting it a star. Scattered throughout are gems like: "I would rather be reported by my bitterest enemy among philosophers than a friend innocent of philosophy."   On the other hand.... HWP is overrated, underwhelming, and embarrassingly inept for many reasons.  Overrated? The inadequacy and shallowness of most interpretations of the other philosophers' works is the biggest factor. Worst of all, the flippant comments are amusing, which provide entertainment in a conversation, but are utterly out of place when introducing a serious work. However, Russell's take on Leibniz is reliable, because he did his homework, occasionally.  Underwhelming? Russell, like a well trained 'whiggish', kneels deeply before the altar of John Locke, supposedly the champion of the 'modern liberal republican.' Despite admitting that Locke is an inferior philosopher to Spinoza, the godfather gets more press. Instead of philosophy in the HWP, we get self-serving propaganda.  Inept? Not once does Russell ever truly take a problem seriously. IThe complete failure to understand Kant, the philosopher of the enlightenment, as well as Schopenhauer (skipping the World as Will and Representation is not a good idea, Bertie) is a huge let-down. Predictably, he reads Nietzsche as a fascist (exposes his shoddy scholarship by linking him to Nazi socialism), whiffs on Dewey's brand of pragmatism, and for reasons unknown, devotes a chapter on Byron. More bizarre is the excessive attention paid to Catholic philosophy. I don't think the biographer Ray Monk even figured this out, either. Contemporaries like G.E. Moore gets a single mention and Wittgenstein, who he greatly respected, none.  Quite telling, Russell was shocked at the book's success - he produced it casually, intended it as a potboiler, compiled from the notes for the adult education classes he taught in the United States.  Conclusion: The shallowness, due to its intent to amuse, the odd bulk of space devoted to Christian philosophy, all combine to account for world-wide success for The History of Western Philosophy. It might be a good starter, but it also contributes to the sense that philosophy is not worth bothering with.   Alternatives: Copleston's series is lengthy, but thorough, and far superior. You can't go wrong with Durant's Story of Philosophy, although it is a bit dated. Luckily, Durant writes as well as any writer in English, making that book much more accessible to most. T. Z. Lavine's From Socrates to Sartre concentrates on much fewer big-names, but has a lively narrative that sensationalizes the content.  After you've read any one of these, then try Bryan Magee's books: Great Philosophers and Talking Philosophy where both consists of interviews with scholars. As for a contemporary account, Delacampagne's A History of Philosophy in the 20th century is a delicious read 
 I find this reference book a little disappointing. While not a bad book, it's not comprehensive enough and explanations are (in many cases) too concise. If you don't already know the meaning of the term you're looking up, chances are you won't understand it after reading the item. I also purchased the Harper Collins Dictionary of Mathematics, and here are the good news - it's much better than the Oxford. Much more comprehensive and more readable. It's not perfect either, but if you're going to have only one of these, I recommend the Harper Collins 
 This review is not a review of the book (which, I guess, serves it's purpose just fine), but a review of the price. $70 for a spiral-bound book!?!?!?! As if college isn't expensive enough already 
 Two years ago I decided to get healthy and mostly became a vegan. I wasn't unhealthy, Just thought might as well start getting super healthy before it was too late.  I thought this book was a gift from the gods as I wanted to be "low carb" and had been concerned about where to get my protein. Well, I felt okay at first but never entered the proverbial "zone."  Within a couple months, fatigue, spaciness and dizziness, I also started gaining weight and then diagnosed with hypothyroidism. (TSH way high)  Nothing in my life had changed but all the soy I was eating. And I think if it hadn't been fuzzing up my brain I'd have figured it out a lot sooner.  I now refuse to eat soy and am getting better.    I am angry that Sears wrote this book and that he never bothered to research the subject properly and tell readers that soy can be really bad for us.    I see below that there's a new book out on the dangers of soy.  Well, I'm getting it, will review it and if it tells it like it is I am definitely telling everyone I know.          
 I give this DVD 5 stars for baseball, but zero for its simply awful 80's-era TV production styles.  The main problem with this video is that the majority of at-bats are NOT shown.  So you have no way of really following how the games developed.  Only key plays are shown, but usually you are just dropped into the situation (runners, outs, etc.).  The rest of the time is filled with some truly awful musical sequences of players and fans.  For the baseball that is actually shown, this video is a lot better than nothing.  You get some great moments with Whitey, Ozzie, Willie, and a the rest of the Cardinals 80's-era greats.  But you also have the pain of watching the Cardinals loose two of three World Series.  For the record, I'd like to say that Don Denkinger's call at first in game 6 of the '85 series was completely and utterly wrong.  This video proves it 
 This book reveals the ideology behind new American unilateralism and the philosphy that underpins the Bush doctrine;  "Might is right" or machtpolitik.  Kagan's (sometimes sneering) analysis of the European world view is a simplistic one.  He contends that Europe favours diplomacy and international channels before military action not because that might be a altogether preferable way of conducting diplomacy, but rather because Europe is militarily weak.  Kagan assures us that, if the EU had the muscle of the USA, it would be as quick to dismiss internationalism and embrace a more militaristic and unilateralist foriegn policy, just like the USA does today.    In otherwords, European objections to the Iraq invasion were due, not over concern at the motivation for it and the shoddiness (now laid bare for all) of the intelligence that supported it, but simply that the EU doesn't have the military might to conduct such operations.  The benefit of hindsight illustrates how preposterous and, well, wrong, this idea is.  This is the central and oft repeated tenet of the book.  It would seem to me that the target audience for this book seems very much to be readers who already agree with current US policy.  The arguments are facile, hollow and repitious.  I cannot imagine it convincing anyone, not already of Kagan's persuasion.  Kagan refers to "Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction" as a pretext for military action with the same assured certainty with which he talks about how the EU is living in a fantasy paradise secured by American power.    Looking to the future he sees only decline for the EU as a power and continued dominance for the USA.  It is a measure of how flimsy some of the arguments in this book are that he fails at this point to even mention the gargantuan and record-smashing  defecits the USA is currently running as the Military Industrial complex gorges itself once again on taxpayer money.  It's a very short book, but gave me a better understanding of the dangerous views that are shaping the policies of the current administration 
 I've read all sorts of books throughout my educational career...from James Joyce to dry sociological texts. I've read books so dull I could feel them sapping my life energy. Never before, though, have I had to suffer through a book as mind-numbingly awful as 'Member of the Wedding.' Mere words cannot communicate how bad this book really is. It follows the pathetic, worthless existence of Frankie, the most unlikeable, irritating, sorry excuse for a human being ever to disgrace a piece of literature. This book reads like a bad Linkin Park video, and consists largely  of Frankie whining about wanting to belong, and wanting to travel with her older brother, who is about to get married. The ONLY thing I can say for this book is that it is relatively well-written...obviously, Carson McCullers was a good writer. But Thomas Harris wrote 'Silence of the Lambs' and the he wrote 'Hannibal.' 'Hannibal' is a god-awful book, and it STILL doesn't approach the level of putridity reached by this claptrap.  Of course, many reviewers would have you believe that this book is about the awkwardness/isolation/loneliness of acolescence. Bull. I was an awkward/isolated/lonely teen, and I did strange things, but Frankie's actions are downright bizarre, inexplicable, and only serve to make you loathe her further. For absolutely no reason, the author kills off a couple characters at the end, just to make sure that if you weren't suicidally depressed by the book by that point, you sure wouldn't have a reason to live after finishing the whole book. Like I said, think bad Linkin Park song: garish, whiney, needlessly depressing, and completely pointless. There is no message here except that there is no hope, no moral except that life is empty, pointless, isolated, and lonely. I'm a big fan of literature/music/art that emphasizes such themes as isoltation and abandonment...and thus, I tend to enjoy such works even if they're pretty lousy. This, however, was the bottom of the barrel in cheap, exploitative, pathetic, useless literature. If you want to read something that deals with isolation/abandonment/loneliness, read Eugene O'Neill's 'The Iceman Cometh' 'Long Day's Journey into Night' or 'The Hairy Ape' I promise you will find all much more well written and moving than this garbage. In conclusion, when I finished reading this vile book, I hated the main character, I hated the human race, I hated  the author responsible for my suffering; but most of all, I hated myself, for subjecting myself to this bloated corpse of a novel. Read it on the toilet, or better yet read something GOOD and save this to use as toilet paper. Consider it an appropriate afterthought 
 According to the IMDB this movie is the first one specifically made for PC downloading...it shows.  Without any creative vision at all; horrible lighting, acting and editing and a confusing, muddled storyline, INCUBUS is everthing a bad horror movie should be.  Tedious.  Stupid.  And just not worth it, folks 
 I'll add my complaint to the others who find that bundling Cold Comfort Farm with another movie I don't want is stupid 
 while not one of his best novels, tommyknockers was much better than this waste of time! jimmy smits does his best,but the underwritten screenplay does him and this movie about dead aliens and the thought control they have over a small new england town is just not worth the trouble!! SKIP IT!!!! 
 This book does everything exactly WRONG. He asks over two thousand women what they THINK they want in a man, rather than who they actually fell in love with.   Everything has two sides. Nobody is strong and sensitive, pasionate and gentle. Rational and emotional. Tall and short. They are opposites.  Women fall in love with men who are stronger than they are... Then they spend the rest of their lives complaining about them. Why? These guys cause women so much heartache, yet they keep falling for them.   Love and lust are emotions. Here's a tip... If you ever read profiles on a dating site, look at what a girl says she doesn't want, and be that bloke. Because that is exactly the type of guy she falls for, again and again. That's why she (rationally) asks for the opposite. But love is emotional, and she will continue to fall (lust-fully) for these guys.  Love and lust are emotions. They are not logical. This book confuses the two. This book ends up being a damn good guide about what NOT to do.   If you want to be the 'guy' friend of beautiful women, the guy they call when they are feeling bad, then read this book. They will call you when they breakup. They will call you and invite you out and leave you hanging when they pick up some other guy. They will ignore you while they are happy with this other bloke, only to call you when they are in pieces again. You'll put them together again and they will ignore you again. again and again. If this is what you want, read this book.  On the other hand, if you want to be the bloke they actually fall for, sleep with and marry, do exactly the opposite of what this book suggests 
 I miss the shows like "Roco's Modern Life," "Angry Beavers," and "invader Zim" (Which is all right because that show is already on DVD). I want these shows to be on a disk 
 This book appears to be the " book" from "MUSIC MAN  from the way it is listed.  It is not however.  It consists of songs from the show with melody line only printed in extra large notes. Each note contains  the name of the pitch writen inside.  It is only marginally useful as a  teaching tool for children and is defintely not what it appears to be in  the Amazone Catalogue! 
 In the beginning the led seemed to stay bright for a considerable amount of time, but now after almost no use (except fooling with it) it doesn't remain lit for even 5 minutes. Very very poor buy 
 I just finished reading Ida Lupino and was so disappointed.  The author is not a biographer - he's a second-rate journalist at best.  He managed to cull together a great many facts and just tossed them around, hoping for a narrative.  There are so many things I'd like to know that just weren't answered.  An example - Ida had one child, Brigett.  She's mentioned a few times, then qualified as the center of Ida's life and the main reason for her giving up her directing career - to stay home and raise her.  Yet we learn absolutely nothing about this daughter.  No personal description, no personality profile, no private life or professional info.  All that is said is that when she grew up, she moved out of the house and moved "far away from Los Angeles."  These facts would have been easy to find, but the lazy author just glossed over whatever he didn't have. The style is high school level - things repeated over and over and restated in sentence after sentence and rephrased a paragraph later.  Terribly amateurish.  Didn't he even have the benefit of an editor?  Lastly, the author has fallen in love with his subject and lost all perspective on both her flaws and her achievements and lasting importance.  There's no solid analysis of her acting technique - just carefully chosen trade reviews that are most favorable to her.  Ida Lupino mastered basically one type of performance, and she gave it over and over again.  For a particular type of role, she could be extremely effective by displaying her tense, neurotic personality.  But she certainly wasn't any great actress, not by anybody's standards, except the author's, and definitely only a competent director, not the female William Wyler the author tries to paint her as being.  Lupino deserves a far more thorough and honest bio than this 
 I bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys, who enjoy books on cd while driving to and from school.  They did not like the narrator's snobby french accent nor could they understand many of the words.  This is a great cd for high school or adults but not children.  A bust for us.  
 The paper version is a real touchstone for the practice of all manner of applied mathematics.  The CD-ROM version belongs in the discount bin.  Here is why:  1)  The CD-ROM is edition 5; but edition 6 has been out for 4 years.  2) The DynaText software, which is needed to read/browse/search the book, is showing signs of age.  It works fine on the computers of a decade ago but not necessarily on the machines of today.  See the review of J.F.Groote.  The product is advertised as working on Macs but will not work on most Macs.  Specifically, it does not seem to work on either G4 or G5 hardware with OS X, even under the so-called "Classic" mode.  I believe that the problem is that the browser is shipped as an executable that requires a specific architecture.  It is usable under Windows, but you might need to use one of the backwards-compatibility options to run the installer.  It will not apparently run under any form of Linux, the most recent (and rapidly becoming the most popular) transmogrification of Unix.  Again, DynaText is put on the CD-ROM as a binary executable; if you are not using SunOS 4 or 5, Solaris or SGI IRIX 5.2 then you can not use this product 
 This obviously is a re-release of the OLD "Empire Strikes Back" kit released in the 80's.  A decent size kit (approx 15 inches) it gives an experience modeler a good opportunity at super detailing.  The kit is relatively easy to build out of the box, but it has many inaccuracies most notably the inaccurate sensor/bridge deflector DOME on top of the ship.  These inaccuracies can be addressed by looking in the Internet for replacement parts and articles on addressing those inaccuracies.  However, the kit is worth the price.  My only disappointment is the kit is not in scale with the new "Republic Star Destroyer" from "Revenge of the Sith".  The new kit for the new movie is over 19 inches long.  In order for this kit to be in scale with the current movie version, it would need to be about 24 inches long.    Hopefully someone will make the "Imperial Star Destroyer" to that scale. 
 I completely recommend this book if you like being underwhelmed, or if you want to be whipped into a catatonic stupor. If you must read it, get it from the library so you won't feel like you did when you bought the Ding King from the TV commercial. (As for the writing style, I'm not sure our president can push a subject against a predicate, at gunpoint.) If this was written by a ghostwriter, he or she should be taken out and shot.  As for the veracity of the text, don't believe it. Karen Hughs, the probable ghostwriter, called up Bush's former national guard base after he became governor, or the national guard's commander-in-chief. She told the commander she wanted to be able to check his records. Translation: I'm going to purge anything bad about him before I write his book.  George's words ring as hollow as his vaunted national guard record and his smirking heir of superiority. This book says that he continued to fly for a number of years, which was patently false. After his two million dollars worth of training, he tried to get a slot in the Air Force post office of another base in Alabama. He was turned down. Then, he refused to take his flight physical. Flight physicals are orders, not requests. Years later, Karen Hughes would tell a cowed press that Bush didn't take the physical because his personal physician was in Houston. No one questioned that these exams are given by Air Force flight surgeons, period.  This book was not only inaccurate, but dull and too self-serving. I recomment it only as a Christmas gift for a person you only pretend to like. (Don't forget to add drums and trumpets for his or her children too.) The collapse should be total.   By page 5 this book was by my bedside as a cure for insomnia. (A Charge to Sleep.) If you have a choice of painting on New Year's Eve and watching it dry, or reading this, go with the paint.   If someone gives this to you, change your home phone number. It can only mean he or she really doesn't like you.  Look for this book in a clearance bin near you.  
 Ugh....I never write Amazon reviews, but this book truly deserves a bad one.  I can't believe other ppl gave it such great reviews.  The characters are shallow and moronic to say the very least, Lizzy being one of the worst characters in the piece, and unfortunately the protagonist.  And I totally agree the use of "vereee" constantly got on my nerves, and so did all the brit slang used by these "Americans" (???).  I did not like one character in this book!  What a disappointment...I was looking fwd to a nice fun read. 
 After getting past Richard Light's pompous Harvard attitude, I was dismayed to be presented with nearly unpublishable material. Light's writing style, to put it mildly, is attrocious. It's hard to read for content when the author uses cliches every other sentence, rambles incoherently, and assumes a haughty air. For example, is it really necessary to use the word platitude six times in ten pages?  Light presents himself as an authority, constantly referring to himself as a statistician. He seems smug as he presents his "new" findings, which will have a profound impact on students across the country. However, anyone with common sense would have known these platitudes without needing countless surveys and interviews. According to Light, who would have thought that out of class experiences were at all imprortant? But then again, anyone with Light's intelligence might need some guidance.  I got nothing out of this book, and I don't think there was anything to get out to begin with. Maybe it was intended for faculty; as a student, I found it meaningless. Please don't waste your time reading this 
 I got this phone cause I thought it would be a nice little phone. Wrong. Yes it plays songs. Yes it is little. Too little!!!! This phone is not made for someone who has med to large fingers. The voice dialing DOES NOT WORK! It is hard to use. I returned the phone after only 2 DAYS! I got the Samsung T629. TOTALLY better. Does almost everything the Nokia does, but is better, looks better performs much better. If you are a teenager this phone may be good for you. The Samsung even sounds better. Get the Samsung, same price more phone 
 In the begining of this book its was adventursum and kept you on the edge of your seat but I started to get board around the middle and had to put it down. The story line of this story was interesting and exciting in a  mysterious sort of way but really isnt worth reading. If I were you I would  skip the reading of this boo 
 I devoured the first three books of this series. My heart was with Wynn and Elizabeth, I ached to know how things turned out And after begging my husband, he finally went and got it. I started to feast, aching to know if they would ever have a child.What other adventures were in store?  I flounderd toward the middle of this book. Having to re read and back track a little, but it was no use... It did not even seem to be the same Wynn and Elizabeth. They did not seem to speak the same, care the same. They lacked...themselves. I put it down, stopping there and  just sat...not completing it at all 
 i agree with all the people that wrote the reviews. i found this hard, difficult and very upsetting and i still don't get it. they want you to buy their products for these boxes that aren't cheap and i have different products in the area i live in and i am just trying to do one correctly and get it done with all of the extra material i have and i can't seem to do one correctly. the directions are hard and very hard to understand. not clear at all. i am still trying to figure which part to put the material to. i bought a double sided adhesive and i just can't tell where to cut the material out at. very hard for a beginner. tracy  
 This book is offensive to at least one of the two genders, though it's hard to say which. It suggests that a man whose brain was transplanted into that of a sensual woman would become a wanton harlot, more or less. Whether that's more insulting to the male brain or the female body, I'm not sure, but the book portrays neither gender realistically.  I like Heinlein, and the first 100 or so pages of this book show a lot of potential, but after that the book descends into vapid sexual morass, and it's not even particularly good at being that.  The gender-swapping theme has been a common one in fiction and film in the last 30 years or so, but Heinlein joined the ranks of the many authors and directors who treated it as a chance to write pseudo-enlightened erotica instead of literature. More's the pity 
 I read the review for this product on Amazon. Lindsey who is one of the 2 reviewers of this product actually had posted a video of the product usage and I was very much convinced by that. I thought the product is good and ordered it immediately. The product arrived in 4-5 days and was in good condition.   The most important problem with the roti maker is  1. the roti/tortilla is not cooked properly. It remains very much uncooked. Even though you see it puff and everything from the inside it remains uncooked which actually causes a lot of acidity problems.   2. Also such an uncooked tortilla when left for a few minutes becomes very dry and difficult to eat. You have to eat the tortilla immediately within 10-15 minutes of the making. Just imagine if you are making 5-7 tortillas the first one will be come dry and difficult to chew.  3. The product works as described but the tortillas are not at all good for health since they remain uncooked in the inside 
 take 2 ugly men and toss in an overhyped horrible singer/actress and youve got another razzie.minus j-lo and this might have been a 2 star movie 
 The Time Traveler was in his lavatory when he went into the future. This part was good but it was a little slow and too specific about how he felt. The Time Traveler landed in the year 802,701 and life was completely different. This part was alo slow but it was interesting to see what the author thought about the future.  In this book there were many different settings. One of them was at the Time Travelers house in 1809. He was gathered with his friends and showed them a model of his Time Machine. Another one is in the future. There was tall buildings and a river. The people were called Eloi. There were also wells were the evil Morlocks lived.  The main problem was the Time Traveler's machine was missing and was now stuck in the future. He thinks the Morlocks have taken it. So, the Time Traveler must find a way to defeat them.  This review was written by E.O 
 The music is beautiful, but I was really surprised with the poorness of presentation.  The CD jewel case was badly damaged.  The cover fell off as soon as I removed the plastic wrap, and the bottom corner of the case was completely missing.  It's all an enigma -- the shrink wrap was intact and there were no small pieces of plastic anywhere.  Perhaps this was a returned CD?    But back to the music - it is relaxing.  There are only a few songs on the CD, which explains the low price 
 This book goes to my bio as one of the worst I have ever read. Bad history, bad caracters and especialy bad scenes. Like the one in which a barmaid  figths and defeats plate armored dwarven warriors with a dagger!      Her description of how magic works in a ADD world and of events in the  Dragolance Saga reveals that the author had only passing knowledge of both  at time.     Dont take me wrong, I am a great fan of ADD and read dozens of  novels set in Dragolanced, Ravenloft,Dark Sun and others TSR worlds. I had  good expectations for the book.I was disapointed 
 ok.. i love atreyu. seriously.. i have an atreyu tattoo.. but there is NO NEED for a GH album already.. seems like they just want some quick cash. the album cover sucks.. and this really just isnt neccessary 
 I have read every book that has been written about Lucille Ball and this is by far the least accurate, odd, book that has been written about the legend. Timed for release, immediately after her death, "Lucy in the Afternoon" chronicles one boys obsession with the entertainer that he, later in life, confuses with a soul-mate type frendship. Very odd reading. Stories are quite obviously fabricated and I find it highly unlikely that Lucy went into great depth with this man about her life. Covering everything from her broadway days to her ex-husband to her movie and televison career. These are highly personal topics to be discussed with what was a stranger. An aspiring writer. This book should deffinetly be skipped by avid Lucy readers and just readers in general. There are far better books about Ball out there.     I would suggest the most recent release "Ball of Fire" or the excellent "Desilu, the story of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz".  
 This book is simply awful. I gave up after a hard slog through ninety percent of this dreck. The author simply can't write. It sounds callous, but after enduring this book I feel less sympathy towards the yound Marines fighting and dying in Iraq. No wonder they call them grunts. I made a resolution long ago to never read books by the enlisted and this book reinforced that. That Mark Bowden of Black Hawk Down fame endorsed this book is unfathomable to me. Read 'A Rumor of War' by Philip Caputo if you want a superbly-written account of war. On the other hand, if you want to waste time and money, read Jarhead 
 It just astonished me as how certain discursive formations can actually lead people to believe as the 'real' reality. It does not matter whether for an event to 'really happen' or not. What matters is that you hear it on a radio or read it on a newspaper or website or even talk about it at the water-cooler. Those who have had the chance to watch 'Wag the Dog' might get the idea of how such 'reality' is constructed.  On a more advanced level 'discursivity', a la Foucault, is a building block of a discourse in which certain linkages, here and their, add to what ordinary people believe on the street.  Now obviously Hitler was one of the worst things that happened during the 20th century. This is commonsense. But to add certain 'material' so as to advance another claim by building upon Hitler, is something that should be carefully approached, at least for people who at least visit and read stuff through Amazon. If a chain in a series of discursive formations can be shown to be weak or invalid than it would be proven that that chain of a discourse is on shaky grounds, and that most of what is known about it is likely to be false. Unfortunately we see certain 'material' is attached to certain claims so as to resemble the Holocaust. Let us revisit a single claim on part of those would like to exploit the events during the early 20th century. A reviewer, for instance, obviously bought one claim and thus knows it to be the 'truth'  Adolf Hitler: "Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?"  Now has anybody bothered to investigate it. No, of course. "It sounds like as if it is true, so why not believe it". Well fortunately there are still people who like investigating such stuff. Read for example : Heath W. Lowry Washington, D.C. Political Communication and Persuasion, Volume 3, Number 2 (1985) Abstract This article traces the history of a purported Adolf Hitler quote which cites the perecent of the world's lack of reaction to the fate of Armenians during the First World War as a justification for his planned extermination of European Jewry in the course of the Second World War. By a detailed examination of the genesis of this quotation the author demonstrates that there is no historical basis for attributing such a statement to Hitler... [...] If one is serious about really getting into history, rather than believing simply what is out their in the popular press, I would additionally suggest to take a tour of the documents of Ambassador Morgenthau. First let us not take any word for having a Godly truth 'Its ambassador so its gotta be true' mentality is ok if you're ok with it (respect of thought). But there are historical evidence that suggests that Morgenthau did not even know Ottoman scripture, and that this is proved throughout his letters when he attempts to translate 'words' and 'dates' of events. Do not hesitate to read... [...]   For those who have CAREFULLY read what I have written so far, notice I am not either on one side of the argument between Armenian historians or historians of the Ottoman empire, but that I have just thrown out some thought provoking information so that one will at least ask some questions before believing what they read. Doubtless there will be those occasional pointless replies to this review, but again all I am saying is, think before you react. Now one could argue that I am saying is a postmodernist crituque and historical relativism. That would be false. I believe in historical analysis, as a scientific enterprise (and only the scientific version of it). But then again let us not forget that some American historians who were studying the case at hand were bombed by Armenians. Now if history is written by historians and that some historians (i.e. UCLA professor Stanford Shaw)are bullied so as not to investigate certain historical matters than, at least if you have a capacity to think critically than be suspicious about it. [...]  The latest British governemeents acceptance that the "blue book", which Armenian claims are based upon, have been declared by the government itself to be a WW1 time propaganda material. Yes you heard it right! Well I hope I contributed on an intellectual level and I hope 'thought thugs' would not misunderstand what I have suggested. 
 This was my first introduction to Ayurveda despite studying yoga for several years.  I cannot judge how faithful the instructions in this book are to true Ayurvedic medicine; regardless of that, this book makes some strange and potentially hazardous medical recommendations.  Pages 143-144 recommend taking the heavy metal mercury to "enkindle the enzyme system...and regenerate the tissues."  Page 143 recommends lead as a cure for several disorders including skin diseases and venereal disease.  Neither of these recommendations are accompanied by a warning that modern medicine has clearly identified these two metals as being toxic to humans.  While these metals are promoted without warnings about their toxicity, the author warns readers about the dangers of vitamin intake.  On page 87, the author claims that overpresciption of vitamins to patients by Western physicians may cause them to suffer from "hypervitaminosis." Page 140 makes great claims about the curative powers of onions.  It claims that when used as a nasal inhalant or as eye drops they will relieve acute epileptic seizures, reduce cholesterol, and serve as a heart tonic.  Ouch...that stings even just thinking about it. If the preceeding prescriptions haven't deterred you from subscribing to this book's recommendations, then the following might.  Pages 42-44 suggest drinking a cup of your own urine each morning in order to cleanse and detoxify your large colon 
 This book is not at all what it seems.  The Mapmaker's wife, Isabel, whom the story is supposed to be about, does not really enter the plot until page 200.  If you like math and the history of how the world's shape was calculated, this journal-like book is for you.  If you are looking for a story and character development, make sure to pass this one up.   
 I'm a very spiritual person and I was expecting this CD to provide daily inspiration and help me to remember the very few things that are important in life.  Unfortunately, for me at least, the CD is rather boring and not very inspirational.  I'm about 30 minutes in to it and have decided to stop listening to it.  Fortunately I have a Christian radio station that does a lot more for me. 
 This book is a worthless exploration of the city through the dubious analytic framework utilized by Mike Davis in "City of Quartz."  What separates that book is Davis' intimate familiarity with Los Angeles as a lifelong resident.  Whereas D'Eramo is an Italian who's polemic is as cliched as any other European assessment of America which comfortably embraces false stereotypes and broad generalizations about american urban culture.  What mystifies me about these modern marxist urban theorists is they vilify modern american cities, yet ultimately believe that cities provide the best social mechanism for engineering their normative philosophies.   anyway, none of this is to imply that Chicago is immune from criticism.  It is, as is any city.  It's has a sordid history of racism, corruption, an dubious institutional choices.  But any comprehensive analysis of Chicago that refuses to recognize Chicago's virtues or at least attempt to understand Chicago on Chicagoans terms is intellectually bankrupt and a worthless read. If you want great polemic pick up the works of the great chicago polemicists Algren and Royko, not the work of this Italian Huckste 
 This book can't find it's niche. Even though it is commonly classified as a "teen" bood, the language in the book is as bad as "Scarface" or "Pulp Fiction", with the "f-bomb" being as common an expression for these teens as "awesome" was for teens in the 80's or "cool" in the 70's. This could be excused if the characters were interesting, but the characters on sit-coms are more interesting than the supporting characters. The supporting characters throughout the entire book are wooden props for the author to make social commentary, and after a while it feels like one is being beat over the head by it.  The only thing "adult" about the book is the themes discussed. Let me sum them up for you: rampant consumerism ruins everything it touches, being a non-conformist is not without a cost, big business is bad, humans are destroying the Earth. Pretty common dystopian SciFi pablum; these themes have been done before, better.  One of the most shallow, hackneyed ways to develop pathos, the sickness of a child, is used in this book. Predictably, the impact is superficial, much like driving by a train wreck, interested yet disconnected, but able to drive on with the rest of traffic.   I wanted to like this book, the themes explored are important to think about, and the "feed commercials" are truly great satire. However, at the end of this book, there was a general feeling of, "Well, that sucked. 
 I always make it a habit to read a book and pass it on, never expecting it to be returned.  My book is in the pocket of a plane in Paris, hopefully waiting to be thrown out.  I read, and read, and read, with my expectations never being met.  The book was shallow, unbelievable, and way too long.  She could have given her message in the first 100 pages, because there was no message.  I think that she needs to write journals in the areas that this doctor is familiar.  She should stay out of our "fiction" world. 
 It was my fault I did not pay attention to the reader age group 9-12yrs.  I thought this book would have more details in the stories such as in the real Cinderella it mentions that the evil step sister had to cut parts of their feet to fit into the glass slipper, the prince notices the blood and then asked Cinderella the chamber maid to try on the slipper.  This is never mentioned in this version.  Of course I understand this is geared for children, and I was looking for the adult, true translation, version. The same for the Bluebeard story, looks like I will be returning my copy.  Hopefully a younger person can find some use for this book. 
 What we have here is yet another Beatles fan trying to show off what he knows about their songs, and attempting to "explain" it all.  If more accurate histories are to be trusted, the Beatles themselves, particularly their prime movers, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, didn't have a great deal in mind when they wrote these songs.  Nevertheless, far too many authors, including this one, have churned out volumes of "explanation and interpretation" of Beatles songs, what they really mean, how they reflect the 1960s social and political scene, and so on.  The last thing we needed was another one, particularly by an author who, despite his credentials as a classical music writer, is strictly another amateur Beatlemaniac posing as an authority.

 More thn I cared to know about the author's thoughts about himself.  Needs to be cut by half 
 Don't get false hope people! This is not a cure! All this book talks about is Salicylic Acid, Benzoyl Peroxide, Cold Compresses, Retin A, etc STUFF WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT! I followed his directions exactly and I ended up with worse skin than before. I was red, peeling, itchy and still broken out. I have given up on finding a cure, I will probably have acne til the day I die. 
 I am an adult ballet student. I've been dancing for 4 years and wanted to be able to workout at home when I couldn't make a class. This video is not a ballet class workout - there is no bar, center, across the floor setup. There is no music for you to feel as you watch the few exercises they guide you through. It is more of an aerobics class workout. The dancers are wearing dance sneakers!  I'm very disappointed and glad it cost me less than $10 to buy this - I'd return it if I could!  The voice on the tape is horrifically monetone and the dancers are not moving to any type of music - there's the same background music playing the whole time so you can't even feel a pattern. Do not waste your time on this if you are looking to mimic a ballet class workout. 
 Hmm I wonder if those giving this book five stars actually work for McKinsey.  As a practioner, I don't know anyone in the industry who has actually read this book.  It looks impressive on the bookshelf, but the content is anything but impressive.  A lot of topics are covered, but each one only superficially and the writing is extremely dry and boring.  I actually found reading this volume *painful*, and I'm supposed to like this stuff since I do it for a living!  My advice for any potential buyer is read a few chapters first before you shell out for it 
 Nothing you can't find on the internet for free.  I have noticed that most of the five star reviews below of this book come from people who have _only_ reviewed other books by Debra Fulghum Bruce.  And oddly enough, each of them have been given five stars too.   Shameful 
 Terrible, all around bad movie. Don't waste your time 
 This book was the required textbook for a Master's Degree course in library science which I recently completed.  I wish the instructor would have chosen a different book.  This book is full of technical jargon that is very difficult to understand.  Having worked in a library for the past ten years, I still found the terminology used in this book to be very hard to follow and comprehend.  The examples that are given are difficult to understand, and the text itself is extremely difficult to read and digest.  For an introductory textbook, this book is very difficult to read and understand.  I got very little out of reading it, and I sometimes found myself having more questions after reading the book than I did before.  If you are a student that is required to use this book, I can only hope that you get more from it than I did 
 When I was given this book by a guy friend, I thought, why am I getting a book from a Jackie Collins type writer? I had heard of some of Sydney Sheldon novels and most of them seem like JC or Danielle Steel like potboilers that appealed to housewives. but I gave it a chance and I finished it two days later.   The book revolves around Tracey Whitley (as referred to as TW in the rest of the review), a well to do computer programmer who is engaged to a wealthy banker. However, due to the death of her mother a series of unfortunate events leads her to jail to attempted murder. She was setup.   The book then follows her in jail and then her release and revenge to those who put her there. The last part of the book leads to her new life as a Master Thief and romance of a roguish competitor.   The writing style of Sydney Sheldon is not unlike that of a soap opera. He provides you enough twists and turns to keep you interested, but ultimately his books are like Chinese Food. You consume it and then forget it. It is not because the book is badly written, but because the characters have major flaws.   The main flow of TW is the fact that she is given a cloak of invincibility. Everything she does is perfect, there is literally no suspense later on in the book when she goes to Europe of her getting caught. Her antagonists are idiots, the mafia are clowns and the genius tracking her is lame (and of course crazy). When she lives in a world of cartoonish badguys, of course, she'll come out on top.   Another problem is believability. If anyone thinks that this plot is even remotely possible, they need to get their head examined. TW goes from being a meek, young girl to a Master Thief who easily robs the Prado Museum, the Diamond Exchange in Amsterdam, tricks mobsters and master chess players at their game in less than 2 years. Simply ridiculous.   Associated with the above problem is that Sidney Sheldon does not respect the robbery crimes. They are given like 15 pages each and there is no detail to any of them. Some of them have interesting twists (like how she tricks a emerald dealer in London), but the Prado robbery, pure fantasy.   So maybe that is what Sheldon is getting at all along. He is not a technical writer, he is all about the Female Fantasy (meek, proper woman blossoming into a strong, sophisticated Master Thief who gets the finer things in life and the bad boy-whom she converts). In that case the book works, but from a realism stance, it is a wash....Rating: C 
 Ugh!  I tried, I really tried, but this was just too dry and academic.  I liked the author's premise, and he certainly knows his stuff, but this is definitely not a book for the general reader.  This is written like a textbook for a graduate level course in the various dialects of English.  Not recommended for readers who do not already possess some expertise in this field 
   Stephen Breyer is an affable, erudite, Associate Justice. I look forward to and enjoy my viewing of him on American and the Court. It can easily be stated his book is clearly, and convincingly written. It seems almost apostasy to not agree with the term 'active liberty', yet at crucial moments I am compelled to distinguish between entertaining an idea and accepting it.  The appealing and broad term, is in itself is reminiscent of our heritage to degree close enough to sway me, yet the ratification process that granted life to the then proposed Constitution did have a consensus. I was dissatisfied with the idea that the history we possess cannot inform us to a larger degree than he alluded to. I was curious why he outlined Madison's definition of Faction through Bailyn's prism rather than relying on Madison. More striking he suggests that because the Framers could not agree on whether we should have Bill of Rights, or after had to decide what was in it, that they could not agree on exegesis. We readily can see they understood delegated and retained powers, and even a cursory reading of the Debates for Ratification, as well as the Resolutions forwarded with Ratification illustrate they definitely were not agreeing to any broad interpretation that would enlarge the sphere of the branches of government formed. Madison included the Ninth and Tenth Amendments to highlight the delegated vs.  retained concept. Pointing directly at the Court the New York Resolutions mentioned they were not agreeing to any `fiction' of law that enlarged its powers. A fiction of law is defined as  an `assumption which conceals, or attempts to conceal, the fact that a rule of law has undergone alteration, it's letter remaining unchanged, it's operation being modified' (Sir Henry Maine). As the polarizing of the Constitution Advice and Consent clause is inevitable, how can we the constituencies decide if our representatives are feeding us political planks or constitutional integrity when future nominees are brought forth if we use Breyer's guide as presented? The US is blessed with extant documents from our Founding. Is it out of line for a Justice to be versed in them? We know Law Schools do not teach history, maybe we should ask why is that so if a lawyer wishes to specialize in Constitutional Law?  I have the highest respect for Justice Breyer, I purchased his book and have no laments that I did, yet I cannot hold my self in agreement with many of his concepts. 
 Uh, like it's difficult to review a book that I haven't, like, received yet, dudes.  Maybe if you didn't keep, like, pushing the delivery date to the right, I could maybe, like, have something more constructive to contribute 
 What kind of an experiment was this cable watching thing supposed to be? The guy goes on a hike and imagines he comes back full of some eternal "wisdom" and then sits down and watches TV for 1700 hours straight, and comes to the conclusion that the 1700 hours of TV watching were not particularly rewarding...! give me a break! well duh-of course watching tv for a month straight isnt rewarding! Its amazing that people sit down and write big books making these sorts of obvious points. In the end mcKibben succeeds in shining a damning light on our culture - not through his "experiment" but by publishing the book. A culture, where people can pretend to be clever intellectuals by making the kind of social experiments and delvering the kind of half baked "insights" as McKibben does, is in serious, serious trouble 
 This story starts out pretty successfully. We are shown the life of the brothers in the abbey and their daily routines. This seems to set the tone for a dull plot. Then, the reader experiences the sickness of a brother of the abbey and the mood of the story changes from the placidity of the abbey life to the chaos of trying to help the brother. This livens the book up some, but not enough. Very few exciting events happen between that point until the death of Rhisiart. After Rhsisiart's death, we are thrown back into that state of low-action; only this time, with the added commotion of trying to figure out the murderer's identity. The ending wasn't a huge shocker. It was almost too predictable from the beginning. So, all in all, I would not recommend this book unless you wanted to be easily put to sleep 
 I do not like software. It always hang no matter what I did. Maybe this is becasue it has not finished the index process? I had many many photos  in my computer.  
 Admission to America's elite colleges is an increasingly trying affair. An academically strong, middle class high school senior with no particular claim on a space, "un-hooked" as it is known, is faced with increasingly long odds of acceptance. The "un-hooked" applicant is squeezed by a dynamic made from increasing applications as more high school seniors go on to college and the colleges' own efforts to expand the applicant pool through increasing financial aid as well as recruiting international students even as they hold the number of places in freshman classes unchanged.  In this environment it is hardly a challenge to find a really sharp kid who was not accepted and also to find some "hooked" applicant who seemed rather less than qualified who was accepted. Venting on this situation provides a good release.   Golden vents well, but is unfortunately short on substance. Lacking quantitative data, the scope and scale of the matter escape Golden.   More importantly, Golden does not attempt to address what seems to be the most pressing question: What do we expect of these elite institutions? Do we require that they be social engineers? If yes, to what degree? Failing  an attempt to answer this question "The Price of Admission" is reduced to a voice only of frustration and angst.  For a more thought provoking read, see Harry Lewis's "Excellence Without a Soul". Lewis is not specifically concerened with admissions, as GOlden is, but Lewis is very much interested in the question of what an education at one of these elite institutions should be. 
 Too much repetition.  For each entry:  If you have problems, your local plant dealer can give you advice.  Well, often the advice you get is not accurate.  Lots of references to what his granny grew.  It's great he loved his granny, but that is folksy and not useful information.  Ignores the problems with periwinkle and red tip photinia diseases. Pictures are very good.  Book is well organized.  Bibliography leaves out some important other books by competing radio call-in hosts. I get the impression that Mr. Groom is a nice, well-intentioned man, but this is not a definitive work on Texas decorative gardening 
 I truly like military action novels, so I was let down by this book.  I found the opening scenes, with an exercise being conducted in the middle of a massive hurricane to be somewhat unbelievable to say the least.  While I do know that risking ships and personnel during wartime is part of the deal, risking ships and the same people for an exercise, and one that is essentially a "bet" between the French and American presidents is ludicris.  I also found the paranormal nonsense to be just that, nonsense.  It greatly detracted from the storyline, and that plot was telegraphed ahead of time so blatantly that I pretty much had the book figured out from about page 50 or so.  The gratuitous sex scene was totally unecessary to the book, and seemed to be there just to "fill a square" in the accepted novel formula.  It seemed to me that this book was just a reason to let the reading public know about Mr. DiMercurio's divorce.  While I'm not doubting the seriousness of that situation, I question his using my money to exorcise his personal demons.  A waste of money 
 Cheap quality production!!! This was a Holiday gift for my wife.  When she opened the package, both trays had large chips of enamel missing along the metal edges. It looked like neither tray had been inspected before being put inside the box. Then the "fun" began as I tried to get a replacement for the damaged items from Amazon.  I checked the box on Amazon's on-line site asking to have the set replaced, as I was requested to do, and waited for the E-mail to be sent that was promised in the instructions.  Five days later: nothing, not a word from the company by E-mail.  So, I went to a near-by store that ships things, paid to have the bake set packed up, and then paid for shipping.  Next, I went on-line and did a search on Google to find Amazon's 800 number.  As you will discover, you cannot find it on the Amazon site; at least I couldn't.  I called, sat on the phone for 15 minutes, and finally got through.  After discussing the problem with the representative of Amazon, I got reimbursed for the cost of the packing and postage to send the set back to the company.  And another set was sent.  It arrived five days later. There were no problems with these trays. Bottom line:  Too much time wasted to get the item replaced by Amazon.  Amazon: please, please put your 800 number on your site where people can find it easily.  Also, if someone checks a box asking for a replacement, please get back to the person by E-mail as you promised!!!!!!!!!       
 Yes, some of the stories were good, but even the better ones were uniformly depressing. Please be warned that selection after morbid selection is based on grief-stricken parents and dead, missing, kidnapped and/or murdered and mangled children (sometimes entire pits of them); of the dead children stories, the "Buckets" (ghosts of aborted children) offering several other reviewers mentioned was the MOST cheerful. I'm sorry I bought it, and even sorrier that I waded through the entire thing in the hope that there had to be at least one gem of entertainment in there. I like horror as a genre, and rarely part with books, but this one hit the trashcan. 
 Someone gave me this book alonf with Michael Cunningham's THE HOURS, telling me that both were part of a group of talented young writers.  Let me tell you, Paul Auster couldn't be Michael Cunningham's copy editor.  There are more cliches in the first 5 pages of this book than you could find in a dime store mystery novel. The characters are flat, the story ludicrous.  It tries hard to be some kind of masonic allegory but is so obvious it becomes aggravating.  I read the NY Times review that praises the book for it's series of "ricocheting" coincidences, and I kept waiting for that to happen. IN fact, nothing ricochets.  Everything thuds.  IF you are a lover of language, don't bother with Auster 
 There needs to be a good book written about accessing the world by the physically handicapped, unfortunately this one is not very current.  While it has a lot of information, most of it is so general it is of little use.   If you are an adult who became handicapped yesterday and have never  travelled anywhere, you may pick up a tidbit or two.  Otherwise, don't  bother 
 I order this book because my math teacher recommend it to all the class but it was not what I expect it will be. She tell us that this math book will help us improve our math skills and abilities but its not true! Right now I still have the same skills that I have before I ordered and the exercises and explanations are complicated, simple, fast and hard to figure out. Beside I didn't like how it arrive to my house it was all folded out and it seems like it was already return before and used so don't expect to buy books here again 
 This is a collection of articles written for Petrowski's monthly column in American Scientist magazine. Many are brief biographies of 19th-century engineers; a (very) few look (very) briefly at particular pieces of historical engineering (an article on the Ferris wheel is probably the best); others are ruminations on such hazards of the engineering practice as the stress that keeps them up at night and their failure to be awarded Nobel prizes. These seem quite satisfactory articles for a magazine column but they are slender stuff for a book. And Petroski's tendency to return to the same subjects, pardonable in a monthly column, becomes repetitive when the columns are collected. All but die-hard Petroski fans can skip this on 
 This book began to contradict on matter of King of kings Ismail. In one Chapter author wrote that King Ismail was a great King and was the best thing happened to Iran, the following chapter the author illustarted King Ismail as a burtail King of Iran 
 design of book is very poor--pictures totally unclear and print is crowded making it impossible to focus on the story.  The translations are not bad but there is no effort to organize the material and put it in contex 
 My first Grisham novel, and it reminded me of why I seldom read fiction.  The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility.  Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion.  Absurd!  No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing!  The "storybook ending"just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy.  Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases.  Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago.  Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall.  First Grisham = LAST Grisham 
 I popped the cd into my computer, (entire system at home is set up through my computer, 200 watt speaks etc), but ofcourse i can't play this cd because my cd player on the comp won't recognize it.  The funny thing is that the cd provides with cdplayer.exe which also doesn't work.  So my verdict, stay away from palmpictures 
 Some people seem to be confused about the difference between math and political indoctrination.  Saying this is a book about math is like saying "Miles of Smiles: 101 Great Car Games & Activities" is a book about cars.  You may have a good reason to read this book, but learning math cannot be it 
 I found this book sadly lacking in substance and quality activities. Spend your money on Days of Knights and Damsels by Carlson 
 I love Jez Alborough and this book is great to look at and read and rhyme with -- until you get to the end!  Shame on you duck.  I read this to a group of children at a day care center yesterday and they were shocked at Duck's treatment of his helpful friends.  
 First I will say that JAK was not previously on my must buy list and judging from this book she will not be there any time in the near future.  For me, the characters were undeveloped and uninteresting and at many times annoying.  I didn't even like the dog and I have now been informed over and over that jogging will ruin my knees.  The mystery part of the book seemed almost like it was thrown in as a second thought and made absolutely no sense.  I thoroughly enjoy a well-developed romantic mystery but this is certainly not one.  I might give JAK another chance sometime but hopefully I have helped save someone's time with this title. 
 I purchased this item, after having read about "Banneton" in the book "Rustic European Breads from your Bread Machine". The picture clearly shows 4 baskets, and the description is vague - but you only get one. The basket you get is quite small, all but the smallest loaves would quickly overflow the basket. It looks sturdy and well made. It would have been good value for four baskets - it was too much to pay for a single basket. I didn't actually use it, choosing instead to return it, so I can't comment on how well it worked.. 
 If you are a programmer and in a hurry to implement your own graphics filter then don't buy this book.  Its treament of the various formats is essentially devoid of any examples and detail.  A very superficial book with large fonts a "buttons" fulfilling the need to ensure bulk to the book at the expense of content.  There is no CD with example coding and decoding examples, very very few tables of giving a graphical view of the file structures.   In short it is a poorly presented and poorly written book...hardly worth $10 rather than the $25 they are asking....Go by the O'Reilly book Encyclopaedia of Graphics Formats...expensive for sure but it has what this book lacks and that is content 
 I fancy myself an expert reader, but confess to barely emerging from my novitiate as a chef. I'm busy compiling a library of cookbooks to garnish my newly reacquired bachelor status and freshly cultivated culinary courage. Alas, this particular tome is working its way to dust-gathering status. My most recent experience: I attempted the "Piquant Boneless Chicken Breast," the recipe for which spans pages 132-133. First of all, the split breast at a medium-high heat took far longer than the suggested 4-5 minutes to cook.  So perhaps, I thought, the stove was not hot enough. Nevertheless, I allowed some time for the pan to cool to "medium" before adding the garlic and cooking for 30 seconds, as indicated in the recipe. Although the chicken took longer to cook than suggested, allowing me to believe the temperature too low, the cooled pan burned the garlic (and optional added tarragon) almost instantly.  Adding the chicken stock and lemon juice produced a scorched brown paste in the pan. Now, I happen to love the taste of burnt garlic and tarragon, and I count lifeless brown among my favorite colors, so I quite enjoyed my dinner, but I'm glad the recipe produced but a single portion. I would never have served this mess to guests.   I've now tried and taken notes on six of the recipes in this book, all with similar experiences. I'd think the problem was my equipment and my incipient dotage were I having similar problems with recipes from other cookbooks.  Alas, such is not the case. "The Joy of Cooking," Pepin's books and the stuff the Silver Palate people put out all yield reliably splendid repasts. I note the five star reviews that precede mine and marvel incredulously. 
 I wanted a CD with a sample test that I could actually practice with, on my computer.  On the back of the book it says "Practice taking an exam on your computer using the enclosed CD" There is not even 1 question to practice with.  The CD is full of directions on how to use your mouse and how to use the on-screen menu (during the actual test).  I'm going to return this book 
 So I ordered this shirt and I got an entirely diffent one, the packing slip had the right order #. The shirt I received was long sleeved, crew neck with a notch in it. Ans when I called them,the person I spoke to was not the least bit shocked/ amazed or even willing to send the right one, she just said send it back... think twice unless you don't mind making trips to the post offic 
 I have been a devoted Hiaasen fan from the beginning and awaited all his novels which are few and far between with much excited anticipation.  Although his writing remains flawless and some of his lines are hysterical, the story is just so silly I found it hard to keep my attention focused.  I compare reading this book with watching a sponge bob cartoon which I do with my children on occasion.  Sorry, I just couldn't finish it 
 Love John McCain.  Don't love this book.  Between wonderful stories of individual courage, this treatise on courage and what causes people to react without respect to fear is totally unreadable jibberish.  It makes no sense at all 
 Good Eastwood-Streep movie, but terrible book. The plot itself is fine, but the manner in which the book is written is amateurish and just plain sappy. Skip the book and watch the movie. If you want to read a well-written love story that doesn't insult your intelligence, then may I suggest Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice? Now that's good writing and an entertaining yarn to boot 
 Was very dissapponted with this magazine.  They go unread and get thrown out.  Just waiting for our subscription to run out. It is really for older kids and of very little interest to younger kids 
 I AM A BIG FAN OF THIS SERIES AND HAVE READ THE BOOKS TWICE...ALL BUT THIS ONE. I WISH I HAD NOT EVEN READ IT ONCE AS THE SO CALLED "TWISTS" IN IT DEALING WITH BILL AND ERIC DO NOT FIT IN WITH THE REST OF THE SERIES AND LEFT ME FEELING TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED WITH MS. HARRIS'S PLOT. IT WAS JUST PLAIN NOT FUN 
 The subject of this book is relative of the author who back in the 1840s, converted to the faith of LDS and moved to "Zion" (Utah) where she met with hardship and situations that did not meet her expectations. The book proves to be well written but poorly researched. It doesn't help that the author's objectivity was compromise because she was the author's grandmother, several times removed.  In this book, it seem like Sally Denton is going out of her way to slam dunked the Mormons. Obviously, Jean Rio was misguided or misled about what the LDS was all about. Her ignorance seem to be classical that its based on blind faith and once she awaken to it, she discovered much to her dismay that her new church may not be all that she thought to be. The author stated that the Mountain Meadow Massacre was the cause of her defection but it seem all to pat to this reader. There seem to be a lot of mountains made from this molehill.  I don't think her researched is all that well done. The author depends too much on diary left behind and make several conjectures which are not fact based. The book feel more like a personal biography of author's grandmother (several times removed), its short, readable but ultimately unimportant due to lack of depth to the research. While the subject person was important to the author, its seem like a story of dissatisfied customer. 
 While it's not quite as horrid as the film of the same name, the WHO'S THAT GIRL? soundtrack is still a rather wretched affair.  Due to Madonna's incredible popularity, this disc managed to hit the Hot 200's Top Ten and reach Platinum status in sales, but it's far from a must-own now.  Madonna contributes four tracks, and they all sound like TRUE BLUE out-takes.   Madonna wrote the big hit "Who's That Girl?" (#1 Pop, #5 Adult Contemporary, #44 Dance) with Patrick Leonard, and it's a virtual rewrite of their own superior "La Isla Bonita."  The wistful ballad "The Look of Love" (also co-written with Leonard) is less derivative, but much more ordinary.  The frantic, Steve Bray-produced dance track "Causing A Commotion" (#2 Pop, #1 Dance) fares much better, and is an undervalued gem in Madonna's singles catalogue.    The only other Madonna cut (the generic "Can't Stop," also produced and co-written by Bray) is an obvious throwaway, yet it is still better than any of the other non-Madonna tracks.  The remaining cuts are by other "artists" (I use that term loosely) and are anonymous and unlistenable.  There's a reason why Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi never went anywhere. 
 Before I get to the subject matter, I must say that this book definitely should have been edited much better. There are small, but distracting mistakes quite often. Secondly, the way this college professor cites his sources is disappointing. It is difficult to find where he gets what from unless he comes out and says the author's name in the text, which is not incredibly often. If his "Titles for further reading" in the back is his bibliography, 17 sources from the same publisher? I agree with one of the other reviews. There is not much here that I haven't heard already. It is a wonderful book for beginners who have no clue what masons say about their own organization or if one wants masonic gossip. Personally I would have enjoyed a more balanced book.  Why not get perspectives from those masons who have quit the order? Instead of spending gross amounts of time on telling us names of people who were masons and showing us small insignificant branches, why not ellaborate on groups like the illuminati? Thats a pretty major group not even touched.  It might be more controversial? This book pits the gossip of ages against what well-rehearsed masons say about it. It doesn't give any well-thought-out arguments against masonry any real heed. It would just be nice to get an honest discourse instead of this off kilter type of research 
 This bra is very comfortable once on.  Getting the bra on however is not always as comfortable since it goes over the head.  It rolls together and is hard to get adjusted correctly over your body.  As far as function it is not easy to resnap one handed, which with a baby is all you usually have to work with.  The star rating is only for comfort, 0 stars for function 
 I hate Bright Eyes just a little bit more.  Bob Dylan he ain't 
 This one will be brief. The movie is an excuse for young actors to use the "F" word and demonstrate that cannot act. The characters are cheap rip-offs of the original, which is to say one-dimensional. American Pie presents Band Camp certainly does not flesh them out. One final note: Eugene Levy- How much cash had to be thrown at your to take this one on 
 I love to read about Hollywood, and I know I would enjoy this book if the "Eff-word" wasn't used so much. It proves to me that to get anywhere in Hollywood you have be very low-class and profane. Any really  educated person would have a stronger command of the language. The eff-word is a stupid substitution for any word at all, and I just can't get interested in the book because of it. If you don't mind eff this and eff that you might enjoy the book. Too bad. It could have been a good read 
 Some readers may be interested to know that the setting of this novel -"Sambuco" - is actually Ravello, on the Amalfi Coast, until recently the home of Gore Vidal.  The movie being filmed in the village was Beat  the Devil, directed by John Huston and starring Humphrey Bogart.  (In the book Bogie is the obnoxious drunk Burnsie.)  Cass Kinsovling's household seems to be in the ground floor of the old Caruso Belvedere.  The atmosphere of this book is not unlike the film version of The Talented Mr. Ripley, another tale of Americans in Italy in the 1950's.  For all of Styron's fine writing, this is something of a period piece.  The moral crisis that is at the heart of the book - the "fantastic going to pot" of  Americans in the post-war period - is not of much concern to anyone today.  Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice are Styron's masterpieces.  May he rest in peace.        
 While it undoubtedly is genuine medieval music, it doesn't sound like what you might expect. It reminds me more of something you would hear in an Arab marketplace or bazzar. Alternating notes played on a recorder until it drives you crazy. Many of the songs are rather similar (i.e. bad) and in my opinion it's a big disappointment. I had hoped for something to play at our medieval feasts and SCA re-enactments, but this doesn't make the grade at all 
 Somehow, I thought I remembered most of the Dr. Seuss stories being interesting animations from the 1960s, when I was a child. However, I now realize that only a few proper animations were created (like The Grinch Who Stole Christmas). This DVD is an overpriced, underproduced waste of time. It is merely the illustrations from the books brought to life - poorly. The movements are jerky and silly, the voiceovers are embarassing, and it captures my 3 year old twins imagination about as much as a blank screen. They LOVE the equivalent books, and we read them constantly. They are NOT interested in these amateurish renderings (which at times look like cut and paste silliness like Terry Gilliam of Monty Python fame). If a three year old can tell the difference, then you will too. Even though the animation is limited, in the "Ken Burns" style or worse, the DVD compression is lousy with tons of visible artifacts all over the images. Do yourself and your kids a favor and buy the real books. Random House and Sony Wonder - whose logos introduce these productions - should be ashamed to market such inferior nonsense 
 This book goes on my list of the worst books I have ever read.  It took me 3 tries and a five days to get through the introduction. I had to read it for my Ap US History class, and sure, it was very educational. (I have a test on it tomorrow, so let's see how much I retained) It just took FOREVER!  I spend 7 days locked in my room while on vacation in the beautiful Smokey Mountains. Those 5 days it took me to read the intro are not included. I read all day every day and it bored me to death.  I constantly drifted off and fell asleep reading it four out of those 7 days.  I liked the last chapter... because it was the last. 
 If you buy this shampoo, buy something else with it to get this glue out of your hair. I guarantee you will be disappointed, it is the equivalent of Herbal Essence. (also leaves your hair like glue 
 I was pretty disappointed with the material that covered DNS.  This is major section of the exam, and this is what made me fail twice.  I barely failed both times, but the DNS questions were much more complex than what was covered in the book.    Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of experience with DNS because our org doesn't use Windows DNS, so I think that hurt me, too.  Someone with a couple of years experience with DNS might do fine, but try to get another source if you don't 
 Professor Ellis is a very intelligent man, but he plays fast and loose with the facts, and sometimes he uses his gift for writing prose in ways that mislead the reader especially in, American Sphinx.  Ellis has obviously covered all of the ground with regard to what is known about Jefferson--but he doesn't objectively present all of the factual scholarship existing about our 3rd President.   If you want to know more of the detail of what was all involved with Sally Hemings, you MUST read Douglass Adair's essay "The Jefferson Scandals."  This essay is found in the book: Fame of the Founding Fathers: Essays by Douglass Adair.  Published by W.W. Norton.  Sally Hemings was the daughter of Jefferson's father-in-law; and Sally's lover was not T.J. but T.J.'s nephew (his sister's son).  That's why Jefferson never talked about the "scandal" because his close family relatives were involved; however, not the way Prof. Ellis says.  The unfortunate fact is that Prof. Ellis mentions Douglass Adair in American Sphinx, but he never mentions Adair's research (which Ellis cannot reasonably be ignorant of) on the alleged Sally Hemings-Thomas Jefferson liason.  It's obvious from American Sphinx that Ellis has read Adair's essays.  Prof. Ellis must know that the best evidence exonerates Thomas Jefferson, but he never tells us about that. The well publicized DNA test does NOT prove TJ was the father of any of Hemings' children.  TJ never fathered any children with Hemings and Ellis knows it. Prof. Ellis is intellectually dishonest on this point, and on many other points of Jefferson's life.  Too bad because he would otherwise have written a tour-de-force.  Instead it's a tour-de-FRAUD 
 If you want to learn about Paul Feig's sex life...read this book. There isn't much humor in it, but you learn what a lame-o he was 
 This is a horrible book.  This author is not objective at all and does not have his facts straight.  What is the matter with this guy 
 Simply put, can you trust a book written by a man who made his living telling lies and cheating people out of money?  I feel like I was cheated out my money by buying this book!  Shame on me!  ; 
 Philip Slater puts forth with vehemence and passion his opinions on the trends of hyperconsumerism and overindependence that are driving rifts between the people of our nation and diverting much-needed resources from  instituations designed to create health and well-being. His observations  about how middle-class Americans are alienating themselves by placing far  too much emphasis on material possessions, individualistic thought ("I  am different from all of you"), and an economy that is powerfully  rooted in the need to simply consume and produce goods rather than increase  the quality of life are interesting, though a bit dated, and still hold  much relevance to the current situation today.    Still, the phenomena he  rages against are nothing new to the conscientious among us, and there are  many other views on the problems of loneliness and hyperconsumerism that  prey on us. Slater makes powerful points, and he clearly has a deep desire  to see change and the end of the injustices that characterize our century,  but I found his writing style and thought process to be scattered and far  too extremist to inspire me. His book seemed less of an empirical analysis  of the problems facing our nation and what we can do to solve them and more  of an emotional rant about what he personally feels is wrong and where he  feels we all went wrong. Nothing bad about that, it's just he seems so  angry and hurt about it all that he didn't come close to capturing me  (though the chapter about Vietnam and the last chapter were coming close).      It was a good book, but there are far better books written by far more  inspirational people. Carl Rogers ("On Becoming a Person") was a  psychologist who spoke beautifully and wisely for the healing of the  isolation and misunderstandings in our relationships with each other.  Barbara Marx Hubbard ("Conscious Evolution: Awakening the Power of Our  Social Potential") writes convincingly and with an uplifting sense of  hope about the problems we face as a people and a culture and what we can  do in the coming decades to move in the direction that Philip Slater longed  for. Both these authors, and many others, rationally describe problems we  all face, then offer warm and well though-out advice about what we can all  do. Slater seems like something of a ranter, and reading his book only  depressed me. But hey, read the book, then move on. Good luck 
 i had never heard of anne tyler before i started seeing this book's  hardcover edition all over town. four years later i saw the book again at my local library and decided to pick it up (the demure nape had always intruiged me). what a mistake. i found it redundant, to the point where at certain spots, after i had set the book down, i was positive i had picked it up 10, 15, 40 pages earlier at a passage i'd already read. i soon realized, indeed, i was on the correct page, it was just that a nearly-identical scene was again playing itself out on the page.   how many times does the reader have to experience Rebecca's regret, nasty step (and full) daughters, her doddering senior citizen charge or squeemishness at the touch of her once-true-love? it was the same disappointing non-event over and over.   and i thought this book was also a shameful depiction of one woman's sorry, horrible life. it felt as though she was a mute doormat. i suppose it could be considered a "real" story but Rebecca's lot in life seems to be romanticised. it's not romantic or wistful or nostalgic, it's just sad. 
 Assuming that you put the four double A batteries in the right way, the unit will start to make a humming sound, but as far as being beneficial in keeping an aquarium clean, I see no value whatsoever.  It is a total waste of money.  The unit simply doesn't have enough suction power to be helpful 
 Purchased Teenage Investor for my grandchildren but decided not to give it to them.  While the book gives a reasonable survey of the stock market it promotes the negative theme throughout that we, average investors, cannot succeed and would be better off buying mutual funds.  (So, why write a book about investing?)  This boy-writer (in my opinion) must have garnered a lot of help from dad, a lawyer, an accountant, a broker, a writer, and an editor. I read the whole book hoping to find something that read as if a teenager actually contributed, but I couldn't find it.   
 Did you know that FDR knew about the attack on Pearl Harbor in advance and that he wanted Americans to die to get us into WW2? The author says it, though he fails to prove it. 
 Ok, first off, this is the first Corrs release i've listenend to. I'm offering my opinion without knowing anything else they may have done. I've listened to the cd 10 times or so, on random occasions when i need a break from my normal diet of punk and garage rock.  It sounds good. A little TOO good. I agree that it's overproduced, doesn't sound even remotely spontaneous. The studio work is well done, but OVERdone. I'd like to hear something else to see what they REALLY sound like.  The content of the songs is what bothers me. Aside from being sappy, sentimental drivvel (this is pop music, after all - i wasn't expecting anything else), everything sounds like a commercial ditty or a part of a movie soundtrack. Mmm-hmm.  Track 1 - I see a not-so overweight soccermom smiling on a treadmill at Curves(TM), then hopping in the Ford Expedition(TM), and cheering on the kids at their soccer game with a SunnyD(TM) in each hand.  Track 2 - Helicopter pans out as mid-20's girl drives curvy mountain road in VW Cabrio(TM)(R) with top down, thinking about handsome lover... "LMN"(R) watermark in lower-right corner of screen...  Track 3 - Sad animals. Images of puppys in cages.  Track 4 - Actually, I like this one. Mellow, laid back.  Track 5 - Ugh.  Track 6 - This one is the MOST clever! I see the band members - 3 girls, 1 guy - on one side of a table under a hanging lamp in an otherwise black room, while 3 gentlemen in suits open a breifcase full of money, push it towards them and say, "As you're aware, the radio has lost it's credibility. The kids are figuring out that there are other bands out there, beside what we pump across the airwaves at them. We need to entice them back. If you want a single, and this pile of cash says you do, then you'll do what you can to save this dying medium. Hell, you work in the word "radio" and we'll double what we're giving you." Come on, the song even SOUNDS like a PSA for the International Radio Marketing Council...  Track 7 - Sounds like a Pepsi commercial.  Track 8 - Ugh. Wait, wasn't this Track 5?  Track 9 - Sappy, but ok. Sounds like they actually put effort into the lyrics. Thumbs up.  Track 10 - Not remotely original, but alright.  Track 11 - Interesting sound. Good beat. Correct me if i'm worng, but was that a semi-Pagan reference there? That would be a bold move, for which i'd applaud them, if in fact it is. Not that i'm Pagan or anything, but hey, its a religiously positive, non-Christian reference that doesn't involve Marilyn Manson, and that takes guts. Especially for radio-loving girls bands.  Track 12 - Laid back. Almost has a jazzy, lounge feel.  Track 13 - Produced by former Ace of Base member? Bubbly, upbeat, not too bad.  Track 14 - Written and produced by Avril Lavigne...  Track 15 - WOW! A RELATIVELY CELTIC-SOUNDING SONG FROM A RELATIVELY CELTIC BAND!! And instrumental, too - big thumbs up! In fact, maybe that's the key.  Whatever. Long-winded, i know, but fair. This album didn't turn me off to the Corrs completely, but i don't have very high hopes now.  Flame away, kiddies. 
 This book has an interesting take on how the mind interprets the slightest events between two people such as body language, facial expression and more. The facts laid out are informative. The prose though has much to be desired. Thu author uses "tacit" far too frequently, and clutters his points with obscure and infrequently used words. Commas and em-dashes are not in expected places, leaving you to read many sentences over again to get the meaning. I felt I had to stall way too often and not glide smoothly along. Good scientific work, but bad read 
 What a load of garbage.  Equating a camera with a gun and the act of photography with a violent crime, is so ridiculous it does not even deserve to be discussed.  She has no idea waht she is talking about 
 I don't care how many credentials or degrees or how informative your information is, but if you start to fall asleep every three or four pages or have to read whole sections over because your mind drifts, then you've  missed an essential part of writing and editing. YOU MUST MAKE IT  INTERESTING! I read a half dozen books a month and this read like a text  book, no worse than a text book. It read like a military manual, JUST like  Kirkus reviews says. They were right on target.  Fire your editor and get  someone with a personality to help you write your next book. The only  reason I give it two stars is that the information is there if you can  suffer the writing 
 The sub-header to this book could very well be: "All Work & no Play makes Jack a Dull Boy".   Basically, Tom Stanley's scholarly treatise on American wealth comes down to this mind-ripping, continent-blasting conclusion:   Millionaires, you see:   1) Save more than they spend;   2) Don't spend anything.   That's it. Page after page, chart after chart, graph after graph, anecdote piling up on anecdote, all of it boiling down to the same conclusion: don't spend more than you save. Clip coupons. Hang on to your wife `til Death you do Part. Buy a rambler for 80 grand, and cling to it like a rat clutching a Big Mac in a hurricane.   To wit: if you're a good little Bob Cratchit, and burrow down in your suburban Dacha, drive the Civic, eat Top Ramen, and take your vacations at the State Museum of Knitting & the Fine Arts, you'll die loaded!Sound like fun?   Didn't think so. Look: you've got one life, and after death all bets are off. Sure, you could be hauled up by the angels to Paradise, or it could just be one plate of linguini too many, a nasty flatline and one vast inky void of non-consciousness. Either way, you're looking at one single trip on this not-so-flat Earth, so you might as well live large.   It's true, now: you can haul in major bank in whatever profession you choose: eremetic horror-writer, Wall Street tycoon, Railroad baron, small-town librarian, legal eagle defender of the Criminally Insane, whatever. And you can always outspend it. That is the source of endless tragedy and Dickensian woe throughout the ages, without a doubt.  But there pitfalls at the other extreme. Listen: I live next door to one of these McMillionaires. The guy is this enfeebled little wizened gnome of a critter, used to be a bank Vice President and got bought out because he was a dingus. Total skinflint. Miser. Goes on his own hunting trips and brings back venison, deer meat, which he forces his family of---jesus, I think 12---to eat for months. Lives in a shacky little rambler, buys used Crown Vics from the local police department and bargain basement prices.   The guy, no doubt, is high net worth. But he's also a loser.   This is a guy who didn't want to cough up a few hundred bucks to help build a joint fence between our properties---so there's a fence, even a fence that abuts his property---but beyond my house and demesne, he elected not to build a fence. Instead, he got a plastic Jersey Barricade (orange and white) and went with that. Is that any way to live? Is that really what it means to be a `millionaire'?  I think not. Half the glory of the Age of Great American Consumption is buying stuff you don't need, but want. Desire. Demand. What else is work for?  Find a way to creative bliss, work at something you're good at, that you have a real passion for, and the money will follow.   But for the Love of God, it's only Money: spend it! What is money for, if not to indulge yourself?   Sure, get a pace---plan to the end---set a budget. But how many of you want to be that newspaper column on page A3, the 95 year old dowager pauper who begged for alms on the streetcorner, ate catfood out of a tin, and scrounged for quarters by the bus stop, then was found rigid and cold in the urine-stiff sheets of her dirty bed, sprawled atop a fortune estimated at 20 million bucks? Sound like a plan? I think not. Money may not buy happiness, but it sure as hell can get you a Rolls-Royce Phantom.   "Millionaire Next Door" might have it right in its sociology---and for what it is, Stanley's thesis is meticulously researched, mustered like a well-trained army, and capable of marshalling its teeming forest of facts like a well-drilled martinet---but it's off the map when it comes down to the point of the whole thing: if you've got it, flaunt it.   "Millionaire Next Door" isn't a bad book: it's scholarly, and plods along its own hand-me-down lodestar towards its prophesied conclusion (be cheap! Die loaded!), and perhaps some folks will be astounded to discover there are some real richies down the block who in another day would have been called skinflints.   But as a map to your stars, this one is a little cramped, cribbed, dank, and stinks of mothballs. I think I'll take first class---scratch that, how much did you say that Learjet was going for, again?   JS 
 This is yet another book on how to mold yourself into the perfect little military wife. Give me a break. While it does address women having careers, it emphasizes the need for military spouses to participate heavily in their husbands' careers and placing your spouses' careers first, explaining that eventhough he may not want to or may not need to go to your office functions, you still have to go to his for the good of his career. It is the same garbage that every other guide has.  It does address the ranking system wives seem to think applies to them because of their spouses, but gives you tips on how to be more understanding of it, as if it's okay for people to treat you like less simply because their husband outranks your husband. Ladies, do yourself a favor and worry about having your own lives and your own education and your own careers, cause when he is gone on deployment cookie baking and sitting at home waiting for him, and listening to the other wives criticize you for not  doing whatever it is they think is important is a complete waste of time and it will depress you. You need to develop your own lives and your own talents and hobbies. The 1950s wifely lifestyle will drive you batty. Save your money and use it for something that will uplift you 
 THIS BOOK MISSES ONE IMPORTANT FACT. HURRICANE KATRINA DIDN'T STOP IN BILOXI/GULFPORT MISSISSIPPI, BUT ALSO INCLUDED CITIES FURTHER EAST THAT NEVER RECEIVED MENTION BUT FARED JUST AS BAD IF NOT WORSE THAN GULFPORT OR BILOXI. THIS INCLUDES THE CITIES OF OCEAN SPRINGS, GAUTIER, PASCAGOULA IN MISSISSIPPI AND AS FAR EAST AS MOBILE ALABAMA.  IF TIME IS GOING TO PRESENT AN ACCURATE ACCOUNT OF HURRICANE AS SUCH IT DESERVES I WOULD THINK THEY COULD AT LEAST DO ENOUGH RESEARCH TO FIND OUT ABOUT THESE CITIES AND INCLUDE THEM IN THEIR BOOK. MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE THESE CITIES ARE SO SMALL THEY FIGURE WHY BOTHER. AND MAYBE THAT IS WHY IT TOOK SO LONG FOR THESE SAME CITIES TO RECEIVE AID AFTER THE DEVESTATION CAUSED BY HURRICANE KATRINA.  WHATEVER THE CASE, THIS BOOK MISSES THE WHOLE POINT 
 While the premise of the story - a group of childhood friends called back to experience the last year of their old summer camp - could have had a lot of potential, the movie repeatedly resorts to slapstick humor to carry you from scene to scene, as past and present interpersonal conflicts and relationships are clumsily explored, and trivial and childish behaviors are re-enacted, with the apparent expectation that the audience should remain interested.  I gritted my teeth, but I have to admit that after an hour, I could no longer take it.  
 What in "heavens name" were they thinking? Probably the most gorgeous western ever filmed and they chose to release it in non-anamorphic format? This is unthinkable! Never mind that this epic flopped because of a viewing public with the attention span of a gnat, this film deserved to be released in the best format possible. This edition is the best so far but sorely lacking English subtitles. After repeatedly backing up the scenes in busy downtown Casper I am still to decipher much of the dialogue. The audio mixing could have been better here. What has happened to the directors hand in this release? Was he banned access to this film for all time? This is not the only film for which I have been awaiting a deserving release. The studios often have themselves to blame for their losses when butchering a directors vision simply because they think that the public doesn't have the potential to appreciate. "Reds" was another epic film that failed at box office, yet here it is 25 years later with it's long overdue proper release on DVD. I hope it won't take that long to see the proper release of this film 
 I read The Real Lincoln once and was, in some regards, impressed with the number of sources and the style of writing.  Still, it bugged me because so much that I have read did not allow his pejoratives to ring true.  Therefore, I began investigating its sources in detail, one by one, before coming to a conclusion.  I have found that The Real Lincoln is one the slickest example of half truths, anachronisms, and unfair assaults I have ever read.  So incensed am I that I am preparing a book to counter Mr. DiLorenzo's disgraceful rewrite of history.    Obviously, I can't go into great length here, but let's look at two examples.  1) Several times DiLorenzo scathes Lincoln for ordering the arrest of Clement L. Vallandigham for making an anti-administration speech before Congress in August 1861.  That is false on two counts.  First, Ambrose Burnside alone was responsible for ordering Vallandigham's arrest, a fact well documented but not appearing in Mr. DiLorenzo's bibliography.  Lincoln knew nothing about the arrest order until it had been consummated.  Second, the event that led to the arrest was not Vallandigham's August 1861 speech to Congress but a May 1863 speech that he gave in Ohio.  All this appears several times in the Official Records and contemporaneous newspapers.    2) DiLorenzo cites a number of Republican newspapers that ostensibly criticized Lincoln's policies.  Except when you read the entire article (one from the New York Times, for example) you find exactly the OPPOSITE is true, that DiLorenzo only cited that portion of the article that paraphrased the opposition's thoughts, not subsequent paragraphs where they savaged Lincoln's opponents.  This happens in many other cases such as making historian David Herbert Donald appear to be on the DiLorenzo ticket of Lincolnism when full cites would have revealed something totally different.   Either Mr. DiLorenzo did not do his homework, or he is outright lying.  His obvious purpose is not providing a cogent look at Abraham Lincoln but beating the drum for his modern-day libertarian economic viewpoints.  Only the purest form of the Jeffersonian economic and political model matters to him, and any deviation from it is tantamount to tyranny.  While one may argue the point of minimal government interference, DiLorenzo blasts Lincoln with one pejorative after another and gives but lip service to Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal.  DiLorenzo even goes so far as to blame Lincoln for Reconstruction, as if the dead president were somehow able to lead events from the grave.  Radical Republicans are responsible for Reconstruction, and Lincoln was never a Radical Republican, much less a live one.  I could say much more, but it will have to wait for publication where I can expound at length.   The saddest part of this book is that too many believe this drivel. 
 Sure buy each season like a good trooper and then get shafted.  No extras on the final season, BUT you can shell out another 150 big bucks and get the extras and the whole 11 seasons again.    The Avengers series did a similar thing.  They put out a box set and added a bonus disc with "lost episodes" specials, etc.  There was such an outcry, that A&E allowed people to purchase the bonus DVD separately.   MASH should do the same.  Talk about alienating your customers!!!! WoW 
 The first part is riveting, about a woman misled, then abandoned.  The second is mediocre- interesting but monotonuos and long, the third part is throwaway and even though it is short, it is monotonous as well.  There is not enough humor: a story about a man who chases a pig for 150 pages should  be hilarious but it didn't even bring a smile to this reader's lips.  Don't  waste your time 
 This book was highly recommended at [...] which is a respected forum and website of information for people in the sports photography business.  (pee-wee to pro)  I even paid for overnight shipping as I was very excited to have it.  I was very disappointed when after reading it.  The book indicates it will help users learn to shoot sports or to make users already doing it even better.  It will do neither.  Let me begin by saying the best chapter in the book is where the author talks about his career in professional sports photography.  He works mainly with the NFL and some Division 1 universities.  However, the chapter is quick and not very deep in its storyline.  There are no great stories about games or being on the road.  Instead it sounds like a talk at career day at a High School.  I was really left wanting more.    There is a chapter on equipment but it didn't do much more than go over the basics saying you need a camera with interchangeable lenses and it will need to be digital today.  He did mention that prosumer cameras like the Canon 20D or Nikon D70 were not adequate to do sports.  I strongly disagree with that statement and I think you will find many people doing excellent work with cameras such as that and not just $4,000 and up cameras.  He really seemed to be hung up on frame rate which would mean he is more about machine gun style shooting than more careful shooting and anticipation.    Do you really want to come home from a game with 1000 shoots to sort through?  The chapter on digital workflow spends as much time describing what people used to do with film and slides and developing and scanning.  I see no value in that information.  The digital information is very general and not much use.  It basically said that to check with whatever agency or publication you were working for and do whatever they require.  There is a chapter written by an old NFL Photos Editor describing what they like to see in football photos.  Again, it really doesn't go very deep and states the basics such as vertical shots make better magazine covers and isolated player shots are better for things like trading cards.  He also talked about submitting a portfolio.  He said to send your best shots and not to send out of focus shots.  (Thanks for the information.)    The rest of the book focuses on individual sports.  It covers some sports but not all.  For example, it leaves out sports such as volleyball and golf which I think are important.  The author said once you learn the feel for the other sports, you will just know what needs done for the sports they don't cover.  The chapters are all very weak and while he the book promises to tell you about shooting positions and lens selections, it is not nearly detailed enough to help anyone wanting to become a professional and is generally obvious to anyone watching sports.    For example in football, it says that the sidelines or end zone are place you can shoot from and some people like to kneel when shooting to make the player look bigger.  He also says you need a long lens like 300mm or better plus maybe a second body with a 70-200mm.  There also is mention of strobes on professional basketball and hockey arenas but it is too general for pros and useless for people doing kids/school leagues.  The best part of the book would be the pictures.  However, the pictures are not presented with any type of technical information to help you learn about your camera and lens settings.  At best there might be a quick mention if the written text glossing over the information.    I usually like to think I can find something redeeming in any (technical) book but not in this one.  The information presented is available for free and is better on several photography forums on the Internet.  At least in those forums, you can find other sports shooters (and other kinds too) and share information and interact including presenting your own work for critiquing.    If you would like to see excellent example of sports images, then subscribe to the sports magazines and/or buy some of the coffee table type of book full of sports photos.  This book is not worth the money. 
 This book does not provide enough examples, and the few they do give are nothing like the work problems. Every teacher I've had has said if they were not required to use it, they would use a different book. And on top of that, it is ridiculously expensive!  I have finally been forced to get another text book, and it is much better (and cheaper). Do not get this book if you have a choice 
 At least if you only watch the movie you will save yourself a lot of time, I on the other hand was not so lucky. It is often said that the book is much better than the movie but not in this case. I often found myself saying "Why am I still reading this!" I thought the book would never end. Don't waste your time if you really need to read a novel by the author then pick "A day late a Dollar Short."  
 I bought this book when I was in a hurry.  I wanted a good Vietnam war book to read and didn't take enough time.  Maybe I should have used Amazon ahead of time but so be it.  Anyway, the book is rather a fraud perpetrated by two BBC journalists in order to spout anti-US propaganda.  You will find a lie on just about every page.  When they're not lying, the authors are deliberately distorting or omitting.  I could give examples but if you read the book, you will see what I mean.  The book actually makes a point of mentioning and praising the courage and heroism of the famed American "tunnel rats".  But much of the book is the standard leftist bilge that Vietnamese Communists were "good people".  And much is just the old hackneyed justification for Communist atrocities on a mass scale.  I question the entire book based on the obvious propaganda at the macro level.  Really, if you've experienced enough of that propaganda, then you will gain little from this book and may be left questioning like me - how much of the technical material is inaccurate or embellished or distorted by omission 
 These guys have skills. The cd has good beats, a fresh flow, and some thoughtful lyrics. and thats the problem. its funny how these guys wonder why their music wont get played on the radio. im surprised anyones heard of these guys, and actually still make music. why dont the white people just go listen to some Screwdriver or Boots and Braces? Im white, and I dont listen to skinhead music. This is racist garbage, and if these people can only cry and blame the white man for their problems then all they're doing is giving the power to the white people. they're the ones talking like we're above them. I dont know anyone who thinks like these people say we do. Its a sad excuse to use for cover up for the fact that you cant get a job or complete school. Dead Prez areant starting a movement against anything no matter how hard they try. All this cd did was erase these guys hopes of making it big in the music scene. no airplay, no recognition, no respect. good job guys. stop crying and start thinking. you have the power to change you life, dont expect it from others to do it for you. too bad, such talent, such a pity 
 TickTock is, by far, the WORST book I have ever suffered the misfortune of reading.  After declining his mother's Vietnamese dinner invitation of clay-pot chicken and rice, Tommy Phan drives his piece of the American dream, a newly purchased Corvette, to a diner and opts for two cheeseburgers, fries, and a chocolate milkshake.  After berating himself for not being a more traditional and obedient son, he returns home to find a strange a doll on his doorstep.  Bringing this doll into his home, it quickly morphs into an evil monster summoned by Mrs. Dai, a hairstylist/witch from the Xan River, a mah-jongg partner of his mother who empathizes with Ms. Phan's wishes for Tommy to return to his Asian roots.  What better reason to embrace one's ethnicity than the threat of death by monster summoned by misguided hairstylist.      Tommy and Del (the blonde-bombshell-waitress-stranger-turned-savior-friend-and-lover) battle for their lives and hope to survive until dawn, when the danger is over.  When confronting Mrs. Dai about all they've endured, they receive this particularly heart-felt apology, "So sorry about mistake... want to throw myself in pit so bad."  The real monster is Dean Koontz's book.  Unfortunately, though the protagonist is safe from the clutches of his monster at dawn, there is no spell that will break the 335 pages of horrible story-telling that makes us all want to throw ourselves `in pit so bad.' 
 What's wrong with all you Amamzon reviewers?  I actually quite liked Shutter Island but this was total garbage. The morose tone is totally overdone throughout, and the end is pathetic. The interesting situtation setup in the first chapter is never satisfyingly integrated with the rest of the story.  Avoid 
 Like most indie gay themed movies, "Trick" had quite a bit of buzz around it. A terrific movie with Tori Spelling! How could I not love it?  I loved "Die Mommy, Die!", "Girls Will Be Girls", and "Jeffrey". So I gotta love this too, right? Right??  I found it cloyingly sweet and completely out of touch with reality. A hot go-go boy wants to hook up with a nerdy dweeb?    Uh... why??  So they spend the whole evening looking for a place to get busy.  And then it's one contrived situation after another getting in the way of their plans.  As much as I can't stand Tori Spelling's "acting", she's the only performer not phoning it in. (Maybe she had an extra espresso before the shoots?)  What little life there is in this movie, it owes it to her.  The problem is that both male leads are incredibly dull and not that good looking.  The "sizzling" dancer looked like bored monkey. And the soft, sensitive Gabriel has no personality. Why these two people continue to want to have sex with each other after six hours of roadblocks is a complete mystery.  I guess if go-go boy dropped the zero and found another guy (which wouldn't be too much of an effort for him), there wouldn't be much of a movie.  A cameo by Miss Coco Peru is a nice treat.  But she's lit so unflatteringly and gives a monologue so ghoulish, you'd think she was in a different movie.  High expectations, very low gratification. Honestly, skip it 
 Go elsewhere for a balanced scholarly account, this book is just an attempt to cash in on a false politically-correct warping of history.  Not much good for anything 
 Do yourself a favor and skip this one.  Nothing happens, the killer is zero-percent exciting.  Overall a very lame read 
 Is this book reviewed before it's published? It contains too many errors, some of which are fundamental. Is it practical, if the design equations are only presented, not explained? Anyway, you can  get some ideas for your switching power designs after reading this book. 
 I bought this book to help me switch from Winduhs. It's a lotta words and I later read in his New York Times column that he "types" by dictation into .. I think Dragon Naturally Speaking on a Winduhs based machine (uh hu). The book's contents could have been cut down to less than a hundred pages-- but these books are sold by the kilo anyway. He didn't really know the OS he just banged out a quick book to earn a  yep a quick buck. I read his "consumer" columns in the NYtimes and find them useful but this book wasn't. Oh yeah and the switch ...... to Mac .... over rated but OK. 
 I am a great fan of 50's and 60's sci-fi films. I have a large collection and thought I would add "Gorgo". The problem I have with this film is the man in the rubber suit. Now Godzilla was done in the same way but was very effective. It moved well and was quite believable. Not so for Gorgo. The man in the suit didn't know how to move at all. He often stood upright opening and closing his mouth like an idiot. Sorry to say but this is the worst man in the suit creature I have ever seen and this is coming from a man that loves these sort of films.  
 I try and support Gospel music as much as possible but as usual, I am dissapointed with most secular artist who try to switch to Inspirational or Gospel.  She can really sing, straight BLOW'n on most tracks but it may be a little "blah" to most people that have been into Gospel music for more than 10 years.  Ya know, James Cleavland, Edwin & Walter, Andre Crouch, Commissioned, Clouds of Joy, Keynotes, the Winans (NOT MARIO but Marvin, Carvin, Micheal & Ron 
 There is no doubt that the author is extremely knowledgeable about financial statements, but he struggles to write a clear introduction for newcomers. I finished the book with a muddy, incomplete understanding of financial statements.  In his attempt to introduce financial statements to first-timers like me, the author gets a couple things right:  - it's short. the length is a very comforting 130 pages.    - it's illustrated. there are drawings of scales with profit/loss, etc. This is essential for visual learners like me.  However, the author fails on these points:  - cute phrases instead of genuine insight.  The author's little jokes in the text felt a little self-indulgent, and didn't help explain.  There is one exception: it was useful when the author describes the fans of the various reports - P/L vs Balance vs Cash Flow.  However, most of the rest of the joking was irrelevant and amateur.  - Not well written.  Like many technical books, the quality of writing was poor.  Many parts like first drafts - left me with lots of questions.  The illustrations often felt incomplete and didn't help explain much.   - Expert blindness.  In some ways, experts are the worst people to write books for beginners.  They are passionate about the details and history, which is not what newcomers need.    I understand why financial experts would recommend this book to newcomers: they share the passions of the author. However, this doesn't help newcomers.  I will keep shopping for the book that gives me the basic 'big picture' understanding of financial statements I need 
 There's nothing more frustrating than spending your time watching a bad film, a teacher once said to us; and nothing sadder than seeing the downhill of a good artist. Alfonso Arau, the director, has had the reputation of being a good director, or at least one that cared about his projects enough to make them good looking, well acted, or, at least, interesting. However, in this pseudo version of the great 1941 masterpiece, we can't see anything remotely interesting or attractive. The casting is horrible, but that falls short when describing the awful and terrible acting of Rhys Myers as George (the brat): ...he actually makes Jim Carrey's "Ace Ventura" look underacted and cool; the rest of the movie is, basically, a stink bomb, really, but his acting is one of the most horrible things I have seen in more than thirty years of watching all kind of films. This Magnificent Ambersons is to the (mutilated) original Orson Welles' version like the graffiti version of the Mona Lisa. Save your time, brain cells and money. Watch the original 
 When I bought this book I thought I was buying a book that would help me teach my parrot to talk. Although I do know that there are no guarantees about which bird will talk and what method works, I wanted tips and advice on how to help my parrot learn.   This books gives no such information. It covers why parrots talk, which parrots talk and lots of stories about talking parrots, but no real information on teaching my bird to talk. The only chapter I liked was the one about the Model/Rival-method, which is a detailed chapter on teaching a parrot to talk with cognition, understanding the words it uses. However, the bird must alredy be talking for this method to work.  What I wanted was an answer to these questions: Do constant, out of context, repetitions work? Does plaing a casette work? Would it help to have talking sessions? Does my tone of voice matter? How can I get my bird to talk more clearly? How can I get my bird to talk in front of strangers 
 The book, while succeeding in getting you into a  "Taking the test" mindset, failed in applicability here in NY state. The civil service test here bore no resemblence to the types of test questions or format as presented in the book. Other texts for specific careers, such as police or firefighter, have been far better in my experince in being pertinent to the topic, some had even had questions almost identical to the test I took.  
 Mark Fleischmann's book, Practical Home Theater... is too simple.  It is little better than the manuals that come with your system components.  It is not suitable for the individual seeking to design and install his home entertainment system 
 Lots of big words, but little substance. I give it an "A" for effort, but the outcome is a big "D-" and that is generous. 
 The Last Samurai is a re-do of the 1990 borefest Dances With Wolves.  Once again, a formerly evil American U.S. Army officer comes to the aid of an indigenous people who are threatened by evil predatory U.S. imperialism.  At least that is what the filmmakers would like you to believe.    Actually, the Japanese samurai were an oppressor class in their own right.  The samurai preyed on the peasants.  Eventually, as reformers took hold in 19th Century Japan, a new national army based on the peasantry was formed.  When the samurai rose in revolt against the reform government and attempted to restore their traditional privileges. the national army defeated them.    The Last Samurai fails as both movie and history.  Avoid it like the plague.   
 Has anyone looking at this book noticed that for the Cancer sign, which, to the best of my knowledge its symbol is a CRAB, that in the book it's a  LOBSTER!   I mean, come on!  Who edited this book?  That just threw me  right off. Maybe it is just the St.Martins Press copy I picked up?  Don't  know. But it certainly hasn't leant any credibility. If this author was  alive today, I am sure she would be livid. Very silly 
 Wendy Doniger, the "translator," of Manu calls the book "evil". Well, you won't confuse her as a cultural or moral relativist. She is quite happy to call attention to 'backwards' India from her Judeo-Christian ivory tower. Only buy this "translation" is you would also consider being taught Torah by an anti-semite. 
 I bought a copy of this book and it IS forcing me to give greater attention to an arguably important part of handicapping, therefore, it might be worth the money.  While Klein's percentage of winners and return-on-investment calculations are adequate for the leaders at the first call, they are without merit for those that do not lead because he dumps both categories in together. This statistical error causes a disparity, but it only "seems" that the ROI between leaders and non-leaders looks larger. But, sheesh, there is only ONE leader but SEVERAL non-leaders. Using basic math, if the win percentage for leaders in a certain category is 30% then the win percentage for non-leaders is 70%.   Using Steve's calculation method, in an 8-horse race you would bet $2 on the leader and $14 (the "non-leaders" times 2)on the non-leaders. Even if a non-leader won there would still be six losers among the non-leaders so the "win percentage" is just 14 percent. Unless the winner pays off at more than 6-1 odds it's a NEGATIVE return-on-investment!  In my opinion, look to other handicapping books for a better return on investment 
 i have read a number of dylan books. i found this one the most difficult to get into and appreciate. i tried to read it a couple of times but gave up. it seemed too complex and high-falluten [?sp].  maybe it's me. anyway, for what it's worth i truly loved CHIMES OF FREEDOM, DYLAN AND PHILOSOPHY AND CHRONICLES 1. GOD BLESS 
 The quality of this isnt great- the sound of the "waterproof" material is loud.  I dont like the side material and think it will fall apart easily.  I would save your money and buy the more expensive one that has better quality.  
 This is one of the most horribly muddled "thrillers" I've ever read.  By the end, I wasn't sure who was "winning" or "losing," nor did I really care.  Clive better quit sub-contracting out his writing.  He should dump this cast of characters and concentrate on Dirk Pitt.  
  Buyer Beware! I waited 2 months for this and it's not the same book represented in the picture. The book I received is entitled "Extreme Muscle Cars: The Factory Lightweight Legacy" and the cover shows a 60's Plymouth dubbed "Honkin' Hemi". It's mostly "lightweight" drag cars. I never would have purchased this version of the book had it been represented on Amazon 
 Not only is this a bad representation of AC/DC Live, (They only opened up with Riff Raff during the brief POWERAGE tour and who cares about Rock N Roll Damnation, live anyway), but this is a fake live album. Judging by many of the alternate live recordings available, AC/DC just never sounded like this live, its all doctored up, the crowd noise is fake (listen to the "Fweep" of the tape machine being turned off at the end of "Whole Lotta Rosie", a glaring mistake and proof of the fakiness. Not a horrible album, Hell aint a bad place and problem child are pretty good, but where is Live Wire? Rocker was'nt available yet in the USA either which just makes it all the more confusing. Proof that Bon Scott Ac/Dc album can .... PS: Let there be Rock and FLick of the switch are the best Ac/DC albums.. 
 Here me out:  maybe it is b/c of the book I just finished (the 3rd policeman) that made me edgy for a little more cohesiveness - a novel if you will.  This book is all in the title:  FRAGMENTS.  Its a uniquely presented book that discusses verbs and actions that we find in 'love'.  From what I did manage to read, it was an eye opener, but I just couldn't get past the way it was presented.  He took several famous authors and took from their works and his life experience and manifested these chapters on the chosen word (chpt one is 'engulf').  I felt like I was reading a REFERENCE book for a poetry class.  Good luck 
 Paulo Coelhho is one of the greatest writers of our time but he failed on this one and I wonder why, commercialism?  Good read, but very disappointing conclusion that contradicts the entire story of what he aims to be plus an arrogant person that he states to dispel in this book, contradictions over. I am waiting for his next novel that will re-institute him as the best ...  Alas don't buy this book, borrow it from the library and read it in your spare time, better entertainment watching Carnaval or Rome on HBO 
 I read the stock reviews and then the readers' reviews and could not agree more with Mr. Hauer's reaction.  I cannot understand how anyone who reads very much could tolerate this poorly written book.  Undoubtedly, Mr. Thomson is a font of knowledge on film history, but he needs a writing class badly.  I threw the book down at p. 181.  Try this on for size:  "No doubt, esteemed Renaissance painters and eighteenth century composers were able to carry on their work without distraction.  (All they had to worry about was Inquisition, plague, or sheer loss of favor.)"  The book is full of bizarre, inaccurate rumblings like this - - and that's before you figure out what in the world this weird aside has to do with the history of American film.  A good editor would have advised the author to reduce his dependence on convoluted sentence structure, entertain simple declarative sentences and reduce this mess to a meaty magazine article at best 
 I purchased six of these chairs in August for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting.  They were all made by this manufacturer (North Pole) and had different NFL logos on them (I only bought one through Amazon, the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues).  At the first game of the season, my chair (Steelers) broke.  At the second game of the season, two more chairs (Bengals and Broncos) broke.  They were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded.  They all broke in the same exact place; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked.  Therefore, 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours.  Needless to say, at $25-$30 each I would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere 
 The plane does not fly very good. When you crash the plane it is so heavy that it breaks the nose off  the tail section and the mid section. Not a very good design 
 This is not one of the better entries to this series. After successfully balancing an intriguing mystery with an important wedding in "Rituals of the Season" it is disappointing to have this story be such a mismash. In this book, readers are finally introduced to Dwight's ex-wife and his son, Cal, but there is no development of either as characters. This is such a strong point to Maron's writing--evocative descriptions of people and places--that it disconcerting to put down this book and not feel like I have just been on a trip to North Carolina (or Virginia.) The characters are flat and unlikeable, the "mystery(s)" are odd and the plot just isn't there.  Still, any Margaret Maron/Deborah Knot mystery is better than none, and the actions in this story will have an impact on Deborah and Dwight's future, but don't read this expecting a thrilling or clever mystery; read it as a segue to the next book in the series 
 My husband and I just bought this toy for my daughter today. She loved her cousin's 'similar' toy (different brand), but we thought this product was cuter, although more expensive. Well after 20 minutes of play, we decided that it needed to go back for several reasons: 1. The wheels are very cheaply made and do not turn (her cousin's cart turned like a real cart). 2. The basket is way too small. 3. The basket comes off too easily. 4. The cardboard boxes are obviously silly and wouldn't last a minute if we had given them to her, but the cuteness of the other food items outweighed this negative point for us.  Due to numbers 1 and 3 above, my daughter became easily frustrated with the cart not turning. But being a good sport, she moved around to the other side trying to turn it that way, but then of course the basket (which almost falls off anyway), gives way and she fell flat on her face. Shame on us for choosing "cute" over sturdy! Beware - this product may be unsafe. We're taking it back today and exchanging it for the same one her cousin had at 1/3 of the price -  we already know it will turn, the basket is large, and it won't fall apart!  
 I bought this book with more expectation than what I got when I received it in the mail.  I needed to fix the slow bootup of Windows XP and there is hardly anything mentioned in this book about it.  The negative tone of voice and his opinon of how to do things in XP do not help the book either.  He seems to not like Microsoft products very well so he critizes how they made Windows XP with extra effects, just for marketing purposes when they are quite interesting to me and I'm sure others too.  The spelling errors aren't too good either and it shows how little time he put into proof reading it before it was published, thus showing how little he cared.  His knowledge is questionable now too since he is careless on the spelling mistakes and grammar errors too.  I knew I should have bought the Microsoft Windows XP Inside/Out.  I recommend that over this lousy book which is of not much help for people who know a lot about computers 
 I order this item becasue it was cheap .49 cheap and paind about $3.45 in shipping. Well this seller must be using AMazon as a con because they never sent the book and pocted the $4.00. Watch out 
 When this book was first issued back in 1979, the information was contemporary and useful. Unfortunatley for this book, the world of Ford performance has changed drastically in the last twenty years. I have the  original print of this book and was looking forward to this update. Boy was  I disappointed. The cover says, "Includes all Modern Ford Performance  Engines." I guess this means anything built after the flathead. The  engine building techniques are old, the technology is old, even the part  numbers are old.  No information on the vast array of the new aftermarket  aluminum heads and manifolds, fuel injection, ignition systems, etc. or  anything on the new Modular engines is offered. If you want a nostalgic  look at what it used to be like or general information on older hot rod  Ford engines, this book may be for you. If you have the first printing of  this book or are trying to build a cutting-edge modern Ford engine, forget  it 
 My son opened this and made a couple of stickers which he was thrilled with until the tape messed up and there are NO instructions on how to reload it!  I did not see the toy out of the box before it jammed up and when I tried to figure it out all I did was ruin more and more sticky tape.  I would NOT recommend this toy unless the company is more helpful with how the product should be put together.  Too bad...good concept 
 Boring, outdated ex-patriate story of life in Paris between the wars, focusing on a young American actress, a psychologist Dr. Diver and his wife, an American baroness with issues.  Lots of drinking and gossip 
 When it is all said and done about Clinton's Legacy, Gene Lyons has assured himself a place in the Presidential Library by writing such a book. The book does point out several areas that Clinton haters seldom want to  see or believe. For example, regardless how you feel about Bill, you must  admire his ability to not only survive a sad, sordid and disadvantage  childhood but achieved his goals in education, public service and politics.  He did so on his own initiative, using and abusing close friends who also  did the same to him, and focusing on saying anything at anytime that could  help him at that time. Whitewater was a shady inside financial political  deal, made among many politicians with profiteers when the Saving and Loan  sector was deregulated, not just in Arkansas but throughout the country. It  was denied during the campaign and avoided by a phony accounting report  that was needed in the primaries, but proved to be less than accurate after  Clinton was elected president. On one hand, two of Clinton's friends became  upset when the deal went south and felt Clinton abandoned them when he  became president. Now did those friends feel betrayed by Clinton and wanted  to bring him down as the book points out? The author has made a great case  saying so and I believe him. On the other hand, was it the silence of  others who refused to answer pivotal questions whether such meetings with  Clinton took place? This would lead back to the president when he was a  governor and would show he plotted and scheme with them? No doubt about it,  their silence saved this president. Therefore, in the book Gene Lyons wants  us to believe the former but some facts clearly show an investigation was  needed and reported properly by the media contrary to the author's  CONclusions. Either way, 17 convictions including the Solicitor General's  convictions are facts not fiction. The author has been trying to apologize  and justify Clinton's behavior since the impeachment. In the end, no book  using revisionists history is going to exonerate this president's actions  prior to and during the first four years of his presidency that  accomplished more than people expected. At the same time, no book can  change the fact that president Clinton was able to avoid impeachment for  many acts that even his party said can be punishable after these last four  years of absolutely few accomplishments whatsoever. No friend or enemy of  the Clintons' have been able to help or hurt the Clintons' more so than  themselves as well as this book that lives off of a public's poor memory.  The only problem is, when you view the Clinton presidency even after  Whitewater, it is one few can be proud of and the only fool is the one who  claims it had made up scandals to bring them down. Sorry, they did it all  by themselves and still are doing it, to the dismay of the many who support  them, and frustration of those would destroy them. The book is worth  reading to provide an overall view of the Clintons' but it can't change  history 
 I've read this book and the previous version. While none of the advice is wrong or bad, I didn't feel like any of it was earth-shattering, either. Most of what's in here is common sense to someone who has a decent shot of getting into a top business school. It's a catchy title, and you may pick up a few tidibits, but I've found other books to be more useful. Also, this version is longer than the previous one, but the additional content doesn't seem to justify the high price 
 Published in the early 1990s, this book puts forth the thesis that the end of the Cold War, and its victory by the US, marked a significant turning point in history.  Specifically, mankind can see the light at the end of the tunnel of history, that the liberal democracy that is America at the end of the Cold War is pretty close to a perfect society and once every society reaches this stage, mankind has reached the end of history.  No more wars, no more revolutions, no more upheavals, etc, etc.  Of course, events in the next decade up to and after the 9-11/2001 terrorist attacks proved this book all wrong.  Mankind is nowhere near the end of history; in fact we might be staring at a very long war between established governments and multinational terrorist groups.  And the dot.com bust, the Enron and related scandals, and now the economic and social wreckage due to a summer's worth of hurricanes shows that liberal democracies like the US are not even close to being optimal societies in terms of managing people - people or people - nature relationships.  I believe this book is even more foolish; that its thesis and its premise was flawed even in 1993, and that the author should have known better than to publish such bullcrap.    First, the human population continues to grow.  Yet the amount of arable land and drinkable water is not increasing.  This can only lead to conflicts.  It led to conflicts in the past, and will only lead to more conflicts in the future.  We are seeing it happen already; every year the SW states in the USA duke it out in courts over water access.  Every year the Jews and Palestinians in Israel bicker over water access.  And of course we have at least one war per decade over oil; whether it be in the Middle East or somewhere else.  As the world's population grows, we are only going to have more wars, and since wars make great history, a lot more history to go thru.  Second, the author's premise that America is a liberal democracy is totally false.  America is a corporate democracy.  Pull over 100 people on any American city street (D.C. excepted) and ask them who their congressmen is, or who their state representative is, or even who their mayor is, and after a slight pause, the most common answer would be "I DO NOT KNOW".  On the other hand, ask him/her how their 401K is doing, or how is their mutual fund performing, and you will get a certain answer.  This discrepancy of awareness and involvement between civic society and the corporate world can only mean one thing; America is a corporate democracy.  An even more potent sign; many of the prisons, schools, and health care facilities in the US are increasingly run in part or in whole by corporations.  Three of the most fundamental aspects of any society; criminal punishment, health care, and education, are run by corporations in the US.  Third, democracies don't always last.  A Roman Republic over 300 years old converted to dictatorship in under a century.  The area that is now Poland was comprised of democratic states throughout the Middle Ages.  These were successively conquered by their bigger neighbors (France, Germany, Russia) and subjected to dictatorships.  The Native American tribes throughout the N. American continent were all democracies in the purest sense of the word.  From 1776 - 1910, each and every single one of them was either destroyed, displaced, or absorbed by one nation that only allowed white males to rule; the USA.  Last, in any given time period, the democratic nations that exist are usually expanding their possessions, usually be conquering less democratic nations.  Semi-democratic, aristocratic England conquered the Middle East and India.  Democratic France conquered N. Africa.  And of course the US has defeated or taken over various countries such as Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Spain and the Philippines, all of which were less democratic than the US.  Democracy does not put an end to man's greed, it only channels it outwards towards its neighbors near and far.  All in all, a book of false conclusions based on false premises.  It is worthy of reading if only to see the mistakes in its logic and arguments 
 It is a wonder this book sells even now when lot of better books have gone out of print. Then, life is full of such surprises 
 The book was written before the peso devaluation and subsequent crisis and is utterly useless unless you need a paperweight.  This 3rd Edition is dated March 2002, and all hotel and restaurant pricing is from pre-devaluation. I spent November 2004 in Buenoes Aires and am headed back January 19, 2005.  Buy Time Out Buenos Aires instead: Second Edition 2004.  It is perfect 
 I thought that perhaps I was losing my hearing.  I looked (in vain) for subtitles to see if that would help.  My partner assured me that no, my hearing was fine, the audio on these DVD's is woeful.  Then I started to have episodes of deja vu.  Or maybe jkust episodes that were on The Complete Season One were included in this.  Huh?  Very strange.  I won't buy again until they do something about the audio.  It is headache enducing 
 Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn. No other ballet partnership is as legendary -- the fiery Russian defector and the graceful, aging English ballerina formed a bond on and off the stage that for several years practically defined romantic ballet. Thus, for this very reason, hardcore balletomanes should get this dvd. Many of us (including me) were too young to have seen Nureyev and Fonteyn live, so these videos are the only example to dissect the legendary partnership.  However, caveat emptor: this is NOT a "typical" Swan Lake by any means. You can argue that there is no "typical" Swan Lake -- the original production in 1877 was a failure. Some of the music went missing. After Tchaikovksy's death, the choreographers Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov restaged Swan Lake, and that version more or less is the Swan Lake audiences know today. There's lots of music, so most versions of Swan Lake use the "traditional" pieces.   Nevertheless, there are some different traditions of Swan Lake. In the Russian productions, the outcome is usually "happy" -- Rothbart is killed, and Siegfried and Odette are alive. In the productions used "everywhere else," Odette and Siegfried leap into the lake, and are reunited in the otherworld. I prefer the second ending personally, because I think it better matches both the story (the happy ending was enforced by the Tsar, and seems tacked on), and the music as well.  Rudolf Nureyev's 1966 film, however, is unlike any other Swan Lake I've ever seen. First of all, from the opening closeup (of Siegfried in blue eyeshadow and red lipstick) you realize this film is not going to follow Balanchine (and classical ballet's) creed of "ballet is woman." The first act is redesigned to incorporate a lot of solos and dance opportunities for Siegfried (Nureyev). The first act usually ends with Siegfried picking up his bow and arrow and going hunting with Benno. In this film, there is a long elegiac solo for Siegfried (using music that's usually used in act 2).   Nureyev even dares to tinker with the famous Act II choreography by Lev Ivanov. In the famous Odette/Siegfried Adagio, the melody is not repeated with the cello -- instead, there's another solo for Siegfried. Margot Fonteyn was born in 1919 so it's possible that the emphasis on Nureyev is due to Fonteyn's technical limitations at the time. And one notices that Fonteyn, as graceful and lovely as she is, is at times unable to cope with the famously demanding Odette/Odile role. For instance, Odette's solo in Act II usually ends with a series of turns and then Odette stands on pointe and holds a balance before going into the wings. Fonteyn doesn't attempt the feat, but ends the series of turns in first position -- flat on her feet. Fonteyn by modern standards also lacks the athleticism, bonelessness (her arms always look like arms, not wings), flamboyance, and flexibility, that one usually associates with this role.  Act III's music choreography is pretty standard, but the musical arrangements (and choreography) for the Black Swan Pas de deux are radically different. Fonteyn actually churns out the fouettes, confirming something I've long suspected: that everyone looks at the fouettes, but Odette/Odile's real challenges are the balances, footwork, and leaps, and this is where you can see Fonteyn suffer.   Strangely, Act IV (the act that is usually cut to shreds) is the most intact. And it's the best-danced act: it;s the reconciliation scene between Odette and Siegfried that one can catch glimmers of the genuine bond that existed between these dancers. Elsewhere, the technical limitations of Fonteyn by this time and Nureyev's reworking of Swan Lake as a solo showpiece for Siegfried distracted me from simply enjoying their partnership. I particularly loved when Siegfried runs all over the stage, turning up the head of each swan, to find his Odette, and when he finally finds Margot's head, it's a truly beautiful moment. The ending of Nureyev's version follows the original Swan Lake, and not the "usual" endings of the Swan Boat to heaven.  On a technical level, there are problems. The ballet was filmed on a soundstage, and seems way too small to fit a whole cpmpany corps. As a result, the dancers often look haplessly cramped and as if they'll bump into each other. The close bunching also detracted from the natural geometric shapes that are so much a part of classical ballet. The Vienna State Ballet also looks woefully underreheased. Either that or they're just bad. Their legs are terribly uneven in arabesques, their arms are a mess, and they simply look like a corps that hasnt danced Swan Lake enough. The sets are also deliberately artificial and the costuming, espeically for Nureyev and in the "color" acts, is garish. Rothbart (Redbeard here) is a non-dancing role, unlike in most productions when he's a smooth pimp-type in Act III.   For a traditional Swan Lake with a more modern Odette/Odile, I'd suggest the Makarova/Dowell dvd with the Royal Ballet. Makarova was 41 at the time of filming, but her long extensions, boneless arms, exquisite balances, and still impressive technique make her Odette/Odile much more appealing to modern tastes. This Swan Lake is of great historical value, and Fonteyn is undeniably lovely, but overall I admit I wanted a more traditional Swan Lake, and I certainly wouldnt recommend this dvd as anyone's first Swan Lake. Its just too unorthodox.  
 Ask yourself before you buy this book: would you want your daughter, sister, or mother selling her body to tourists and contracting deadly STDs while doing so? Probably not. 
 I was quite disappointed by "Sassanian Elite Cavalry". It did not seem to be up the normal standard of excellency of Osprey's books. The color plates by Angus McBride did not look as polished or as detailed as the usual works by this artist (especially plate E : it ressembles a sketch more than a finished painting).  Moreover, some of the plates' descriptions do not quite match the paintings (for example D5 and D6 :  the description talks about a quiver and a sword not visible on the plate).  The text suffered from the lack of a good and much-needed map of the Sassanian Empire, and a glossary of Persian technical words (for instance plate A caption talks about  a "sardar" without an explanation anywhere in the text). The plates show five women, including at least two warriors, and readers may have liked to know more about the place of women in the Sassanian society and army.  Also, the black and white illustrations do not well support the text. One exemple : the author speaks several times about the similarities between Sassanian costumes and certain modern Iranian traditional clothes. A few pictures of the later would be of more help to the reader than too many, slightly blurry, photos of stone carvings. I also wonder why there is only height color plates in this Elite series book instead of the usual twelve 
 A rambling, boring plot; major characters that aren't remotely plausible; potentially interesting characters that make a brief appearance only to be killed off; major plot elements that aren't really resolved - all this and more in what must be one of the most poorly written books I've read in the last decade.  Don't waste your time on this stinker 
 It's fragmented and feels like it doesn't know whether it wants to be funny or serious, but I could have lived with that if it hadn't been so scarily oblivious and unpleasant. One example: "And I'm secretly thrilled that I might actually be starting a friendship with someone as cool--and as black--as Angie."  Oh, great. Because black people just LOVE that. I mean, how cool is that? Rich white lady wants to be my friend because I'm black! Groovy! I love to be an accessory! She doesn't have to feel like she's a self-centered, useless rich boob anymore, because she's different! She has a black friend! And a gay one! How rebellious!   And don't get me started on how she fancies herself some wild-and-crazy partier but still thinks oral sex is "taboo" and "antifeminist" and that any guy who wants to do a woman up the butt is necessarily gay.   Who is this book for? Not for black people, gay people, non-rich people, or any woman who has ever enjoyed any kind of sex beyond the standard missionary type. In other words, it's for Dr. Laura, and that's about it 
 Ok I havent even read this book yet and I am sort of afraid to spend my money and be left dissappointed. Mainly because I've read Death before Dishoner by 50 and Nikki Turner and that one was awful plus the reviews on this book is so bad as well. 50 need to find something else to do because if he keeps this up he is going ruin alot of talented authors careers! 
 In this cleverly titled book by veteran archaeologist William Dever, we are presented with a novel theory for Israelite origins.  Dever spends the first two thirds of his work on building up the introduction.  This isn't necessarily bad, if the payoff is big at the end.  Indeed, he surveys many of the most important sites around Canaan, introducing us to the history and culture of this region and different schools of thought regarding Israelite origins before progressing to a solid and sustained critique of Finkelstein's nomad-sedentarization model.  The problem with the book, however, begins with the final third, where Dever enthusiastically describes his theory, which basically holds that the "proto-Israelites" were in fact sedentarized Canaanites who fled to the hill-country in the wake of the general late-Bronze Age collapse.  Although the first part of the book, which served as the build-up, consisted of discussions of archaeological sites and critiques based on lack of evidence, Dever introduces his theory (which takes up a measly eleven pages) with an up-front admission that it also lacks evidence!  "My theory, is speculative, of course; and like Medelhall's and Gottwald's peasant revolt it has little direct archaeological evidence to support it." (179) "Nevetheless," Dever assures us, "this scenario is quite realistic". (ibid)  Thanks!  Now one has to wade through the rest of his discussion knowing in advance that it lacks evidence.  But wait a minute, didn't Dever just spend a hundred pages attacking other archaeologists because their theories lacked evidence?  One can buy into his theory or not, that's not the point.  It's more about how little we really know about the origins of Israel outside the biblical record, which when rejected, creates a vacuum that can be filled with any "realistic" and "scholarly" sounding theory.  If you buy this book, use it for the archaeological survey and critique of Finkelstein.  Just remember to continue Dever's critique onto himself! 
 the tea kettle has a nice shape and the whistle works fine, but the inside of the spout began to rust within the first month. 
 The Fiestaware Scarlet mugs are beautiful but dangerous.  The handle is much too small for this size mug.  If you can get your finger through the small hole, your finger will soon be as scarlet as the Fiestaware.  The first and only time my family used these mugs, two of us burned ourselves.    Fiestaware really screwed up on this one, a shame given the beauty of the Scarlet Fiestaware 
 Disappointing:- very bad quality reproductions of Wllies drawings and photographs,they are blured and lose much of the detail. Many amateur drawings clearly not by Willie.Only good pics. are on the cover 
 First off, I am a fan of the original series - Escaflowne. It's by far up there in the top 5 of favorite anime. It had a lot of memorable characters, good action and a pretty decent story.  This is not an original Escaflowne. It does not take part before or after the series. It doesn't take place somewhere in the middle. It takes most of the main characters from the series and totally retells the entire story to fit into a movie. The result? Not a fan. Basically, because the entire movie you see a 30 second introduction to old characters in suped up animation with no depth. For example, the twin cat girls that were so fond Lord Falcon, show up instead for a brief 30 seconds as singers on stage in a bar. Ummm yuck. Lots of the more memorable characters are subjugated to this. Perhaps, if you seen this first it would be a decent watch. For myself, I was very disappointed.  The good points of this movie is the animation is upgraded and the soundtrack is well done.  Even as a standalone product, the movie has no flow or depth to it. It's basically just a compressed retelling of Escaflowne. I'd rent this and skip it as a purchase. If you want to purchase something, get the Escaflowne series. You will be much happier 
 I received this 2CD set in the mail and was horrified at the sound quality of the so called "mastering".  I have original un-mastered copies of some REO Speedwagon albums that sound BETTER than this set!  I love REO to death and the track listing is good to go, but in all honesty, this compilation falls flat on its face in regards to sound quality.  The band seriously needs to find a good remasterer and give the fans what they have been waiting for.  I cannot recommend any previous greatest hits releases that even come close.  Save your money and wait 
 This book does not do a good job of getting the small experiments running. And w/o that, it is difficult to get any handle over the big picture. If you haven't done XML and Oracle integration before, this book definitely is not what you are looking for. 
 Conclusions that Richard Lynn draws from the data should be valid if and only if he could explain the historical facts and not only the extant situation.  His ahistorical approach is exemplary. While he explicitely conducts evolutionary analysis of the humankind he surprisingly forgets to connect his IQ data with historical facts such as:  that the first great civilisations emerged in the Near East and Northern Africa not in Northern, Central or Eastern Europe; the first European civilizations connected with metalurgy (the Asia Minor and the Balkan Complex), rational thought (elaborate philosophy and mathematical theoremes) emerged in Asia Minor and SouthEast Europe, not in Northern or Central Europe. Northern and Central Europe started to emerge in the history of civilisation only at the end of the middle ages and was enlightened by the Arab translations of the ancient Greek thought. This explanatory paradox substantially weakens Lynn's general conclusions on the direct connection between geography and general cognitive abilities. This is also valid for the conclusions in his book on IQ and the wealth of the countries. His ahistorical explanations are astonishing in negative sense.  For example, the higher IQ scores of Northern Europeans compared to the Southeast Europeans could be a result of the very well documented South to North migratory flow during the last 5-6 centuries of Turkish Ottoman suppression in Southeast Europe. Many highly intelligent people even today leave Southeast Europe and migrate to USA or Western Europe for better life. This is an every day fact. Thus, it is not only the cold winters that concentrate clever people in some geographical regions in some periods of time. The real high resolution picture of the IQ-Race-Geography dynamics is probably much more complex and intricate than Lynn is ready to admit. His explanations, thus, can be treated only as zero (or at most) first approximation acceptable on the general geographic scale. Much more subtle historical analyses are needed on lower geographic scales to make his explanations meaningful 
 Unless you really want a tiny, cheap version of one of the most important books ever written, you should do yourself a favor and get a different edition.  This one is an embarrassment.    Almost any of the other editions (except for the miniature edition that also sells for $4.95) is a much better choice than this turkey.  If you are going to take the time to read an English translation of a 2,500 year old Chinese classic, you really should do yourself a favor and get a better edition 
 Leonard Maltin put this book out too soon. It seems like a rush job.There are hundreds of films repeated from his classic and, what is worse, there are hundreds of available films that he skips. Many films on TCM this month (April) where missing. The book is needed but it needs more work to fill the void. It should be reworked totally as it is really needed 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 Here is the first few lines of the chapter beginning on page 162:  Play is tactile...       Play is revealing... Play is active...        Play is cultural... Play is experimental...  Play is knowledge... Play is imaginative...   Play is curious...  In fact the entire chapter is 2 pages long consisting only of stuff like this.  The rest of the book is slightly better.  If you like this kind of stuff then buy it.  If you prefer something interesting to read and useful, I would recommend spending about the same amount of money on The Power of Simplicity 
 This book is a decent introduction to Direct3D graphics, but it's by no means a definitive guide, nor is it a guide to Direct3D9 graphics. A discussion of the real meat and potatoes of Direct3D9, the facet that makes the API so exciting for developers, pixel and vertex shaders, is completely omitted. So it's essentially a Direct3D7 level text.   The discussion of 3D mathematics was abysmal, a lot of the actual math isn't really shown, but how to use the D3DX helper functions are. Worst of all, Thorn didn't show us how to multiply matrices -- LUDICROUS! If anyone wants to be a professional graphics programmer, implementing and developing new algorithms, they're going to need to get to grips with the, sometimes grueling, mathematics.    The discussion of 3D concepts is okay, but it's all extremely basic. I was able to get a very simple, fixed-function game engine running using this book as a reference for some of the API functions, but if you want to make more cutting edge graphics programs, you need pixel shaders to do that.   If you can get this book used and dirt cheap, then it'll be a decent intro to Direct3D, but I suggest you pick up either Wolfgang Engel's Beginning Direct3D Game Programming and/or Frank Luna's book -- both of which introduce pixel/vertex shaders.   After you read the forementioned, "Programming Vertex And Pixel Shaders" by Wolfgang Engel will be most useful, as well as the ShaderX series (also edited by Engel). 
 Greene just can't seem to get to the point.  Any point.  But she does take a long time not getting there.  More than any author I have encountered, Greene seems to think that one should never use one or two words when a dozen or two will do the same job.   I spent more time rereading Greene's sentences than any other book I can remember with little to show for it.   Apparently, Greene feels that filling her book with long rambling quotes, endless lists of examples, arcane terminology, unnecessary adjectives, and run on sentences gives it some gravitas.   While it does make it difficult to understand, that doesn't mean that the underlying ideas are deep, just that they are obscured by poor writing.  
 The SD slot stopped working last night - very frustrating. The compact flash card slot still works, though. I noticed a reviewer mentioned that it didn't work with their 4GB SD card. It did work with my Transcend 150x 4GB SD card. 
 This performance has Vai and Satch burning up like we all know they do. Mr. Malmstien can wail all over the fretboard like a mad man but it would be nice if he would actually compose some music. Arpegios and blazing neck length scales are impressive but tiresome after all of 2 minutes. The "Live in Concert" DVD (filmed in Mineapolis) with Erik Johnson is WAYYYYYY better in every way. Vai, Satch and Johnson have a chemestry that just works. The songs played by Satch and Vai are better on the Johnson concert and they are each in absolute top form in every set. The last set with all 3 maistros is blues/rock oriented and is so well done! I was absolutely amazed how well Satch and Vai incorporated thier unique playing to more traditional blues/rock covers. Malmstein is an ego-maniac who was an uncomfortable ingredient in an other wise fairly good mix. Smashing his guitar to pieces might have entertained us when we were all teenagers... not today 
 This is a book about Emotional Intelligence which does not consider the reader's emotions. It's very insipid and lacks the depth. If you have already read the Emotional Intelligence by the same author, I wouldn't suggest this book 
 To endure life's inevitable roadblocks, we have to strive not for perfection, but contentment, and miraculously all the pain will go away -- for a while.  What he calls "curing" I call "coping with."  There is no cure for the hardships we all encounter along the way -- becoming a hermit is even worse, as you dwell on what's wrong.  Ultimately, all pain goes through a "receiving center" in the brain, and seratonin blocks the perception of pain and keeps it from "centralizing" in the nervous system.  In his diatribute to the ability to be pain-free, he refers a lot to his former book, BRAIN LONGEVITY, on which he collaborated with the same journalist who has written for several medical magazines.  He uses many "deficits" for possible causes of chronic pain, but specifically names seratonin as the worst, depending on one's pain tolerance threshold.  He says that women suffer more from chronic pain due to hormonal changes, that two-thirds of all patients at pain clinics are women with migraines.  Back pain is three times more prevelant in women, according to this doctor, and chronic muscle pain is ten times more common among the female sex.  All pain signals ultimately land in the brain, where they trigger thought, emotions, memories, and a complex array of biochemical events aimed at protecting your body from further harm.  With chronic pain, the alarm continues to shriek uselessly long after the physical danger has passed.   Seratonin is the body's single best pain-fighter, more important even than endorphins.  Seratonin deficit is a major culprit.  He emphasizes that suffering is one reaction to pain, but not the only possible reaction -- that it is possible to experience pain without suffering from it.  He admits that all lives contain some pain but, when you can experience it without suffering, "your chronic, disabling pain, for all practical purposes will be 'cured'."  Pain is the most common reason people go to doctors.  Dr. Scott Fishman, president of the American Academy of Pain Management feels, "We've wandered from the basic philosophy in medicine, where you cure what you can but always treat suffering, to being focused only on curing."  In the section about arthritis, he confirms that the side effects pain medications present are worse than the problem they are supposed to relieve.  One example is plain aspirin which, he says destroys the cartilage, the "padding" which keeps bones from rubbing together.  This is the most common type called osteoarthritis.  It is thought that eighty percent have this type by the age of fifty, progressing as age does.  It involves hands, spine, hips, knees and feet (primarily in overweight people), and goes back to the cavemen.  Exercise therapy is touted as a natural substitute for medicine, but I know first hand that this type can cause more pain.  Rheumatoid is a disorder or malfunction of the immune system with more inflammation of the joints.  He says that this is most often in women between 25 and 50, with no known cure.  In this type, you have to learn to "conquer" as opposed to "cure."  He really only stresses what we all know, you just have to live with pain at varying times and in varying intensities.  If you try to follow all of his suggestions, not only would you spend all your time trying to locate and consume numerous herbal supplements and expensive foods, but your money, too.  Mort Crim once remarked, "forgiving someone can't change the past but it can transform the future."  Dr. Khalsa tried out this intensive program at the University of Arizona. I think he must have had all female subjects. It is not recommended to use this as a substitute for medical care, as needed, only as some suppositions.  More research is needed, I feel, and I wonder how long his program lasted.  I feel that traditional Pain Management, similar to what I had at Vanderbilt in Nashville is better -- but there is NO cure for pain.  That's an illusion 
 I'm glad I found this book in the library and didn't buy it! After hearing the good reviews here I was shocked at how poor this book really was. I'm a fan of the paranormal and have studied it for a long time, I am always looking for new views and info whether it be pro or con. But this book is obviously a debunking manuscript. And a poor one at that! It tackles only the weakest of cases, ignores REAL evidence, and brings forth "rational" explanations that are even more far out than the paranormal explanation. The section on crop circles was horrible, dismissing it as a hoax without even LOOKING AT ANY of the fascinating evidence that this is a real occurance. Pass 
 Living in Washington, DC and seeing the changes in demographics in the city and surrounding area made me pick up this book at a sidewalk sale for 50 cents to see what Wilson's take on the "new urban poor" and his research correlating them to the loss of work opportunities. Reading this book should be mandatory at an advanced statistics course of how to come to bad conclusions through the use of selective and wrong data.  DC has never had a big industrial base, but it had a very strong and influential black middle class early in the 20th century up until FDR's New Deal when the city was swamped with undereducated and socially dysfunctional immigrants from the southern states. It is the same time that DC became a "black majority" city. This is the same time frame that Wilson uses to "prove" that there was a direct correlation with the loss of factory jobs and the explosion of the urban poor. In order to come to this conclusion, Wilson uses a lot of statistics taken out of context, manipulated to support his conclusions, and then come up with a rehash of "new" policy initiatives which are essentially a regurgitation of LBJ's "war on poverty" programs, which were an expansion and rehash of FDR's "New Deal." What Wilson ignores are demographic shifts and trends that are much more easily explained and much more solidly supported by Charles Murray, Marvin Olasky, and others who were much more thorough in examining the trends that Wilson writes about.  The Washington DC area today has more jobs than ever before, yet the illegitimacy rate for black children is 90%. In the 1920's and 30's, the illegitimacy rate for whites and blacks was the same, even during the height of segregation and discrimination. The city now has a population base 25% smaller than its peak in the 50's. Even though job opportunities were expanding for minorities in DC, the black middle class abandoned DC and moved into Prince Georges County to get away from crime and other deteriorating social norms, but none of this is to be found in Wilson's research. The same is true for other cities where a combination of "white flight" and "black flight" of the middle class made these downtowns more closely resemble cities in third world countries than the USA. Similar problems can be found in Paris and its suburbs, and many other cities around Europe where immigration and a lack of assimilation have created huge ghettos of the "Urban Poor." There is indeed a much greater correlation to be found in the expansion of the size of the urban poor with the expansion of government programs designed to eliminate poverty. None of these alternative, and much more persuasive, reasons for the plight of the urban poor are to be found in this book. It was people like Wilson who "proved" Galileo to be wrong when he said that the Earth revolved around the sun, and this book is about as convincing. There are many good statistics and arguments in this book. The problem is that Wilson has excluded any alternative explanations of the reasons for the urban poor, which makes this a very dishonest book.  
 The story started off OK with the first two short chapters.  Then it falls apart.  The template is used but isn't filled out.  The love interest isn't, the bad guys did it but we don't have a clue how the good guys know that.  Getting into the clutches of the bad guys was done by following the script from the (imaginary) Scary Movie series for action fiction.  Getting out of the clutches of the bad guys relied entirely on the stupidity of well-trained mercenaries (who could not have been trained to the level of Scoobie Do if they were really that stupid).  There were a few interesting tidbits on history and historical paraphenalia, glaciers, old planes but the biology was 70's.  A very disappointing read 
 I'm afraid this is going to be the last Mary Balogh book I buy.  It's painful to admit this to myself because, since discovering her novels (my first was No Man's Mistress) and then glomming all her back titles from the last 20 years, I've spent many a happy hour in her Regency romance world.    But Balogh's titles of the past six years--the "Slightly" and "Simply" books--have all disappointed me and Simply Magic is, sadly, the worst of the lot.  I continued to buy and read Balogh, in spite of my disappointment, because I'd hoped she was in a slump from which she'd emerge.  But after reading Simply Magic, I'm giving up that Balogh will ever again write the heart-rending, angsty gems (The Temporary Wife, The Notorious Rake, Heartless, Dancing With Clara, Lord Carew's Bride, et al.) that made her reputation.  Where to begin with what's wrong with this latest effort?  With the uninspiring beta hero (among the most irritating I've ever encountered in the genre) who's unbecomingly dominated by his morally-challenged mama (and who sheepishly admits to the heroine his knees shake when he has to give his steward an order)?  Or the emotionally stunted heroine whose behaviour seems like that of someone clinically depressed throughout most of the story--complete with a sort of disassociation of her mind with her body when it comes to sex?  And then there's Balogh's unfortunate penchant, which has become more and more pronounced in her recent works, to clog the story with so many extraneous characters and tidbits about their lives that the reader feels the need to take notes.  The biggest problem I have with this book, however, is that it reveals Balogh's abandonment of what I believe is THE crucial premise of the romance story.  Balogh spends a great deal of energy on making the point to the reader that the "love story" is not the cake in her heroine's life but the frosting.  In her recent novels she takes pains to show the heroine doesn't require the masculine essence of the hero, in its highest form of romantic love, for her emotional, spiritual and physical completion.  Her recent heroines are emotionally self-sufficient, have employment they love, and while it would be ever so luscious and easy-around-the-manor to be married, it's not a core, primal necessity for their life's fulfillment.    There's always a moment in Balogh's recent books where the hero has this epiphany, when he "gets it" that the heroine will be just fine without him.  The story is not allowed to move on, in fact, until the hero has that bit of feminist-tinged dogma firmly implanted in his head.  I suppose all of us modern types are supposed to nod in agreement but, in a romance novel, I find the whole presentation dreary to the max.  (Can we not escape the death of romantic love anywhere?  Not even in its supposed last bastion, the pastel cover romance novel?)   I read romance novels to experience the archetypal wonder of romantic love between a man and a woman--a love that torments and creates upheavel but also redeems, completes, saves.  Romantic love is full of messy dependency, jealousy, and a lot of shadow--that's what makes it romantic. It gives a vision, a much needed vision, that continues to persist and inspire--and has great power to explain the behaviour of men and women toward each other.  Balogh used to write books that glorified that archetype.  Often employing the stock characters of the genre--the dark, tortured hero, the empathetic, nurturing heroine.  But then she "saw the light" (or something) and her works have devolved over the last several years into neat, passionless feminist samplers that have more than a politically correct whiff to them--and all the depth and complexity of a "Can This Marriage Be Saved?" column--or worse, the Regency equivalent of a Glamour magazine editorial about balancing career and "relationship."   Simply Magic reminds me of a kind of romance prozac.  It calms, tones down, erases and tames the wild beasts of the masculine and feminine romantic archetypes.  I don't want that drug. I want to feel.    
 I work in a bank where every year each of the branches does a stupid secret Santa thing around Christmas time.  I bought this as a gift for the guy I got stuck with.    The thing comes in a nondescript box and looks like a paper clip.  If I had given this as a gift, people would have thought I raided the supply closet at work for a present.  Total garbage 
 I picked up the audio book from the library, and didn't know by the title and author's name (my first Jance book) that this was chick lit. I don't feel this book was something I would've started had I known. It started real well, and Ms. Jance knows how to reel you in with her writing. Midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging  about her unfair release as a new anchor, and then about her friend who died of ALS, and then came the long responses to the blogs. It just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could've been a decent suspense drama. 
 I was disappointed in this book,if I had seen it on a shelf before hand I would have bypassed it all together. Very little information and not enough listing for referrence use. Would not recommend to anyone 
 Here's the news:less than half the forces on the allied side on D Day were from the  U.S. Would you guess that from reading Ambrose's book? - nope. The vast bulk of the volume is devoted to the U.S. experience. It seems Ambrose thinks the British, Canadians etc were just there to make up the numbers.  It's just not acceptable for a historian to devote the bulk of what purports to be an account of that day to one national contingent and then call it 'D Day' . To perpetrate that is petty and appallingly parochial.  Worse: it's offensive to the memories of ALL those who fought and died for democracy. The American sacrifice was real and  doesn't need this sort of thing to keep its memory green.  Robin Neillands and John Keegan have both written much better, fairer accounts.  If Ambrose had called the book 'the American contribution to D-Day' no one could have complained. As it is, it has no claim to our serious consideration as history. 
 It took me 3+ days to get this thing to work with my notebook.  Cannot get it to work with my desktop.  Tech support was no help at all.  They just had me retrying things I already did.  If your not a networking wizard do not buy this router.  Newer models don't need the manual setup of this one 
 I'm amazed at some of the positive reviews. This book was so boring. Probably one of Zahn's worst books, although i havent read all of them yet. To many things going on at once, no real connection to the main story. Which seemed to be the return of Thrawn. And how did it end? With a DUD. Simply horrible. 
 This book of short stories and poems by Edgar Allan poe is very confusing. I would only suggest this book to an adult of teenager with an extremely wide vocabulary. I'm in middle school and I didn't really undrestand some of the stories. If you are into bazzar and weird things then this is the book for you. don't get me wrong Edgar Allan Poe is an awsome writer but the book is a little confusing. Be sure to make the right choice on this book 
 This is a great book to read by the fireplace. After about thirty pages you can conveniently toss it IN the fireplace! This is the most boring, disorganized, pointless book I have ever read. I read it because it was recommended by Stephen King. If you want a good book, I would recommend looking elsewhere 
 A well meaning friend bought me The Grave Maurice in anticipation of my wanting a good read for a summer holiday. It was a grave mistake, not on the part of my friend, but on the part of Miss Grimes. Like one reviewer, I was tempted to lay fault on the editors, but throwing it back over the transom for a complete rewrite (or outright rejection) was probably not an option.   Not being a Martha Grimes fan coming into this read, my beak was well wetted for a good, fast paced, and satisfing read that hinted at topics interesting to me: race horses and the market. The Grave Maurice reads more like a bundle of "notes for future novels" than the final *well crafted* novel I expected. There are a few moments of close focus, but unfortunately these are rewarded with banal conversations, usually about food. What is worse, aside from the over-frequent references to Little Chefs, a debateable but established pinnacle of roadside Englishness, there is nothing quintessentially English about the dialogues and interactions. The characters are intrusive, explain themselves or their actions uninvited, and in short, reflect little reserve and even less depth of personality. For the sake of brevity, I'll forgo comment on the thick handed treatment of the market related bits. Finally, as to the story itself, by page 207 (paperback), I'm still not quite sure which crime will be the one warranting the skills of a Scotland Yard detective. Not a good sign. And not a good sign when I notice myself speed reading just to finish the book "on principle". I'm not worried at all that I'll miss something in this scatter-brained mess.   As an aside, I wouldn't hold the author's American origins at fault, as Deborah Crombie, a mystery writer with Texas origins, more than amply demonstrates authorial skill, refined attentiveness to anglophile atmosphere, and most importantly, editorial craft, in her "English mysteries". If you haven't read Miss Crombie's books, do yourself, or your vacationing friends, a grave favor and head over there instead 
 I understand that one of the main tenets of homeopathy is treating a condition with something that would induce the same illness in a healthy person, but works to heal a sick person.  But you have got to be crazy if you think I'm going to give my toddler arsenic, aconite, a dead mashed-up bee, or many of the other remedies suggested in this book.  It is well organized and contains many herbal remedies that would be easy for most people to find at a health food store or organic grocer, but there were many entries that I wouldn't even begin to know where to look for.  For instance, elements such as mercury and sulphur--should I raid the local high school chemistry lab to cure a sore throat?  Don't think so.  I guess I'm more of your mainstream herbalist 
 This one is a peculiar mix of populist polemic and third rate scientific argument. Deacon's approach to argument is endless repetition and obfuscation with detail. The initial chapters on indexical,iconic and symolic representation and language acquisition are hardly original and here needlessly complicated. Thick knotted prose, sweeping unsupported statements and carelessly "constructed" arguments abound. It is astounding and intensely disappointing to read the gushing uncritical reviews as well. In short, this book is a menace to critical thinking on this subject 
 The contenet of this book was fine -- exactly what a Jackie Collins fan would expect.  However, the ending is so disappointing, it made me angry!  It seems more like cliffhanger than an ending.  To tell you the truth, I'm still half expecting a sequel!  Just when you're getting to the book's climax, IT ENDS!  It is absolutely unnerving!  This may be due to the facts that it was Ms. Collins' first book and was written back in 1968, I don't know.  But I do know that of all the books she's written, this has got to be the worst 
    Diamond spends twenty one laughable pages on male lactation.  What's next?  How about implanting a uterus?  After all, men are stronger and could probably carry babies better.    Big game hunting by the males of indigenous tribes was probably more effective when there was more game.  But, for Diamond, it leaves the question open as to "What are men good for?"      My question is "What is Jared Diamond good for?" 
 it was bad in a way but it got better. It was a cool book with a lot  of things most people would not  think of.Yeah 
 I am a student currently using this book for a course. I have found this book to be, quite literally, the worst textbook I have encountered. Neither author is a native English speaker and this is quite apparent (especially in the way questions at the end of the chapter are phrased). I can read a question and have no idea what the authors are asking me to find (this isn't a matter of not knowing how). To begin most problems, I have to look at the solutions manual to figure out what it is the authors intended to ask me. If you are a professor considering this book, please, please, please think of your students and find a textbook that is easier to understand!  A few other notes: 1. Questions refer to figures, tables and samples are sprinkled throughout the chaper without giving a page number. I have seen other books that give a page number - this is much more friendly. 2. The notation used in the book is not explained and explanations seem to miss critical steps or concepts 
 I looked at the sample pages, and saw fig. 1.2 giving an analysis of a website that didn't clearly identify its overall goals , etc. But the page in question was so obviously one of those 'search network' typo-url cookie-cutter sites of domain squatters. It's not a serious site, and anyone with half a clue in web marketing knows this. So even though I've no idea what the rest of the book says, I doubt the writer's judgment and current state of knowledge. I mean, if he can't spot a squatter spam site, what else is he oblivious to 
 Before all Evanovich fans blast me double barrels, please note: This refers to the audio CD, abridged version of High Five. It was my first J.E. novel & I thought would be the last.  Having read many customer reviews, I might have to try reading one instead of listening.   I found the story to be limp & quite elementary.  Chief problem: the AUDIO CD reader whose lisp is most annoying.  It sounds as though she's auditioning for a part in a high school play...one she won't get.  Or auditioning for the role of "Thindy" Brady of Brady Bunch fame...a part she's destined to play.  Is there something poignant about the selection of this particular reader?  She does Evanovich no justice. The story begins with a missing uncle report...main character "Stephanie's" missing uncle, that is.  Oddly, no one reports that he's missing for 2 days & none seem very concerned about his disappearance.  I found it extremely odd that the family would discuss his absence "over coffecake as is customary in the 'burg in New Jersey."  Pardon me, I'm not from "the 'burg" or NJ but it's really a stretch to believe that everyone from the "'burg" casually discusses the case of a missing relative while dining on coffeecake. Attempts at humor are pathetic, such as: "I got my shower; jumped out & dried my hair by way of styling it."  What????  "Ranger" naturally drives a Ranger (creative genius there).  Stephanie goes on a job & forgets her gun (was I supposed to fret or laugh?  Who knows w/this reader's tonal quality). The novel continues, yet still no one concerns themselves with the missing uncle.  Stephanie sleeps around with carefree abandon but it is tough to take seriously while listening to that lisp!  Characters appear & we really have no clue as to why they immerged onto the scene. (Maybe the clue was in book 1, 2, 3 or 4??) Again, this is the AUDIO version.  The reader's voice works as well as Michael Jackson reading the Da Vinci Code...a no can do! After listening to the audio version of High Five, I can emphatically state: sometimes words are better left unspoken (just read them!) 
 I was Looking for a book about reversals, and I read so many great reviews that I got mine.  I'm not saying the book is bad, I'm so not qualified to do so, but what I didn't like was the tone: "oh we're so good,  our tarot community is so great, we're so cool"...pleeease.  About the book: never got around to finish it, got bored 
 The opening track is an awesome collaboration with Sting.  I thought that if the rest of the CD was that good, I'd love it. It isn't, and I don't.  In fact, there are only two tracks on this disk I really like.  The only other song I liked on it was the very funny Changing Your Demeanor (who knew Derek Bell could honky-tonk like that?!).  The rest of it just doesn't work.  Tom Jones does such a hammy job of Tennessee Waltz, he ruins one of my all-time favorite songs.  And I'm sorry, but Mick Jagger singing The Rocky Road to Dublin is just wrong.  A rare misfire from a usually rock-reliable group of musicians 
 Attached is an extract of my letter to Larry Berman dated April 01, 2002.  Subject: "No Peace, No Honor"  Dr. Berman: I am reading (with great skepticism & disagreement) your above book. I have a keen interest in Vietnam War history (and pseudo history) and have recently received from my daughter (college librarian)the Choice heads up about your book....(I was a 1956 Political Science graduate of The University of the South and was a co-pilot in SAC until 1959. We, of course, Studied Dien Bien Phu, the Geneva Accords, SEATO and the then already identified Communist insurgencies in South Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Indonesia and other areas of South East Asia and were well aware of Communist Ho Chi Minh's plans to take over South Vietnam by covert and/or overt invasion, rigged elections, infiltrated agents, democratic [Communist] fronts, etc.). You surely knew all of this at one time (because I note that you too have read Nixon's "No More Vietnams" and his & Kissinger's memoirs...) Apparently you agree with hardly any of Nixon's assessments, or if you do, you have deliberately chosen to adopt the simplistic [straight leftist] history of gentle 'George Washington' Ho Chi Minh and his noble efforts to unify Vietnam [under ruthless totalitarian Communism] and his betrayals after the Geneva Accords..(p18 et seq). (I really think that you are too smart for this and what follows and that you have adopted the "Russian style of history writing" that you [and Zumwalt, Jr] attribute to Nixon & Kissinger at p9). In particular, although you do refer, without elaboration, to the Jan 2 & Jan 4 1973, Democratic caucus votes to cut off all funds to Indochina - with legislation to terminate the war speeding its way to the floor..., you do not make the obvious points that the antiwar movement and the determination of the Doves [predominately Democrats] to force an end to the war - with or without a negotiated agreement & whether or not 150,000 NVA troops remained in South Vienam, or Laos or Cambodia, or whether or not all of SE Asia would surely fall into Communist hands - totally under cut Kissinger's negotiation options and forced him to take the only Agreement available. Everyone knew that leaving 150,000 NVA troops in place was a terrible option and that continued US military support of South Vietnam would be essential, and that strict US enforcement of the Paris Agreement - by resumed bombing of strategic military targets might well be necessary. (As you well know, the North concluded in 1968, or earlier, that the growing antiwar movement and the outspoken Democrats would force an end to the war within a few years, or less, and that victory could be obtained - if only the North could hang on until Congress defunded the war. Gen Giap has confirmed this and has stated that he designed a strategy to avoid large & costly full scale engagements, but to hide in the jungles & Cambodian sanctuaries and initiate enough ambushes to keep the US body count high, and to stall the peace negotiations indefinitely...) You, of course, conclude [very much disingenuously, in my opinion] that Kissinger was out-negotiated, that the Paris Agreement & Nixon brought no peace, and no honor, and that he and Kissinger deceived the American people into thinking that the terms of the cease-fire would be the end of the American involvement [I don't know of anyone who thought that...] and that this was a dishonorable two-faced deception, and that Nixon [& not the US Congress] betrayed our South Vietnam allies by forcing them to accept an Agreement that could only be enforced by continued US monetary & air power support - which Nixon fully intended to provide (as well as secretly promised reconstruction aid to the North - as an economic incentive to abide by the Agreement...). Watergate, of course, prevented Nixon from re-introducing air power to enforce the Agreement, and light weight Ford had neither the leadership ability nor inclination to advocate for strict enforcement - absent Congressional willingness to do so. The betrayal of South Vietnam and the dishonoring of the American people was Congress' doing - at the urging of the Doves and antiwar protestors like John Kerry, et al. As you know - and conveniently failed to even discuss in your book that purports to assess blame for the betrayal - [Russian history style..] - Nixon very clearly & cogently [and convincingly, in my opinion] laid out the facts upon which he concluded that the US Congress "Lost the Peace". ("No More Vietnams", Chapter5) You also assert that Nixon & Kissinger deceived and misled the American people [and the Congress] and did everything they could to deny any independent access to the historical record and that only [now?] "This story of diplomatic deception and public betrayal has come to light only because of the release of documents and tapes that Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger sought to bury for as long as possible." This too is disingenuous, in my opinion. I find very little in your book that was not more comprehensively presented in Kissinger's 1979 book "White House Years". (He had at leased ten times [this is an exaggeration] more facts about the Paris negotiations than you did, and I do not find any place in your book where you demonstrate that any statement by Kissinger was false - or even misleading or deceptive. In other words, I find very little in your book that is new - other than your gratuitous assertions that you have uncovered new data that shows that Nixon & Kissinger were dishonorable and deceived and betrayed the American people....In my opinion, your slanderous assertions are not supported by the facts contained in - or conveniently omitted from - your sensational and poorly reasoned book. But this is just my opinion, and who cares?? John Elli 
 Get this set if you plan on having a bad time.  Barely will you be in to 'Good evening' when the lessons quickly turn to "Stop thief!" or "He stole my watch"  or better yet, "I want an attorney"  -- all of which are phrases I have NEVER used in France.  Fodor's should have had the good sense to give practical lessons first,  etiquette, directions, service, culture etc. before launching into rude commands and pick-pocket paranoia 
 Hmmmm.... infomercials now seen as documentaries? If you are in need of hope then I guess you'll believe anything. Harry Potter was so much better than this .... guess JK Rowling has a much better imagination than JZ Knight.  Post-September 7 review given all the hoopla over What the Bleep - Quite frankly: Did the people rendered homeless by the Tsunami create that? Did the students injured at the recent shooting at Dawson College in Montreal (Canada) create that? Or even still ... did the people who were on the New Zealand airplane that crashed in fall 2006 in the Pacific create that as well? Sometimes others impose their wills on innocent bystanders through brutal force and that is not creating your day. That is just plain tragic. We are not victims of life but neither are we masters of the universe either. 
 Jack R. Meredith and Samuel J. Mantel, Jr. have written an academic reference book about project management that is at times dry, theoretical, and boring to read. However, their book is at other times a good, interesting reflection tool for an experienced project manager. A green project manager will often have difficulty to relate the content of the book to his/her new practice. Based on my own experience, there is ultimately no better learning school than getting his/her hands "dirty" in the field under the supervision of an experienced project manager to learn the ropes of the job 
 What does it mean when someone gets excessively-defensive? It doesn't express that they have peace or comfort with themselves.  Writing sludge like this just fuels the fire - that I suppose they are trying to put out. If .. there .. WAS .. ever .. a .. fire. 
 This book has a whole lot of writing about the writer.  This whole book is  basically reading and about 12 or 13 pictures.  The pictures are quite  stupid, basically all the pictures show are either things most people  already know or how to get yourself killed when a gun is pointed at your  head.  This is a pretty terrible book for anything more than just reading.   This book sucks.  HOO-YAH!!!!  Thank all war veterans 
 This is, by far, the worst vocal selections I've ever bought!  And I've bought a lot of bad ones!  I was in this show two years ago and had a fantastic time(I played Nicely-Nicely)!  So I didn't hesitate to order the music, but when it arrived I found the selections chopped beyond recognition!  And not only are they chopped, but they're also simplified!  This book should be marked "Easy Piano!"  If you're looking for a good rendition of this music, spend the extra $20 and buy the score 
 To customer before me, you camera D200 might be on recall. Please check the Nikon website for more info. You have described the exact recall problem. Good luck! BTW, have you tried or someone tried this battery on a D70? I am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the D70 and grays from the D200. 
 I was totaly disapointed with the ending in this series of books. I felt let down, and like I had waisted my time and money on the entire series 
 Barron's should be ashamed of themselves, foisting a language workbook with no answers in it on an unsuspecting public. Because it's impossible to check if your answers are right or wrong, this book is totally useless for self-learners. Should be sold only with a giant sticker on the cover stating: "WARNING! NO ANSWERS PROVIDED". Blurbs about the book on web sites (are you listening, Amazon?) should not fail to state the same. Then at least people would know what they are, and are not, getting. Heartily NOT recommended 
 This book begins with "The Three Statements That Strike the Essential Points" from the Last Testament of Garab Dorje the first human master of Dzogchen: "One is introduced directly to one's own nature", "One definitively decides upon this unique state" and "One continues directly with confidence in liberation." They seem straightforward enough - OK maybe a little terse. Dudjom Rinpoche's Short Commentary (1 page) is very nicely translated and to the point. Next is a short work by Patrul Rinpoche with his poetic commentary that develops things further. By its end we are up to Page 67. Then Mr. Reynolds commentary kicks in - wow. I read it but it's some pretty rough sledding. Far, far too many insertions of Tibetan terms break the flow of what is, after all, supposed to be a translation. Then there are nuances (in parens) within interpolations [in brackets]like this from Page 145:    "As for the the real meaning of this: [All of] the states [consisting of the nondual gnosis or knowledge (which is primordial awareness) present in the hearts]of all the Sugatas are encompassed within this (single unique state of immediate intrinsic Awareness found within every individual sentient being)."  Dzogchen just isn't this hard!   The latter part of the book is lengthy scholarly material intended to defend and support Dzogchen's ancient lineage problem and its radical differences from Tantric Mahayana Buddhism. Hey,it either works in your spiritual life or it doesn't. What difference does it make if the concepts and techniques arose in 2,500 BCE or 1100 CE? Read "The Mirror, Advice on Presence and Awareness" by Namkhai Norbu and you can start living it - today.       
 Everytime i try to listen to jah i just think dam it's time to throw that cd out window and put on dmx, his voice and lyrics sound more like dmx's than pac's plus dmx wips his ass at hiphop. It's like jah is D's kid and when he gets outa line he has to be taught a lyrical lesson by his supiorer 
 OK, when I first started reading this book, I enjoyed it.  And I thought I would really enjoy where it was going.  I actually recommended it to several friends (a recommendation I now regret).  That opinion changed rather quickly as the book continued on and on without much to say.  The book started off with Chapman briefly explaining why he thinks some of us feel more connected to God in certain ways (ie., study, worship, prayer, ...).  He argues that this is a result of each of us having a primary love language.  And consequently we relate to God best in our own language.  This was, in my opinion, a very promising insight.  It goes a long way in explaining why my wife and I have different responses to worship and service.  To her, service is a joy, worship is a duty.  To me, it's vice versa.  I think Chapman was on to something.  He then goes on, in the next five chapters, to show how God displays each of the five love languages.  These chapters, although not very insightful, do offer decent support for his original theory.  Unfortunately, however, the book could have ended right here.  Because after this, the next 5 or so chapters seem like one big promotion for Chapman's Five Love Languages book(s) and lecture series.  I also felt as though Chapman was searching for something significant to write about in these closing chapters.  He seems to have run out of material for his original thesis and now just begins writing about anything that relates to love.  Which reminds me, the chapter on discipline was very disappointing.  At one point Chapman actually suggests that a man lost his children as a judgement of God.  Now, I'm not going to debate God's sovereignty in all things nor suggest that God does not have the right over life and death.  But to claim that this man losing his children was judgement from God is a leap of faith I'm not going to take.  All in all, the book is poor, but not terrible.  If you keep in mind that Chapman is a psychologist and not a theologian, you may find some very helpful information here.  But don't expect any grand revelations concerning love or God in this book 
 A few points.  First, there is no settled-upon interpretation of quantum physics.  For any seemingly miraculous quantum phenomenon, there is an interpretation of quantum mechanics which disallows it.  Nonlocality for example, and all of the pseudo-intellectual new age mumbo jumbo that so often accompanies it, does not occur in many interpretations of quantum mechanics.    Second, Goswami is philosophically inept.  It is clear that he has never read philosophy, which is fine for a layperson but is completely unacceptable for a man marauding as a serious thinker in a book the contents of which hinge on arguments for tendentious philosophical positions.  Goswami is terminologically inept as well.  Monistic idealism?  It's simply Idealism, which is by definition a version of monism (since it holds that there is only one kind of thing in existence).  Had this man read his philosophy, he might have both ameliorated his gross abuse of philosophical terminology AND discovered that his ideas have been put forth, hashed and rehashed countless times over the course of at least 2000 years.  Furthermore, no one in academic philosophy or physics gives any credibility to the ideas promoted in this book.  The only people who embrace this garbage are those who are scientifically or philosophically illiterate (or both).  Philosophers dismiss these ideas because the arguments given to support them (in the rare cases that there ARE arguments given) without exception constitute faulty reasoning.  For example, this entire book takes the form of an abductive argument, an inference to the best explanation of what Goswami claims is evidence.  If I may be permitted to make a well-studied value judgement, this argument is weak enough that it could be effectively countered by an average first-year college undergraduate.  Far too weak to hold water or be taken seriously.  As a work of philosophy, this book fails miserably.    Scientists dismiss these ideas because we simply haven't come to understand quantum mechanics yet.  The truth is that no one (not even Nobel laureates) can agree on an interpretation of quantum mechanics.  To claim as evidence for his position the role of consciousness in quantum mechanics and the existence of instances of nonlocal causation is to build an architecturally flawed building on top of a house of cards in the middle of a wind storm.  The book is logically and empirically bankrupt.    So why did Goswami write the book?  Why risk his career?  Funding.  Fantastic ideas attract attention and with attention comes more funding.  My advice?  Find a serious and respectable work on interpretations of quantum mechanics.    This book fails as science and the overwhelmingly flaky and credulous Goswami fails as a scientist.  This book is a fine example of a scientist doing the exact opposite of what scientific principles perscribe 
 Each of the women profiled in Holland's book are certainly facinating.  It's her treatment of these subjects that I found rather insipid. Holland writes from a 19th century perspective, as if there has been no advancement in the status of women over the course of the last century. Her quips did little to raise my interest and, in my opinion, only served to diminish the important lives that she so lopsidedly profiled.  From which backwards planet does she hail 
 "Is it really my failure, or theirs?"  Carol Kennicott asks herself this question nearly 250 pages into "Main Street," regarding her impossible relations with the residents of  the town of Gopher Prairie, Minnesota. By this time, I was asking a similar question: "Is it really my failure, or Sinclair Lewis's?"  "Main Street" seemed a good idea as it sat on my shelf. Touted as a satirical look at middle-class America, it was Lewis's first successful novel, ushering in a new era upon its publication in 1920, and breaking critical ground for the Golden Age of American Literature, of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Faulkner. Lewis was the first American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. How could I go wrong picking it up?  The book tells the interminable story of Mrs. Kennicott, who marries a country doctor while imagining herself an improving influence on his as-yet-unseen town of Gopher Prairie. Imagine her surprise when she is greeted not as a liberator but grist for the gossip mill, with her Big City ideas and lack of churchiness.  Carol's alternating turns of resistance and acceptance are about the sum total of this plotless book. Lewis's descriptive powers are much in evidence, and you find yourself trapped in G.P. as much as Carol, his descriptions of noisy neighbors and smug dinner parties bearing the unmistakable imprint of someone who grew up in small-town Minnesota and knew of what he wrote. The problem, when you get past the period slang and the barbed commentary, is that the subjects of Lewis's satire are so miserable and nasty you can't understand why Carol thinks she can change them, except perhaps with the idea nature couldn't possibly create people as one-dimensional as those found here.  I thought I'd never read a duller work about small-town Americana from the early 20th century than Thornton Wilder's "Our Town." My apologies, Thornton. "Main Street" is as down on the same locale that "Our Town" exults, only Lewis lays on derision with a dripping trowel. Wilder, by contrast, seems almost surgical in the delicacy with which he makes his points. Lewis makes sure that when he presents us with the atheistic radical Miles Bjornstam, he is not only a voice of reason and affability to Carol but ultimately run out of town for his beliefs on the heels of having suffered a great tragedy, just in case we didn't otherwise get how miserable a town Carol is stuck in.  "And you want to reform people like that when dynamite is so cheap?" Carol fumes early on.  There is one effective section in the book, when Carol first discovers how isolated she has become and feels the "moist, fleering eyes" of prying neighbors so powerfully she draws down her window shades. Passages with her husband, the stolid, straying, but not worthless Dr. Kennicott, present some desperately-needed ambiguity.  But the book just keeps going, hammering home the same points, before winding down with an ending that feels more like a cop-out, in which the still-radical but more placid Carol settles for the status quo while imagining her sleeping infant daughter as "a bomb to blow up smugness." Polemics can produce great writing, but seldom great literature, and "Main Street" is a case in point.  The Signet Classic edition from 1998 features an introduction by Thomas Mallon which was the most enjoyable part of the book, candidly pointing out the book's faults but arguing for its continued value, as it imagines Carol's experience being like that of a young Hillary Rodham first arriving in Little Rock. Suffice to say I had a lot more fun reading it than I did the rest of this book 
 This is yet another cookie cutter writing book. Very little in this volume was new to me and the author's attitude toward certain types of writing, such as contemporary literary fiction, was more than a little insulting. Perhaps he can include a chapter called "Don't Insult Your Readers" in the next edition.  If you've never read a writing book before, this one has some practical advice in it, but you can get this type of information elsewhere 
 I got about 40% through it, but couldn't make myself finish this one, since I just couldn't care about the protagonist. Grace Archer is a control freak. That causes her to make foolish decisions. She has trouble accepting help when she's in over her head. If she were family, you'd stick by her. If she's only a character in a book, you might just close the book and say, "Enough!" I did 
 I bought this book because of all of the good reviews. I was NOT impressed. First of all, the writing is mediocre at best. The stories offer little in the way of meaningful character development and delve right into poorly worded sex scenes. The first three stories I read were about anal sex, watching your wife give another man oral sex and humiliating your husband by tying him up and ball-gagging him then penetrating him with a strap on. To be honest these stories turned me OFF and I'll be returning the book. Save your money this is not good 
 I have subtitles when Shakira sings and it still doesnt make sense. She has a nice voice but the rest of her fall flat. Her dancing doesnt impress me, hell every female out there today can dance. She really doesnt make me want to speak spanish either 
 After reading this book, I was left to wonder: What did RR really do while president?  The book is written from the middle, but with an emphasis toward the positive aspects of RR's presidency, with small amounts of  negativity thrown in for balance. The book doesn't talk much about any one  subject. A good quick primer on this mediocre president who will go down in  history as one of the most divisive, deceptive presidents of our country 
 I live in Texas and have read in the news about the discovery of the Belle, and LaSalle's adventures.  I have also visited France many times, and I was looking for a good book to send to my French friends.  Not this book.  I've only read half of it, and then I gave up.  It is a very hard read.  Sometimes it reads like a history book or narrative, sometimes it reads like a commentary on history, and sometimes it reads like an editorial, with comments made on other historians.  To the extent that it is a history book, it does not always appear to discuss events chronologically.  It's hard to tell sometimes because it is such a hard read - hard to follow.  It appears that the author skips around a lot, and there is not a good flow to the writing.  Also, there was very little in this book on the recent discovery of the Belle 
 I purchased this book on the recommendation of one of my Ph.D. program professors who likes it better than de la Fuente's book. I agree that it's better than Fuente, but that's not saying much.  Simon and Blume wrote the book for people who not only already know mathematical economics, but who also think fluently in mathematics.  It's not for the beginning Ph.D. candidate in economics, but for the accomplished professor.  If you already know the material, I suspect that Simon and Blume will allow you to quickly reference any of the topics it covers.  If you're struggling to learn mathematical economics, however, don't try to use this book because it will reinforce any fears you might have about your ability to learn the subject in the first place 
 Director:  Douglas Cheek Cast:  John Heard, Daniel Stern, Christopher Curry, Kim Greist, Laure Mattos, Brenda Currin, Justin Hall, Michael O'Hare, Cordis Heard. Running Time:  88 minutes Rated R for language, violence, and gore.  One of the opening images in the supremely cliched "C.H.U.D"  (which stands for Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers) is a full-on shot of a truck banner reading "Slow Moving Vehicle." That's the most valid image in the whole film. Under Manhattan, mysterious creatures terrorize the homeless who live in the sewers, and begin striking those who walk the streets as well. When one disappearance involves a precinct captain's wife, the captain starts investigating the situation by asking around a neighborhood soup kitchen.  The captain, Bosch, is played by Christopher Curry, a here-and-gone Martin Mull lookalike whose casual handling of his wife's disappearance would come off as absurd if we hadn't previously gotten a load of what she looks like. While Curry is the main actor, two better-known names have key supporting roles, Daniel Stern as the grimy soup kitchen director (only the destitute would accept a meal from him) and John Heard as a photographer.  Heard's character has little to do with the story, and the way he's brought in is lazy and forced. He has some photos of streetpeople, and one homeless woman calls him for bail. He takes a photo of a gored leg that shows something sinister is going on, though all I saw was bad make-up. Through most of the film, we see him blow off deadlines and interact unaffectionately with his live-in girlfriend, played by Kim Griest. Heard here is smug and charmless, wasting away as "C.H.U.D." decomposes before the very eyes of the audience.  Sewer creatures rising up in the big city is not a bad concept, but not only does the film fail to do anything with it, the audience get a lot of inert moments where people trade clich-ridden dialogue and ridiculous characterization.  There's a stonewalling government official played by George Martin who bulges his eyes and sneers at every question and gives us an obvious central villain since the budget is too cheap to show us much of the monsters. The creatures are meant to horrify but merely look like inept Halloween window displays, while the unbearable synthesized score sounds like a seven-year-old toying with a department-store display organ.  The whole movie is like that, jumping from effect to effect, hitting us with little shock moments here and there, not tying anything in. This is not scary, just annoying. "C.H.U.D" gets mentioned as an askew satire, but just isn't in the same class as "Tremors" or "Return of the Living Dead," let alone an "Evil Dead film".  To recite another clich: You have been warned. 
 Having used the Owl Clip Light with success previously, chose to order through Amazon (to a secondary provider)for a gift.  The gift finally arrived, broken and unable to be used.  Also, at the same time, ordered one to keep for future gift - it has never arrived. Probably will never order through a secondary provider again 
 I was given the fryer as Christmas gift.  We used it twice - worked perfectly, great features - pretty idotic proof in being able to set time and temp.  Third try, the LED on the control unit started flashing random numers, letters and symbols.  The reset never functioned @ all, heating element failed - essentially a total meltdown.  Called DeLonghi, they requested I send the unit to a service center in New Mexico which I did.  A month later, no unit, no response from service center 
 There is a problem with the DVD, it freezes up right in the middle of the documentary 
 I am extremely disappointed in "The Inside Ring" by Mike Lawson.  Injecting his personal political views into the book as a way of adding current events into a fiction book has made this unreadable.  I did not select his book to read his political views.   Here are some references that I believe are linked to current administration.   Page 21 - Reference to Dixie Chicks Page 28 - Reference to the "invisible weapons of mass destruction 
 Since his retirement in 2000 as Bishop of the Episcopal Church in Newark, John Shelby Spong has fashioned himself as a leading spokesperson for a radically progressive Christianity. In a dozen or so books he has insisted that institutional Christianity must aggressively question the very essence of its faith inheritance, and not just in a cosmetic way that tinkers with the fringes. Rather, he admits that his drastic antidotes might kill the patient, although it is not clear that he would view that outcome as unfortunate (pp 58, 178). His current book is simply one more verse of this refrain. Given his unsparing and unflinching critique of a church he spent a lifetime serving, I wondered why he even wants to continue to identify himself as Christian. To be sure, his alternate proposal has at best only a tenuous connection to anything historically or theologically Christian.             I suspect that those who would like to address the very important question Spong's title purports to address will find his book disappointing. His style and tone throughout are condescending towards those with whom he disagrees (mainly anyone more conservative that he is). He categorically disparages these people as profoundly ignorant, duplicitous, repressed, and pitiable. Complex issues are oversimplified. Speculative and dubious opinions (Mary was Jesus's wife, Paul was a repressed homosexual, Judas did not exist) are offered as serious alternatives. He constantly invokes the weakest, weirdest, and most bizarre forms of arguments to dissect (straw man arguments). Finally, there is the feel of self-promotion and kitsch to this book. I mean, what are we to make of a dust jacket that includes a blurb by Bill O'Reilly of Fox News and the hype that "history will recognize Spong as one of the major change agents of modern Christianity." I tend to think of people like Spong as fundamentalist liberals.             All this is unfortunate because the ostensible subject of his book is so very important. What are we to make of the passages in the Bible itself that, upon simple reading, sound so horrible? Like God's command to exterminate the Canaanites, or the death penalty for cursing or breaking the sabbath? Paul's insinuation that homosexuality is God's punishment for improper worship? Related but slightly different, what about how so many believers have abused the Bible to support horrendous evils like slavery or genocide? Spong writes that he wants to "filter" the Bible through the sieve of contemporary knowledge; that is good and necessary. But we also need to learn to move in the opposite direction, to filter the world and all its evils through the Scriptures. Interpreting the ancient Scriptures in our contemporary world, then, is a complex task, and one is likely to find little serious help in Spong's shrill manifesto.             For a great orthodox-liberal dialogue, read the many exchanges between Tom Wright and Marcus Borg. For creedal development try Pelikan. For how and why religion becomes evil (a major theme for Spong), there is Charles Kimball. Showing very little awareness of how his own social location and theological commitments might have shaped his own thought, Spong exemplifies the dilemma of taking the Jeffersonian scissors to the text, which is that you end up with a Bible that looks remarkably like your own image 
 Quite possibly one of the worst movies of all time. Clive Owen is really cool, but not in this movie. Angelina Jolie's polital agenda totally fueled this film. What a waste of time 
 THE HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE (1984) in theory should have been a fascinating, exciting movie with a lot of crowd-drawing power, from its all-star cast, made up of Jodie Foster, Nastassja Kinski, Rob Lowe and more, all in their prime ... aged 20 to 30 years, at the time.  Unfortunately, this picture was written in 1 of 3 possible ways: someone who's adapted the painting technique of throwing buckets of paint at a canvas, calling himself a painter, and the result, a painting to the movies; or someone with the mental age of 10; or someone who has not only totally lost their mind, and has lost touch with reality, in the present, and in their past.  Of course, it's a treat to see Foster, Kinski, Lowe in action, as they are truly talented, in bringing forth subtle human undercurrents, and visual expressions to the camera and audience.  But, this work apparently attempts to carry to the silver screen, a novel in the style of Kurt Vonnegut, for example, or Douglas Adams, who wrote Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy, among others. I haven't read, (and now, would probably decline to ever read) the original manuscript or novel, but, most would probably give the benefit of the doubt to the underlying book author.  In terms of movie, though, there's indubitably no redeeming value to it, as it's a unrelenting, spastic sequence of absurd, tasteless, unnecessary, unsavory moments, involving taboo after taboo, intermixed with a sugar coating, to perhaps confusem, fool and mesmerize the censors or movie rating authorities.   The sugar coating of the taboos, might perhaps make palatable the underlying sequences to those with a low IQ, or perhaps to children, but for all others, including teenagers, or seniors or those with a wicked sense of humor, there's really no coherent story progressing over the  90 mins.  As such, and the best remedy is really the fast forward button on the DVD player, or, if you prefer (as was the case, in the 80's when this work was released), getting up from your chair, and walking out of the theatre 
 I really didn't enjoy this book. It was very basic, informal, and short. It didn't teach me anything that you or I couldn't of came up with. Basically, all the author tells you to do is do your homework, go to class, and pick a major that isn't Economics. The book didn't have any "secrets" about getting As in college 
 In "Using Terri", Jon Eisenberg attempts to provide the reader with insight into the legal, ethical, moral, and medical aspects of the tragic death of Terri Schiavo.   He falls far short of the mark on all of them.  In his November 6, 2005 review for the New York Times William Saletan succinctly sums up the book:  ""Using Terri" is just another use of Terri."   Eisenberg begins with the death of his 79 year old aunt Ros trying to draw a parallel between her and Terri.  The situations could not be more different.  No one, not Eisenberg, nor her two brothers had any desire to care for Ros.   Her case is indeed tragic and agonizing.  Had she not been dehydrated to death her fate would most probably have been to remain institutionalized and uncared for until she finally succumbed to a sad end.  A very different fate awaited Terri were she to be delivered into the care of her parents and siblings.  She would have received the best loving care and devotion that her parents could lavish on her; she would have most probably lived a long life, giving love to all those around her and perhaps even being able to receive the love that was lavished upon her.  But Eisenberg and the bioethics community would have us believe that Terri's life was a life "not worthy of life".   They are absolutely certain, beyond all doubt, that a severely brain damaged person is, in fact not a person at all.   He or she is simply a vegetable to be treated as an inanimate object.  Vegetables, like pet rocks, and tomatoes can never receive love.  Vegetables do not have, nor should they have, access to the rights and privileges that "normal" people take for granted.  This certainty permeates Eisenberg's book at every level and every page.  Symptomatic of this certainty is the obscenely arrogant inscription placed by Michael on Terri's tombstone which reads "Born December 3, 1963, departed this earth February 25 1989, at peace March 31, 2005."     What Eisenberg and so many in the bioethics community conveniently forget is that all too often the most horrendous acts of cruelty and evil are committed by those that, like them, are absolutely certain that what they are doing is good and just.  Jacob Bronowski devotes a chapter in his classic work "The Ascent of Man" to the issue of knowledge and uncertainty.   In describing the Nazi horror he stands in swamp outside the crematorium at Auschwitz and declares:   "When people believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality, this is how they behave. This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods... We have to cure ourselves of the itch for absolute knowledge and power."       If you feel you must read this book I would at least urge you to exam impartially the other side.  Read Wesley Smith; read David Galenter, read Dr. Daniel Eisenberg; read Jacob Bronowski; read Rita Marker, and yes read father Frank Pavone whom Eisenberg so brutal and unjustly demonizes.   They are my heroes.   And question Eisenberg's statements, his description of the events, his conclusions and especially his demonizing of those who disagree with him.  Sometimes one's motives and philosophies can be revealed in the most trivial passages.  There is one such sentence that especially struck me in "Using Terri"; on p 191 Eisenberg describes the scene at the hospice on the last day of Terri life:  "A woman blew on a shofar - a ritual horn sounded by the ancient Hebrews during battle."   As a Jew and as human being I find such appalling ignorance of my religion deeply insulting.  But in a wider sense perhaps it is symptomatic of Eisenberg's utter contempt for everything that does not fit into a purely secular framework and does not worship at the altar of the false god of autonomy.    
 Unfortunately, my experience with this product is less than stellar.  For one, I am a very hairy man.  A VERY HAIRY MAN.  The look was completely different from the picture.  Secondly, upon closer inspection of the product pictured, it appears that the model has a SOCK stuffed in the front!  That must be what they mean by super sock.  Anyway, when I crammed my package in there, it looked a prairie dog popping up out of its hole.  Lastly, watch out for the string...it gets stinky 
 I've read a few books by ex-CIA folks now and they all seem to have an overblown sense of arrogance and self-importance. Drumheller makes the case that the CIA was made the scape-goat in the lies that supported the Iraq invasion by providing faulty intelligence. The critical point being the Iraqi informant called "Curveball" that was being protected by German intelligence. Drumheller laments that Curball's self-serving claims where used without proper vetting out, that he (Curveball) had been long declared a "fabricator", and that no American intelligence professional had even been allowed to speak with him before Colin Powell used the unproven claims to construct his now famous "mobile biological labs" speech delivered to the UN as the 'foundation' of the WMD case. Drumheller makes this case within the first 90 pages of his book, but also convinces you that while he might be right, he could have been a little more proactive when it mattered. For example, after he reached his epiphany that the administration was molding the intelligence to fit the politics, he should have started talking to the press right then and there.  Drumheller's entire mission in this book was to say "the CIA is a good organization, we did our job, but we where   wronged". Maybe so, but you took an oath to protect and defend the constitution, you saw it being trashed, and you did nothing when you could have made a difference. 
 ...and put their own little spin on it!  Going to split this into 2 reviews, one based on it from the book, the other just based on the movie in general.  The book "The Tommyknockers" is set in the town of Haven, Maine, where strange thing's start to happen to the townspeople after Bobbie Anderson find's a large, mysterious object in the woods behind her farm.  Curious, she starts digging it up, and with each shovel full of removed dirt, open's up a terrifying and life-altering experience for all those involved.  1)  The movie based on the Stephen King Novel:  2 stars  I watched the movie after reading the book (my own personal rule) and though at time's felt like they were true to the book, was often left going "huh?" at the changes that were implemented.  Certain thing's are left out, while replaced by hollywood's cheap imagination.  The missing teeth as well as the batteries and inventions running off them never really hit home, and though the book had a multitude of characters who had important part's of the story, we see some simply vanish and never make it to the mini-series.  Perhaps the Tommyknockers got to them first! Since it was a miniseries and ran over 2 hours, there was no reason to chop and hack this thing up and replace it with alternate scenarios and a different ending.  I was disappointed to see how Hilly was found, as well as the fate of Gard and the ship, and Marge's ultimate destiny comes out differently as well.    2)  The movie in general, without comparing it to the book: 3 stars  Margie Helgenberger and Jimmy Smit's do a very good part cast as Bobbie and Gard.  The overall pace of the mini-series roll's along well, and the production and directing is okay.  The sound is good and set's the mysterious mood that the town of Haven is faced with.  Disappearing people, mysterious inventions run off batteries, and a mob like atmosphere are all displayed as we wait to see who the tommyknockers are, and what exactly they want with the townspeople of Haven.  An excellent cast overall considering the many various character's that had to be portrayed in the story 
 Once again in fantasyland we go with fake "gangstas".P diddo or diddity, pifily poof what ever his name is this week.This movie is not worth the price of the plastic used to make it.the established italian mobsters would not put a black or puerto rican on equel footing.these guys would not share the same area in the joint.ridiculous!!!when it comes to TRUE GANGSTERS there are serious racial/ethnic barriers.That is just the facts.As much as the mass media tries to rewrite history it still doesnt change it 
 especially when there's a pretty girl invovled but this is just dreadful. the songs are so cheesy, her voice is out of place in half the songs. it's whiny, irritating, dull and at this point, I'm not sure who's more talented, her or her sister. they got the looks, sure, but there's lots of pretty girls in this world, doesn't mean they deserve a singing contract just to look hot on the cover of the cd. & that's the only thing that intrigued me to listening to this album. & I'm sorry Jes, but maybe u really are as brain dead as people say 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 With the other reviews I read before buying this book, I thought this must contain some groundbreaking techniques, but I was surprisingly disappointed instead. It was more like hyped-up motivational stuff, along with fairly obvious advice along the lines of: Be outgoing, be nice to people, be interested in others, be helpful, present yourself well, etc. I can't say this isn't good advice, but it's not exactly breakthrough. The author also continuously throws in various odd trademarked slogans like "Be Progress". If someone needs basic motivation to get out and confront talking to people, and present themselves well, maybe this book is helpful. Perhaps there isn't a lot more to this subject that anyone could write a good book about 
 The title of the book is nonsense. Abraham Lincoln is the most misunderstood figure in American history. He was an individual from humble beginnings who betrayed his nation for greed and power. As an attorney, he represented corporations and the wealthy and powerful. As President, he defied the Constitution and law by forcibly preventing the Southern states from lawful secession. Of course, he also illegally imprisoned newspaper editors, conscripted the poor and immigrants (while permitting the wealthy to buy their way out of service), suspended the Writ of Habeas Corpus, manipulated the freeing of the slaves only from those states which seceded, promoted racial discrimination and their return to Africa, and was primarily responsible for the death of more than 620,000 of his countrymen. Everyone should read "The Real Lincoln," a book which contains the true facts about this dictatorial fool. In other more civilized nations, slavery was abolished by payments made by the government to the slave owners, acknowledging their prior lawful property rights. It was the law and government which permitted slavery. Lincoln did not argue against slavery. To the contrary he only "freed" the slaves when he was losing the war. Then he committed countless war crimes by burning and destroying entire cities and murdering civilians. A war built on lies? Does it sound familiar? Our historians are not worthy of the name 
 This book is entirely too violent for ages 4-8.  While the illustrations are good, the text has various references to torture and killing.  It may be factually accurate as to the life of a pirate, but its too much reality  for young children 
 THIS BOOK IS REALLY BAD. NEITHER FOR AMATEURS NOR FOR THOS WHO WANTS TO BRUSH UP THEIR BASIC ACCOUNTING KNOWLEDGE 
 Even though I am not a Sophia Loren fan, I thoroughly enjoyed her perfomance in these 3 different short stories about 3 totally different women. Anyone born before 1940 should enjoy them as well 
 I saw it on TV and LOVE that movie. I was so thrilled to get DVD to watch it again BUT the negative thing is there is NO CLOSED CAPTIONED or SUBTITLE for Deaf, Hearing Impaire and Hard of Hearing people. Its too sad. It isnt worth it to buy it. 
 The thing is that it is not a very stable camera, hence it does not give you very stable shots, so many of your pics will be blured. Even those taken with a tripod. I am a pro photographer, and I would not recommend this camera. Yes, it's very thin, but is not worth the pics it takes...Seek for other model not so tiny if you're expecting better images 
 This was my second book by James Robert Baker, so obviously there was something in the first book I read by him (Testosterone) that made me want to know more of his work. I think with this one I've had my fill. If this and Testosterone are two of his best works, I've had enough.(btw, I thought Testosterone much the better of the two.)  What is interesting about this book was the way Baker described the 80's and 90's and an era of AIDS angst in southern California.  He does capture the mood and the anger that were 'out there' in the gay community in the Regan and early Bush (the pappa) years (I am ten years younger than Baker and was living in Los Angeles in the same time.) So from that perspective the book was a time capsule.   But what was overly annoying were the overdrawn situations and the relationship of Time and Pete.  It just didin't ring true to me.  What did ring true was the anger and the over-the-top obsessive / compusiveness of the protagonist Tim (clearly drawn from Baker's own life experience).  It is sad (but not surprising after reading these books) to learn that Baker committed suicide in 1997 at age 51. He was clearly a man with lots of issues on many levels. And a lot of the issues Baker deals with are not different than issues gay men deal with today (HIV, aging, the superficiality of many gay communiites).  Baker's responses all seem so extreme.   All in all, the book has become a period piece of the days when Act Up and Queer Nation were out there in a big way, which is an interesting counterpoint to the passiveness of the gay community today.  Also, one does wonder if Baker would have toned-down his brash and outlandish writing style with the advent of some maturity that comes with age. 
 I have read several books in this genre, and this has to be one of the dullest books on the market that deals with life in Italy.  I've lived in Italy on two occasions for short periods of time and can't help but wonder - if Mr Parks dislikes Italy so much, why is he still there?  He certainly comes across as disliking Italy and Italians.  This has none of the humor or whimsy of other similar books.  Very disappointing.   I should have know better since I also read "Italian Neighbors" and was unimpressed by it 
 I can not recommend this book.  While reading it I found 4 major errors.  This leads me to believe that the author did not do any research nor did his editors do any fact checking.  The 4 errors I found are as follows: 1. The author states that no trace of the crew of the B-24 Lady Be Good was  ever found.  All but one of the bodies of the crew of the Lady Be Good were  found by the mid-1960s.  2. The author states that Zeke was the allied name  for a kamikaze.  Zeke was the U.S. Navy code name for the Japaneese  Mitsubishi Zero-sen fighter plane.  The U.S. Navy gave Japaneese fighters  male names and bombers female names.  Any WWII historian should know this.   3. The part about the rescue of Eddie Rickenbacker says that a 2-man  Kingfisher float plane spotted their raft and they were picked up by a PT  boat.  In reality, the Kingfisher landed on the ocean and picked them up.   Since the plane only had two seats, the survivors held on the wings and the  pilot taxied across the water to an island.  4.  In the section on the  death of Joe Kennedy Jr. he states that the mission was to attack the  London Gun sites.  This is incorrect, the mission was to attack  U-boat  pens.  He also incorrectly states the crews of the bombers were to bail out  over German held territory.  The crews were to bail out over England and  the bomber would be flown by radio control to the target. There are other  things in the book that just don't seem correct.  I can not recommend this  book.  Mistakes like this make one doubt the accuracy of the rest of the  book.  The author is supposed to be a WWII historian.  If he is, then why  are such obvious errors in the book 
 a shark invading Seaworld, wow, were the writers on drugs? Bad acting,  my McFarlane model looks better then the shark, and what the hell were these clowns thinking about? Possiblly the worst sequel except for Jaws the Revenge. What a fricking joke. This film proves, put the Jaws name on a poster and people will come, for like a week, this is a piece of crap. Ask Dennis Quaid, and the rest if they felt they put a great film out.    They act as if if never happened, good for them, this movie needs to be flushed down a toilet, and soon, it really stinks 
 I got a copy of this book a few years back as a Christmas gift, and the title and cover immediately put me off (and I'm really not the type that judges a book by it's cover).  It wasn't until recently that I started reading this novel.  Big mistake on my part.  The novel began well enough, but then began a downward spiral.  It had one of the oddest plots I've ever seen, and that alone normally wouldn't put me off a book.  But in addition to the bizarre story line, it seemed as if Koontz had wrote the book, and then went back and looked up every word he had written in the thesaurus and replaced it with a synonym.  Simple sentences were unneccesarily drawn out, and some of his figurative language (especially that which involved Middle Eastern conflict) was flat and boring.  Truly one of the worst reads I've ever had the displeasure of enduring 
 I bought this case together with Nikin 5900 digcam. The case looks good and compact. But the main problem is with the pockets. There are two pockets for SD cards in the main pocket and one outer pocket for the battery. The problem is that when you open the case to take the camera, all the pockets are also open and stuff can fall from there. Specially when its on your belt.  I won't use this case 
 I have read all of the Artimis Fowl Books and loved them until now  I was disapointed with this one, and not found Artmis unusaly irritating, but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good.   Truth be told I was younger when I read the first three, but still I can reread them and enjoy them (as I did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris) so if you want my advice then I suggst you don't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace 
 This book is fine if you are interested in a purely academic approach. This offers nothing for practitioners 
 This is a philosophy book. There is almost nothing about natural selection and not much more about religion, just plenty of standard philosophy loosely connected to a condemnation of current western culture and its supposed pseudoscience sustenance. Midgley uses the term 'evolution' to mean the philosophizing of scientists and science writers. As religion too is human philosophizing it is hardly difficult to make the two converge.  This 'evolution' Midgley citicizes as being too human-centred. As there is nothing more human-centred than the social sciences, humanities and religion and this 'evolution' is really philosophy then it is an empty criticism. Only the physical sciences look beyond humans but this is unacknowledged.  She is, though, correct in saying that natural selection is not about progress up a ladder nor about a hostile, doom and gloom world. Other than this her grasp of biology is suspect eg she asks how genes can be selfish when they die when the cells they are in die!!!!! No wonder the excellent work of people such as Dawkins is beyond her grasp if she does not understand the connection between body cells and germ-line cells.  Though I generally agree with Midgley's concerns about competitive greed and the destruction of our planet I think she is wrong to blame science, pseudoscience or sociobiology and to disconnect people in modern western culture from their ancestors and their cousins in other cultures. She is clearly out of her depth when it comes to biology, at least.  With a statement that evolution is the creation myth of our age plus the eye-catching mistitle of this book Midgley is far more guilty of hyperbole and melodrama and potentially far more misguided and damaging than, for example, Dawkins when he used the 'as if' selfish gene perspective.  There are a few interesting discussions of works by scientists and philosophers but, especially for the science writers she criticizes, I would very much recommend people read the books themselves and not simply accept Midgley's views on them. 
 the author starts writing about herself.  There were parts of this book that were an absolute joy to read...but eventually, they were marred by the author's relentless self-promotion and conceit.  Reading this, one would  get the idea that Fran Gage single-handedly created the California cuisine  movement.  She mentions landmarks such as Chez Panisse or famous chefs only  to imply that they were influenced by her.  However, when she sets aside  her bias to describe food and cooking, her writing truly comes alive.  An  uneven book, and certainly an exasperating one to get through 
 Social neuroscience is an exciting and important topic of study.  This book does it a disservice.  This book is poorly organized and presents only brief summary of many fascinating ideas.  You might find something that interests you, but you're unlikely to find it in enough detail to get a clear understanding of it.  Honestly I expected better from Daniel Goleman and I was quite disappointed by this book.  Unfortunately I don't yet have a better book to recommend instead 
 Don't listen to those 4 and 5 star ratings, this was truly a dumb story, with no redeeming qualities at all.   No point to the story at all that was the truth and the readers were left with the question of why Randy wanted to find Maria in the first place.  She certainly was a charmer and had everyone dancing to her tune. Ah men and their peabrains 
 Although this product is pretty to look at, one must remember not to bend it to fit as it will crack the silver plating and the bracelet will fall apart in your hands. I do not suggest buying this item as it is not solid sterling silver as you are lead to believe 
 Jim Lehrer is a smart and talented man, but this book is basically a male soap opera, with melodramatic and unrealistic plot twists. You would think that someone with a background in television journalism would be able to capture an original take on a 'celebrity' trial, but all he's done is re-use every cliche that every other similar book has used. And, without giving any plot away, the behavior and motivation of the characters is neither sympathetic or excusable even given the most trying of circumstances. It's a tossed-off work, and it does not do justice to either the POW genre, or as a study of moral behavior. Lastly, and maybe this was corrected later in the book and I overlooked it, John Quincy Adams was the sixth president of the US. 
 How can so many people rate this as a good movie?!?!?  It was downright horrible. It took over thirty minutes for any action to take place, if you want to consider her continuously walking to a bar as some action. Then a co-worker tries something with her, mind you, a CO-WORKER, whom she WORKS WITH. That just seemed like someone threw that scene in to show people that the main hero can fight.   The characters seem to not have aged in 15 years since the accident, her father, and the hero she ends up sleeping with. Come on, absolutely no reason why anyone with good movie tastes should rent this. I did and it was an absolute waste of time. 
 First the good points:  This book is quite well-written, and an excellent overview of many competing "therapies" for autistic children.  Both myself and my sister have worked extensively with autistic children, and we have family members who suffer from both autism and Asperger's syndrome.  But....  This book is EXTREMELY biased--and sadly, not altogether true.  The Lovaas method is praised as "recovering" children from autism, and though Mrs. Maurice repeatedly states that her children are "recovered," from the evidence she herself provides, it's fairly clear her children were not "autistic" to begin with.  It seems that while her daughter may have had some mild-to-moderate form of developmental disorder, she was obviously not autistic (and the idea that her daughter "recovered" in a matter of mere months is ludicrous).  Even sillier is the story of her youngest son, who does not seem to have developed any indications of autism beyond being a late talker.  It seems as if Mrs. Maurice found doctors who told her what she wanted to hear, and then became obssesed with "recovering" her children.  Clearly her daughter benefitted from the early intervention, but Maurice's story lacks credibility.  For those who have children with true autism, Mrs. Maurice's story of a "miracle cure" will prove more devastating than encouraging.  (A particularly tragic story of a woman named "Lucille" is appended to the book, who upended her family's life to enroll her autistic son in a Lovaas-based program--partly on Maurice's advice--and whose son has so far made little progress).  There are autistic children who do become very high-functioning, even mainstreamed, but deficits remain.  That Maurice's children "recovered" so fully and rapidly is proof that they were never autistic to begin with.  At her interview with her child's behavioral therapist, she states decisively, "Anne-Marie IS going to recover."  Of course--since she'd already decided in her mind that her daughter was autistic, it was easy enough to then declare her "recovered" a few months later.  Maurice seems not to understand that autism is a "spectrum" disorder, and she accepts as faith that it is a completely neurological disorder.  Much like depression, autism can have either biological or psychological causes, and the root cause is not always so clear.  At one point she notes "Failed bonding is a result of autism, not the cause"--but again, this isn't always true.  Even more biased is her presentation of the various alternative therapies for autism.  She rejects all medication therapy; various nutritional approaches (such as those for food allergies and Vitamin B) are briefly raised and then dismissed.  Her extreme prejudice towards holding therapy belies her own statement that she believe it to have some "real" if "limited" worth.  She paints Dr. Martha Welch as a dangerous flake, a gross libel.  Dr. Welch may well have been a bit New-Agey for her tastes, but I have seen children benefit enormously from it.    Even more dishonestly, she viciously pans Virginia Axline's seminal "play therapy," which has stood the test of time and which, again, I have personally seen the benefits of.  It is true that behavioral therapy has an excellent track record in terms of helping children become higher-functioning, but no one therapy is a "magic bullet."  In my experience, children benefit from an integrated program which includes behavioral, speech, play, and nutritional therapy (and very often also medication, though the author does not explain her animosity toward it.)    Lastly, though I am not indicting the author for being rich, she blithely ignores the fact that the average parents (not working on a Wall Street, not a nonworking wife who has a full-time nanny anyway, not living in a fancy Manhattan prewar co-op, etc.) cannot afford to have this type of intensive treatment brought into their homes, and must instead become advocates for their children within the local school system.  Maurice does supply some valuable information on the appeals process with schools  and HMOs.  But if you are the parent of an autistic child, think again before reading this book.  It will likely hurt your feelings, and what good information it provides is readily available elsewhere.      
 Literary coincidences occur occasionally, and this year's coincidence is the appearance of two novels about Henry James, both written by authors hailing from countries east of the Atlantic. (The other novel is David Lodge's Author, Author; I'll review that book here soon.) It is as if James has been appropriated by Irish and British authors, having been largely ignored by those of his native America for so long. James, who became a British citizen at the end of his life, spent most of his productive years in England and continental Europe. It is no surprise that his fiction has a European flavor, nor is it any surprise that he is such a beacon for British and Irish writers.  The Master in question is old Henry himself, who, in the final period of his life, has received this nickname from critics in praise of the quality of his prose and plots (James was arguably the greatest American author of his period; I confess to being a James fan myself, and even have a print of his portrait, painted by John Singer Sargeant, on the wall next to my desk).   At this time, Henry attempted to break into the theater, with the belief that he would not only achieve recognition from the general public but also the fortune that accompanies such success. In the way writers want to sell scripts to Hollywood today, James wanted to sell his stories to the London theater. Alas, it was a failure; a resounding failure, one that shook James' resolve and faith in himself.   Tibn is clearly a Jamesophile, yet he portrays old Henry as a socially inept, somewhat confused old man, who is uncomfortable at dinners and balls, and who longs for his preferred solitude, which he eventually finds in the house he purchases in the small town of Rye. While some may claim that this is a valid portrayal of James, though exaggerated, Tibn neglects to provide the book with a plot, and instead merely relates a series of incidents and events in Henry's life. While Tibn's writing is agreeable-it is, naturally, somewhat Jamesian-his story has little interest. Seen as a series of vignettes, cobbled together with flashbacks to try and put some depth into the story, Tibn shows James far too incompletely to make a novel that works.   For Tibn seems obsessed with showing examples of James' alleged homosexuality, going as far as inventing an incident with Oliver Wendell Holmes, when the two of them shared a bed in their youth. Recent years have seen many "scholars" suggesting that James is homosexual, though the evidence is of the "they have weapons of mass destruction" type. In fact, after reading this book, with its unsuccessful denouement, one wonders if Tibn simply wanted to present this hypothesis in a fictional form, and filled in the rest so there would be something worth publishing.   Tibn does little more than fill in spaces around events described by Leon Edel in his monumental biography of Henry James. By fleshing out these events, Tibn does give more life to them than Edel does, but is it worth it? To me, having read Edel recently, and being familiar with James' work, the book seemed to drag on, as I hoped to find some sort of narrative thread in the work. But I was not fortunate; Tibn simply relates events, albeit occurring within a specific period, without doing more than adding dialog and inner impressions to the characters actions.   But this raises a deeper question about such a book. That a writer of Tibn's ilk could simply create a docu-drama of some events in a real person's life suggests that he is in a period of plotter's block. It is relatively simple to depend on reality, and add a few strokes of dialog, and while it is oft said that truth is stranger than fiction, in this case, the truth doesn't provide for an interesting read. James' life was certainly remarkable, yet decidedly uneventful. And Tibn's choice of telling a part of that story in this manner falls flat, in part because there is no real denouement.   Many reviewers seem to be fawning over this book, using such panegyrics as "the literary novel of the summer." But it seems that these critics are jaded, and willingly accept anything that has a "classical" background in order to escape the banality of much contemporary fiction. Henry James was an extraordinary writer, an exceptional man, in his own manner, and his life is quite a story, but he is poorly served by this "novel", which seems to be little more than an exercise in fictionalizing such a man's life. This book will certainly appeal to the boobs (as Mencken called them), who find it just the right thing to make them look smart, but readers looking for a good book would be better off picking up some of the Master's work and ignoring Tibn. 
 I listened all the way through their first album, and I'm not sure what people's definition of raw rock sound is but this band does not produce that.  this band is more pop-punk than it is hardcore.  both albums are pretty repetitive and choppy.  the song "symmetry" got pretty annoying, i had to move on to the next song.  "flights" is a decent single, but if I had to pick a song to listen to it'd be "Contact" because it has more depth and shows more of what the band is capable of.  the rest of the songs sound more like renditions of eachother.  If u are into a very mainstream rock sound, u may like this.  otherwise, I would not suggest this 
 First of all I love the chistmas box the book. I have read it and re-read it. I also liked the other 2 books in the series. But i was dissapointed with this movie. I am not saying that its a bad movie but i think that it took most of what was special and magical and left it out. And also the book didn't take place in the 90's it took place in the 1940's. The acting was average nothing else. the only one to live up to the charater in the book was ms. O'toole as keri. I hope they someday make a more faithful movie also they changed little things that they had no reason to change. richard owned a formal wear co. not a ski company, and they didn't move from seattle 
 The quality and cost of the book was quite disappointing. The pages that were stapled in the book were out of order and other pages were falling out. The first impression was not good.  The content was "ok" but not practical for the introverts that struggle to begin a conversation. If you want to spend this amount on a communication book and learn important details in communicating, I suggest ordering Conversationally Speaking that lists how others perceive you as you converse and how to read others' "signals" during a conversation. Another suggestion is How to Make People Like You in 90 Seconds or Less that also gave better advise on conversations than this pocket guide. 
 I have not yet received the item, so I am not reviewing the item as much as I am providing a review on the vendor. Product was ordered over a week ago and has still not been shipped.  How long should it take to ship out an HDMI cable?  Order from elsewhere is my recommendation 
 I found the main character annoying and unbelivable, as she appears much too clever.  Maybe if she solved her crimes completely by accident it would be believable, but outsmart the police?  It is also somewhat offensive to make fun of the things she does--the senility and forgetfulness in old age, joking and laughing about death and funerals.  The sense of humor is an attempt at being silly but it is offensive.  Living in this kind of environment where one is losing friends and family to death, the loneliness and sadness found there, is a topic and setting of bad taste.  My guess is the author herself does not live under such circumstances, but when she does, maybe she won't make jokes about it anymore.  Just another example of how people in our society take lightly and joke about things that should be taken seriously 
 I recently read "I", "K", and "L" in succession.  Compared to "Innocent" and "Killer", I found Lawless to be slow paced (even though this edition finds Kinsey spontaneously traveling across the country) and the plot twists less surprising.  With others I've read in the series, I am usually hooked relatively early in the story line.  I was 1/3 of the way through this iteration before becoming mildly interested in the outcome.  Even the subplots were not overly attention grabbing (Kinsey has little contact with immediate family, ergo she substitutes others in her life--Henry, Rosie, Pitt family, the criminal elements in this book--as her family...).  I also found it hard to believe that some of the characters that appear in "L" could be so dim-witted on one page, and great possessors of vast knowledge with incredible powers of deduction on the next.  Anyway, there are others in this series I would recommend more highly ("M" being one of them) 
 I was disapointed to discover that this book covers the same information (at some times nearly word for word) as Ms. Hart's weekly column.  However, the book's new material is entertaining and I agree with some of book's concepts regarding setting limits and limiting choices 
 I got this book to check out how Dana Joy's book is like.  The answer is I will not read another of her books.  I was so disoriented and had such a hard time focus I had to give up a third way through the book.  The storyline is awful. I would have assigned 0 if I could.  Sorry.  Julie Garwood and Judith McNaught are my favorite writers.  It's hard to find anyone else as good as them 
 Yann Tiersen produces some truely amazing music.  Get Good Bye Lenin, and also check out Amelie and Rue De Cascades.  But, as stated by another reviewer, be aware that this disc will not work in many CD players, and especially computer CD rom drives.  Apparently this is because the 'copy protection' on the disc breaks the CD standard.  I would suggest buying the music on-line 
 I thought that this short story was very confusing.  Being the age of only 14, I had to read this short story for a book report.  I had some difficulty understanding what it meant and how it all added up in the end.  I think that this is one of Edgar Alan Poe's horrible short stories.  The story had many words that were hard to understand and it didn't make sense at the end.  I reccommend this story to older teenagers and adults.  It is to complicated for young teenagers 
 I got this book and I was suprized to find out that it had very little information whatsoever as to how his tanks were set up and the techniques he uses. I would not recommend this book for anything other then something nice to look at and wish that you hand the time to put into making your own tanks look like that 
 I have three highly gifted children. None of them are interested in reading this book 
 John Ames, the preacher-protagonist of Marilynne Robinson's Gilead, remarks at one point that in all his reading, what he has learned most is that "some very tedious gentlemen have written books." Indeed.   Unlike the deliberately slow-paced narrative of Housekeeping, the epistolary Gilead drags in other, less successful ways. As the aging Ames writes to his son, he attempts to chronicle his own life and gives us glimpses of his father's and grandfather's, both preachers in their own right. But as the elderly do, he tells the story haphazardly, the first hundred pages consisting almost solely of discontinuous ponderings and pithy religious truths. Ames admits, "I sometimes almost forget my purpose in writing this," and the reader grudgingly agrees, starting to wonder if even Robinson believes it when Ames says, "it is hard to make people care about old things."  Not that he doesn't try. For a pastor--and the book is pastoral in more ways than one--Ames can sound obnoxiously self-important ("Often when someone saw the light burning in my study long into the night, it only meant I had fallen asleep in my chair"). His efforts at conjuring religious imagery are riddled with mixed metaphors that often fall short ("Mary Magdelene probably made an occasional casserole, whatever the ancient equivalent may have been. A mess of pottage, I suppose"). Though exceedingly eloquent throughout, he also cops out in his most revelatory moments ("If only I had the words to tell you"), leaving the reader unfulfilled. Like the mysteries of godliness, the book simply leaves us to wonder, if only on something far less significant.  Still, there is balm in Gilead. Though Ames' antagonist (and namesake) doesn't appear until ninety pages into the book, this plotline's parallels with the prodigal son work better than others, and his appearance gives the book a direction that allows it to explore its more successful themes of home and healing. Somehow despite his meanderings, Ames finally brings us to a place where we sympathize with his plight and want to hear his life lessons as much as he needs to share them. If only he had gotten us there sooner 
 Thought this would be a perfect drinking glass.  My husband cracked it the first time he used it - all he did was brush it against another object.  Very expensive item for it to be so fragile 
 Mumia Abu Jamal is not a great writer.  He is, in fact, barely a GOOD writer.  And if he hadn't murdered Daniel Faulkner in the 80's, he'd be just about nobody right now.   This book is filled with horror stories from death row, and Jamal does do a good job of affecting the reader on a gut level--but other writers on the subject (less self interested than Jamal, and far less self important) have pointed out the racism inherent in the American judicial system far better.  The core of Jamal's writing voice (although it seems inconsistent at times, often degenerating into mere rage/personal bitterness rather than any objective viewpoint beneficial to the reader) is anger.  This in itself is no objection to his work, as this has been the case with many authors.  Jamal is not that compelling and his rants are turn-offs.  Being a left-wing liberal, I took an interest in the case of Mumia Abu Jamal years ago.  It took about one week of research for me to realize that this guy is no political prisoner (although they exist:Leonard Peltier's "My Life Is A Sundance" is a good example of REAL activist writing from "inside the pen").  Anyone who has even a little intellectual integrity, right-wing or left-wing, conservative or liberal, has to concur that this guy is guilty after reading about the case.  If he admitted that he committed the crime I'd have a lot more respect for him and would keep reading him for his insider's accounts.  But with his laughable pretense of innocence, everything he writes is poison of a sort.  It is disturbing indeed to see so many of the literati cuddle up to him, some of them very talented:Alice Walker, Norman Mailer, etc.  Maybe if he gets real lucky Mailer can free yet another murderer, like he did with Jack Abbott, so they can kill someone else.  I look forward to the day that Daniel Faulkner's wife writes a book about her horrendous experiences (one can only imagine what this must be like for her), having a nation of uninformed lefties, most of them under the age of 18, cozy up to her husband's killer.           
 I'm going to take the con side of this debate.  Having not really read many comics in the past 20 years or so I really haven't followed any of the Ultimates stuff.  I have had it explained to me by a co-worker that's a big comic buff.  It seems to make sense to update some heros' origins.  After all Nick Fury and Dum Dum Dugan would be in their ninties these days.  I understand that they are also keeping the original origins in place which is fine.  Having said that, I don't know if this is an Ultimate storyline or not but I didn't care for it at all.    Taken as a stand alone movie, if viewed by someone with no idea of who Iron Man is, this is really run of the mill.  Tony Stark wasn't a very cohesive character.  As far as alter-egos go this one is kind of a hypocritical milksap.  He makes a big deal out of not building weapons but has an entire room full of indestructible power armor.  If the suits are for research why the need for powerful lasers and missles?  The writer's seem to face the same dilemma most of Hollywood finds itself in these days.  It's politically incorrect to endorse violence but you still have to give the audience a good action packed fight scene.  As a result you get unrealistic portrayals of altruistic millionaire industrialists and pacifists with more weapons than Dirty Harry.  I may be reading a little too much into a cartoon but the level of some of the violence here (one person gets executed with a gunshot to the back of the head) suggests this is for a mature audience.  If this is the case the writers should have given the actions and motivations more depth.  The biggest problem is the time it takes to actually get to Iron Man.  Once there the fight scenes are few and far between.  The film suffers from the same problem a lot of live action superhero movies suffer from, too much screen time for the alter-ego.  The action sequences are lacking visual impact.  I think that is partly due to the mediocre quality of the animation.  The CG doesn't mix too badly with the hand drawn but it's all just servicable at best.  In the end the movie seemed overly long and convulted with the end being a less than satisfying resolution.  Even if I weren't aware of Iron Man before this I don't think I would recommend it as anything more than a rental 
 I was intrigued by the concept of a detective mystery set in Tang Dynasty China.  Unfortunately the author hasn't mastered the essentials of writing a really good novel.  The characters didn't feel believable, the dialogue is stiff and unnatural, and the plot is slow-moving and contrived 
 I had to say that I, too, thought this was the worst book I have ever read--hands down.  I have a master's degree in comparitive literature, and other than Moll Flanders and Fanny Hill, I have never read a...what did the other reviewer call them "bodice-rippers"?--so it's not a case of lack of taste.  The author of this book is self-indulgent, pompous, "in the know, and I'm never going to let you forget it!"--the whole thing is like listening to a half muttered conversation that after time you realize that you are never going to be let into.  I did plow through to the end, but only as a test of my endurance.  And I cheered at the end--but only because the damned thing was done 
 A soundtrack gets its power from the combination of images with the song. There were a lot of great songs from the movie yet they are not on this lame soundtrack. The soundtrack is okay, the best songs are from Sheryl Crow and Hootie but the songs that are most memorable from the film are missing. I understand that there were probably licensing issues precluding use but that is what makes the soundtrack good...to re-live the euphoria from the film 
 This is one of the worst pieces of christian fiction I have ever read and Tim LaHaye certainly failed with this one. Don't waste your money on i 
 I got this book based on my Buddhist teacher's advice to do so.  I found it hard to follow and unintelligible in spots.  However, it could be my own understanding of it also.  This kind of book is similar to other esoteric teachings like the Rosicrucian handbook.  It really is for advanced readers and thinkers.  I suppose that leaves me out.  So, if you are into esoteric teachings with a twist, then by all means get this book.  However, I warn you that it might seem like gibberish to the uneducated and unenlightened (like myself).  Peace... 
 I had to purchase this book for my Lighting Design Course as a part of my M. Arch program, and this book has done more to confuse me than to help me.  The editing is excruciatingly bad, all of the chapters ramble on and repeat themselves constantly, and it is missing at least one crucial element--an explanation of how to diagram lighting layouts and control systems.  Do yourself a favor, and find a different book 
 With the possible exception of The Stand, Mick Garris has never made a good film (Desperation was AWWWWFUL!!!). Chocolate is no exception. After a promising beginning portion it quickly fizzles out into nothing land, giving no surprisings, no thrills, and amounting to nothing of any interest. The story is quite terrible and uninteresting, and reminded me of something a sixteen-year old would write. Its resolution is extremely unsatisfying. This is easily the worst of the Masters of Horror series that I've seen. 
 I never thought much of Dickey Betts as a singer or songwriter - he sings with no emotion, doesn't project, and generally sounds bored (he also misses every note, but so do I when I sing so I can't criticize him on that count). and as a guitarist, he's good but simply wasn't in Duane's league. SO I was more than a little disappointed when I saw how much power Dickey had over the group, and what they would've done with this material had Duane been alive. For instance, take the annoying, breezy Ramblin' Man, a smash hit and one of the weaker songs on this record. Then imagine it as passionate and strong, sort of like Midnight Rider before it.  And if Duane had been alive to add his amazing slide guitar, Southbound would've been so much better... In reality, there are only two songs worth listening to on this album. Instrumental Jessica has a nice melody, it can't compare to Dickey's classic In Memory of Elizabeth Reed but not much can. Wasted Words is the other, and even that loses points thanks to Dickey on vocals. If you must own it, I won't try to stop you, but they made better albums. Oh, and you can get to the two best songs on A Decade of Hits, too. Recommended Allman listening instead of this one: The debut, Idlewild South, At Fillmore East and Eat a Peach, four records that belong in any rock collection 
 It pained me to sit through this movie and I would have turned it off after the first ten minutes if I didn't have to write a comparative analysis between it and Shakespeare's "Othello." The writing is terrible, the acting is so-so, the music is the pits, there is WAY too much emphasis on race, and the relationship between Odin and Desi is a joke. I'm supposed to believe he went stark-raving mad over a girl he had been dating for four months? Give me a break--I ended up laughing through the majority of this movie simply because it was so bad. This is teenaged melodrama at its worst 
 While I can't agree with the other reviewer RE the quality of the 560 jeans (it seems excellent to me, having owned six pairs over the last two years, which I wear to work every day), and certainly as men's jeans, I don't think they're "out of style", I do have to say Amazon's price on this item is far, far out-of-line.  You can find these same jeans online elsewhere for $38 (with free or cheap shipping), meaning the cost is nearly $20 less than what Amazon is charging 
 I bought this for our daughter and decided to open it, apply the stickers, and put the tools in a little travel bag before wrapping it up for Christmas.  I'm very glad I did, because I'll have time to return it now and get her something else!    1.  The end-door (yellow) will not stay closed.  It falls out, it falls in.    2.  The syringe looks cute until you pick it up.  Because it gets wider at the back, the plunger will not stay in it - it just drops right out.  Also, the hole which would normally be at the tip is placed on the side.  ?!  3.  The tools really do need a bag.  If that were the only problem, I had the solution by using a small travel bag.  4.  There is nothing to tell where the stickers go.  I looked at the wrap-around packaging to figure it out, but had two stickers left over.  I examined all of the toys themselves for clues, but ended up throwing the extra stickers away.  5.  There is a little clipboard and an unsharpened pencil.  The pencil does not stay in the clipboard's pencil "holder."    Do NOT buy this set!  Buy a stuffed animal and a regular play-doctor kit.  You could even buy a real (small) pet cage at a pet store!  
 For the price that Linksys charge this adapter is a can-do-without.  Priced at 40 bucks, you can buy yourself a way better card.  I already had a pc card (an airlink wireless g one $13) but this card was put on sale at staples for 5 bucks, without rebates.  If you see this deal again and your network is wireless-b, I say go for it.  Being so expensive elsewhere, I thought I'd go for it as a backup, or a main one if the quality is near its price (my network was -b so the -g from airlink was not needed).  It was worth five dollars, but no where near 40 or even 20.  When upstairs connecting to my downstairs network, the signal was poor or good at 2 bars, while my airlink could go at 4 bars without very good signal and fast speed.  The speed was not needed for internet because my dsl only goes 1.5 mbs, but I transfer large files through my laptop, mostly vids, and the slowness was just not tolerable.  Plus, I thought that this card could go on linux and run airsnort, but this failed me too.  For five dollars, this may be a worthy investment for connectivity, but if you buy it for anywhere near what other stores are selling it for, you should go back, demand a refund, and slap the spit on the salesmen ;) 
 I have usually enjoyed this series since the first title was released. As time goes on, I find myself waiting longer to read these books. They just aren't a "must read" any more.  Like: The humor! No one does this aspect as well.       The mystery, when it is actually a mystery.       Her friends - what an amazing assortment of characters.    Dislike: The whining. Its more than time for Eve to face up to her past - or not. just do it one way or the other. Other people (in real life) with much less going for them (supportive spouse & friends, job, respect and so on) have managed to face thier pasts in a healthier way than Eve. I do tire of reading about the horrific abuse in every book. Isn't it time for Roarke to use his influence and find her parents? We all know the man she killed wasn't really her father, right? She has to be a much-missed child from good parents.         The sex. Perhaps some people read Robb for the sex scenes but they bore me. I find they bring the series down rather than elevating it. These scenes I skip and its easy to do since, once they start, they invariably take up the rest of the chapter. Why not leave these scenes to the heavy-breathing historical type stuff she writes?         Love Roarke but dislike that we have to always hear what a bad boy he was. This book kind of moved away from that. Kind of.   Overall, its just time for the main characters to grow up and stop sniveling. There are people out there in the world with ever so much less than either one of them have who managed to overcome. Why not make these characters like that?  Oh, and what is with the "stand for"? Someone is always standing for someone. Its written in such a way I just know that no one would ever really talk like that. And its said much too often. She has used that phrase in other books as well (& other series). Perhaps she does know people who speak like that, but I have yet to meet one. Sometimes her characters come across as almost comic when she places words in their mouths that just aren't thiers.  All that said, I honestly do enjoy Robb, but for the mystery and the humor and the relationships. The cop work is usually good, but its been missing. Basically, I could do without all the sex (some romance is lovely) and truly appreciate a good detective story written by a talented woman. 
 This is far from a 4 or 5 start outing.  However there is the stand out track "I finally know".  I play this one several times in a row when it comes ont my mp3 player.  Too bad the rest of the CD wasn't this good.  
 The thing I hate about this is cleaning out the grounds..the easy way is rinsing it out in the sink, however it's no good to have all these going through your garbage disposal. Otherwise it was a great idea 
 When I realized early on the time I would waste on this assemblage of leftover quips packaged around a absurd concept, I resolved that I would alert other readers.   Generally I enjoy this author's works and anticipated this latest tome. I was surprised and dissappointed to find a lengthy novel which did nothing to disguise it's clues or probable developments. Everything was telegraphed and nothing was original. The conclusion was so lame that I was shocked that there was no effort to build suspense or intrigue.  My advice is to skip this one and wait for the reviews on his next 
 There are only three books I've ever wanted to throw in the trash. This book is one of them. Schlesinger runs up and down the decades, around the nation, and across the list of characters in a disorganized frenetic movement that reminds me of nothing so much as my hyperactive, attention deficit disordered son during Saturday morning cartoons. One moment he's writing about Hamilton in the revolution, the next he's discoursing on Jackson's death. I picked this book up on the remainder shelf. I wish it had remained there 
 Google the words Foster Cline and Attachment Therapy, and be prepared to lose your lunch. Happy research 
 This isn't just a romance.  It's worse.  Take a generic romance novel, with lame characters, and meld it with an episode of the old Knight Rider television show, and you've got it.  How and why could an author capable of the humor and wisdom that we see in the Stephanie Plum books, put her name on a book like this? 
 I have read literally every book written on serial and sexually motivated murder and this is by far the worst.   This book starts with an admission by the writer that he knows nothing about the subject and has learned everything he knows just like the reader. Bad omen. He then proceeds with the rambling tale of how he thinks he has bumped into two different serial murderers in his life and that seems to be the motivation to write this book.   So then, the book begins. He seems antagonistic at best when referencing the work of experts in the field such as the Behavioral Sciences Unit at Quantico, disputing statistics compiled by people who have, by his own admission, more experience than he does.   The crime accounts are no better than what you could read in the news reports of these cases. As an example it includes an account of the London Moster who was a man that stabbed women but never killed anyone, which is piquerism not serial homicide. never focused or on track this book is all over the place and a very amatuerish work.   I highly recommend that you buy another book such as Hunting Humans, or The Criminal Min 
 one of the worst Van Damme movies of all time, this one and Derailed and Replicant and Knock Off, come of Van Damme baby, make good ones and have good directors too. this one has Van Damme after Mickey Rourke who Rourke ends up killing him or he thinks he killed him, then Van Damme goes to an island of lost dead agents and villians(corny). he escapes retardedly and then goes back to save his wife and his up and coming child(who Van Damme and Rodman almost indanger the poor kid, bastards). Van Damme gets help from puke and choke Rodman and they have awesome adventures and eat lots of candy, no wait, thats what I was thinking and then, no. but there's some, I SAID SOME, good action, but then it dies and sits there. the end with an oiled up shirtless Rourke and the tiger lets the suspense and action down. strickly for fans of the movies Van Damme was crappy in. this is repuked up snot on a seseame seed bu 
 I know that it takes talent to make music, and I hate to criticize any musicians because I certainly couldn't do it, but this CD was just not that good. There are some cool beats, but they're pretty forgettable. Lyrics in electronic music aren't always deep or anything, but in some cases, I think she actually was trying to make a "real song", so it was kind of sad. Her vocals are Madonna-esque, without the smooth production. Maybe she just didn't quite live up to the hype. I'm beginning to think that most female djs "make it" just because of the novelty of female djs. There was nothing to HATE, but there certainly wasn't anything to love, either 
 Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked 
 Part of the work involved in writing is editing. Through editing, a writer -or editor if the writer does not do his/her own editing- can eliminate any word that is not essential to the text, minimizing the amount of text required to express the author's ideas. I believe Hemingway wrote about this and how he applied it to his work. In the case of Glickman's book I became bored rather quickly given that she took too many pages to express the same ideas and concepts. It's not that the idea is a bad one, but I don't think that the book is "The Best it can be." It is written in a sub-optimal manner. I purchased the book based on the glowing reviews, and on the comments by respected authors such as Covey, Blanchard, et. al. De Bono's comment seems to be focused on Thinking, not Optimal Thinking, though. While I'm glad the book is appreciated by many people, famous or not, it is certainly not for me. I gave it away and hopefully it will work for the recipient of the book. For me it was boring, repetitive, and disappointing after reading so much praise. I have a lot of material to read, and need to optimize the way I invest my time. In a sense, after the first couple of chapters, I felt I was wasting my time reading this book. I wish I had found Steve Pavlina's brief review prior to purchasing Optimal Thinking. I will give it 2 stars because it does contain useful ideas. I don't think so many pages are required to express these ideas 
 If Amazon had a Half Star, or better yet, a No Star rating I would have used the latter. Powers spends the first seven pages talking about his pimple dilemma then goes on to his tediously constructed random subjects with shallow character development laced with corny humor. I get the feeling throughout the book of the author's desperate attempt to be funny. 
 There's something about Alex McKnight that resonates with me.  Maybe it's his bad attitude.  Maybe it's his sarcasm.  Or maybe it's that in the end, he's a sucker like me.  In this outing, author Steve Hamilton takes on a ride through Alex's past.  Through the streets of Detroit, Alex and his old friend, Randy Wilkins, are off on a crazy search for a girl Randy knew when he played for the Tigers.  When Randy gets shot, Alex tenaciously searches for answers.  The plot falls short because the set-up isn't that believable and the ending is too abrupt.  Furthermore, Randy's personality is quite annoying.  I'm glad he got shot.  An enjoyable read, but not Hamilton's best.      
 This novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries.  In between the entertainment biz cliches, the author can only think to put various assination hits.  some of the characters are interesting but not believable, and they  certainly can't make up for the braindead plot.  Read some of his other novels and skip this one 
 I ordered this product almost two weeks ago and it is not even shipped yet 
 After making cold process soap for several several years, and working in product development for a major soap company, I must say that this book is interesting, but not very practical and certainly confusing.  I suppose I need more science to really understand this process.  I found the soap to be very drying, with a "fat" smell that was really hard to cover.  Also, the shelf life was not very long.  
 Did not like the book. The author is overly verbose and redundant. I want to sell it on Amazon someone may love it 
 I LOVE this movie I've seen it probably more than 100 times! So imagine how excited I was to see it for like 5 bucks at Wal-Mart.... this particular copy is sitting next to me right now and all can say is I was really mad when I sat and watched it, the editing is horrible there are times when the camera zooms on people it shouldn't, lines are cut out and sometimes there are voices but no one's lips are moving.  Buy the authorized version not this one this one sucks 
 Let's start with the good things about this book.  It has extensive quotes from no less than 67 documents that are relevant to the conflict, along with five tables, two charts, and 23 maps.  And it does supply plenty of facts.  But this book completely misses the big picture, partially due to bias and partially due to poor scholarship.  Absurdly irrelevant events, such as Arafat saying (for the thirtieth time) that he might do something to promote peace, are given star treatment when they deserve no mention at all.  Major aspects of the conflict, such as the training of a generation of Arabs to be nihilistic antisemites, get little attention.  It is taken for granted that small details about borders are the main issues: the possibility that the fight is over something as fundamental as human rights is discounted.  The authors explicitly realize that the task of the historian is to determine truth, explain it, weed out lies, infer as yet unknown details, and predict the future.  They simply fail in that task.  Not only do they implicitly accept many manifest fabrications (only to take out their suspicions on those who ought not be mistrusted without good cause), they often fail to distinguish between errors of judgment and outright malice.  It is sad to see such problems with what could have been a far more useful reference. 
 In spite of the gallant efforts of Michelle Greene and Erica Shaffer, this thing is a bomb! Helen Lesnick thinks way too highly of herself (that she has written a good story, that she can pass for 34 and that she can act!) and she drags the movie right into the trash can along with her "talent". Sorry but the truth hurts. Don't waste your money; instead, try "Fingersmith" for a well written story and well developed characters. 
 I spent the last 3 hours trying to get support for this product. Although the site did not reject me it sent me through loops to get an "update" that when run, errored out as soon as it began 
 I just listened to the whole record on AOL Listening Party. There's no doubt this record will be heralded as the best McCartney record since Band On The Run, but what's really up with Paul is every record is worse than the last.    As far as I can tell every tune had a fragmant of an idea behind it, which was then turned into a tune in the studio.  By the time the bridge arrives, McCartney is hacking out uninspired chord progessions layered with horrible, clumsy lyrics.   I feel sorry for the guy from Radiohead.  He must be dreading the diplomatic reviews he is sure to recieve from artists he has done good work with 
 There is no such entity as an addictive personalty . Often  the author belittiles ,  mocks   and  discounts what a substance Abuser  says .  Few are truely  in denail as they are seeking help , what denial really means is that the person disagrees with the 12 step counslers version of thier life and problems .  What the non medical term Dry drunk means is a person is  not using   or moderateing with out the help of a 12 step program   The reality is most people quit or moderate on thier own with out the religiious gibberish  of a 12 step program that many    have begun to veiw as a  dangerous cult   Please   seek other advice based  on emprically   reviewed science not  ancetdotal     nonsense dreged  on out dated relgious  dogma .  12 step treatment is nothing more than faith healing and the last time "denial " was used as  evidnece    of something was during the witch craft trails in te 16,00s . It is now 2006 we can do alot better than this.   
 This novel is narrated by a senior at an exclusive boys' boarding school, portrayed as the type of place where all of the students are hiding their true selves.  Those who are wealthy try desperately to hide that fact, and those who are on scholarship, as is the narrator, try even harder to hide their heritage.  As this story is told from the point of view of one character, it is impossible to determine if this is actually true, or if his fear of being exposed as a fraud clouds his vision of everyone else.  It is hard for me to believe that these boys are so disconnected from each other.  According to the narrator, nobody is really friends with anybody else, despite the fact that they have been living with each other for so many years.  No student has any real relationship with any other student.  What is real, is literature.  Writers are artists, who form their own social club and are therefore able to escape the boxes into which their heritage has forced them.  It seems every boy at school aspires to write, and once every semester the class is rewarded with a visit from a famous author.  These visits are paired with writing contests, in which boys submit a piece of writing in the style of the famous author.  The student whose writing is chosen by the visiting author is rewarded with a private audience with him or her--an unbelievable honor for the student.  The narrator of the book is desperate for one of these audiences, and devastated when his opportunity to interact with Robert Frost and Ayn Rand passes him by.  When he finds that Ernest Hemingway is to be the next visiting author, he is willing to do anything, even plagiarize a story he comes across in a literary magazine, to meet the famous man.  Some of the parts of this story are interesting, especially those focused on the visiting authors.  I particularly liked the passages about Ayn Rand and was delighted when a boy asked her, quite seriously, "Who is John Galt?" and received nothing but looks of utter loathing in response.  I also liked the responses of the authors to the works of the students.  The boys submitted very earnest bits of poetry or fiction that were terribly misinterpreted by the authors who judged them and read much more into them than the boys had ever anticipated or expected.  However, I didn't really connect with any of the characters, perhaps because the narrator of the story never got close to anyone.  He talks about his roommate and how the two of them lived together for years and kept seeming like they might become friends, but it never really happened.  In fact, the narrator, although friendly with many, seems to have no actual friends.  There is only one girl who might be a love interest in the story, but the narrator also has only minimal feelings for her.  In the end, this lack of interest for anyone in the story left me feeling rather uninterested in everything, as well. 
 When Bob Clark gave us the original back in the 75 and threw a young Margot Kidder in as a boozing sorority sister who along with the rest are being terrorized by a killer living upstairs in the attic his intentions were to give us a scary movie and not much blood.As a result it worked for the most part.Oh before I forget, Rest in peace Bob Clark.He died at 67 in a head on which also killed his son last week.This version directed by Glen Morgan brings gore and eye balls popping out every chance he gets.Hey there's even a scene where an icicle falls off the roof and pierces through Andrea Martin head.Its laughable! She would of had a better death if she let the killer did it.The acting is so-so but nothing worth noting.They're spoiled girls and very vulgar when they speak.You'll probably do what I did after a while and root for the killer 
 Okay, I normally don't believe in giving bad feedback on an item, but this is one that just isn't worth it. Unless you live in a dance studio, there's no way you can learn this. Also, this is nothing like the dances done at the country clubs. 
  Conason organizes chapters so each "revenges" (hallucinatory liberals' embellishment!) allegedly smearing accusations conservatives fling towards liberals. Displeasingly, this plan's appreciable from strict, coherence stndpoints. Conason's tone isn't as infernal in his monstrously devious cunning as his demeaningly liberal peers, who're ALL hazardously untamed in Bush-antagonism. Shyster Conason's still unforgivable in his slanderous pollutedness of scornfully branding rightists, when he defrauded in his unholy Introduction that his tripe WOULDN'T be narrow-mindedly adverse, like his ostracized peers'!!!! In Ch.7, dissuasively, his furious, up-to-then secretive partiality rears its UGLY head and savages ANY remediableness his "work" has of being reasonable.  Although Ch.8-10 are vilest, treachery in Conason's disrespectable "arguments" materializes. Conason stoops to untrustworthiness in his Introduction, when he incompetently forges that liberals are majority by misusing poll results regarding universal healthcare!!!! Conason vindictively neglects mentioning those biased "polls" occur ONLY during adverse economies, like polls last fall showed because of the economy's unprogressive downturn-which HAS rebounded.  Ch.1's depraved argument's flimsy. Conason dictates indiscriminately ALL CEOs are conservative prostitutes whose tax interests are subserved by the WH. Besides underhandedly admitting the conservative derogation of liberal disenfranchisement in business management, Conason's tarnish is fallaciously based. Assuming the WH crafts tax policy in CEOs' interests, this isn't necessarily alarming, as Conason combatively terrorizes. Refunds and write-offs for corporations are factually good, since this helps income. With expanding earnings, corporations will GLARINGLY hire to complement growth, employing Americans!!!! Provided you're liberal, you'll wrongfully find this blasphemous, which WILL reflect on you as undereducated.  Conason homicidally exaggerates choice facts, relentlessly prejudiced to liberal stubbornness. In Ch.2, he mishandles questionable "evidence" falsifying the LIBERAL MEDIA's conservative slant. Conason selectively seizes one unverifiable source, Editor & Publisher, to sinisterly further agendas of assumingly claiming conservative slant in media. What Conason hides is that survey involved opinions of editors/publishers regarding who they'd think would win 2000's election. Since most-indiscriminatingly-believed Bush, they were inclined to proclaim him since they realized the Gore-alternative was bleak. Conason fabricates upon embellishing that editors voted for Bush. A NARROW margin voted Bush. Conason conceals that survey asked said editors/publishers if they felt there was biased coverage. 80% of 25% who responded affirmative professed there was GORE BIAS. In another mistreated "source", Gannett newspapers, Conason bestially deceives their papers shifted towards right-wing endorsement despite their relative liberality. Before 2000's election, 13 papers turned Republican, so OF COURSE Bush's endorsements incremented, with the resulting discrimination of 41-votes-for-Gore to 37-votes-for-Bush still being worse Demoncratic prejudice.  Ch.3's idea's unlawful. Conason's the malcontent gall to mutiny against verifiable mantras of conservatives denigrating liberals traitorous!!!! All one's to do is bloodcurdlingly inspect Demoncrats' reactions to terrorism. They've bitched about "civil liberties" sacked by Ashcroft, Iraq's cost, keeping troops there necessarily, giving grants to Iraq, and American intervention to neutralize Iraqi terrorist and nuclear threats-even AFTER voting FOR war!!!! Not to mention Clinton's imposition of the "Torricelli `Principle'". Conason's amoralities descend further when he brutalizes conservatives for libeling Clinton the "draft dodger" he was. Conason encroachingly errs that Clinton's dastardly choice to evade Vietnam was acceptable due to his "disbelief" to war, while liberals tarnish Bush for his reasons of joining the National Guard, which at least was SERVICE!!!! Conason mendaciously involves secondary tactics of relying on filthily circumstantial examples when he plots to implicate conservatives as cowardly for avoiding Vietnam because of medical reasons. Conason abysmally covers-up HOWIERD Dean's ski-trip orgy after getting deferment from Vietnam!!!!  Ch.4 uses subterfuge in oppressively aggrandizing Clinton's "quite impressive" economical record, citing 4% unemployment, 22,000,000 "jobs" "created", and rising income. Conason mustn't fiercely scold Bush: Bush's 2003 tax-relief-the benefactor of 8% year-end GDP and 20-year high consumer confidence-is PRECISELY THE reason defamers like Conason shouldn't prematurely manufacture slurring in September, because he's dishonored now!!!! Clinton oversaw 350,000 INITIAL CLAIMS in January 20, 2001 (leftovers from Clinton's policies), and his "bullish" economy was shattered by calamitous ruination in markets, and high interest rates by 2000's end. Out of those 22,000,000 "created" "jobs", 92% were private-sector, forebodingly in unstable tech start-ups which contributed mostly to the markets' collapses. Because of the recession's length, interest rates under Bush culminated in 2002's record year for home sales-the strongest economic part which curbed the recession.  From Ch.7-10, inconsistencies become falsification!!!! In Ch.7, Conason preys on discriminatory, isolated incidents in Republicans' demeanors to fake "proof" of conservatives' immoralities. In Ch.8, Conason arraigns Bush's family as misconducting "Crony Capitalism", despite it applying to BACKWATERS whose dictators distribute favoring deals to friends. Bush's appointments are properly classified as nepotism. In Ch.9, Conason partially seizes thin connections of Bush to a "fundamentalist"-conservative professor, because Bush introduced his book, to frailly convict Bush of failing "compassionate conservatism". Ch.10's incontestably THE most ludicrous of Conason's uncleanliness. He bleakly invents Clinton was proactive against terrorism!!!! BWAHAHAHA!!! 
 First of all, yes, this film was made in Vancouver, with only a few shots of the Manhattan skyline. When Golden Harvest was making this film, they had to try their best to shoot at angles that didn't show any mountains, and they had to paint grafitti each day and unpaint it each night. Then Jackie Chan told them to simply forget all of that and focus on the action.  Well, action was what they focused on the most indeed. It sure is funny to see how the Chinese thought of the United States at this time, because what you see in this film are hippies that drive around in trucks full of beach balls. You also get multi-ethnic gangs trashing places (seriously, the gang has a Native American with pigtails and a frayed jacket! That's almost offensive). You have fat cops that just sit around smoking cigars. You have random, small-crowd rock concerts where everyone is dressed up in animal suits! Bizarre indeed.  As for the actions, this film has some of his best. The first fight scene in the grocery store is supurb, and graceful, using his jacket to dispatch enemies, and endlessly hitting the same guy in the nose over and over. He takes on the entire gang in a back alley before getting cornered, very impressive. This leads to a scene where he's being chased around the streets of New York, where the entire gang, on motor cycles, try to run him over, and Jackie must rely on his ability to run like the wind and climb like a monkey. He also does a dangerous stunt where he jumps from the roof of a parking garage onto a fire escape of another building. No harness or wiresupport! The fight scene at the gang's hideout is also one his best, using whatever object he can get his hands ont, and very acrobatic. Also, Jackie Chan has to cling to a hovercraft while it drives on water and land! Some of this was done on a broken ankle!  If this DVD was uncut and undubbed, and had the original score, I'd give it a total of three stars. Unfortunately, for a so-so film, New Line makes it worse. Some of the dubbing is very bad. It seems as if New Line dubbed some of the original English dialouge also. Only very, very little of the original Cantonese dialouge is there. Also, the film's original score has been redone to a more orchestrated score with slight rock. Many, many scenes were cut from the original movie. Not only that, but some of the action scenes were cut too.   Try and find an uncut version out there. This DVD you should stay away from 
 If you like neurotic self-involved women who never know how to gain control of their lives, this book is for you.  If not, just pass this by. I know she won all kinds of awards from her other books, but this is full of whining and self-pitty. In fact it feels so thin it feels like the notes she took for the article she wrote for a magazine. I couldn't even get past the first section and I'm a huge reader 
 Walter Mosley, like too many mainstream and mystery writers, appears to believe that "science fiction" means "logic and plausibility get tossed out the window." That the official Amazon.com review compares this book to the work of Philip K. Dick is amazing and wrong-headed; Dick knew how to ground his surrealism in the real world and especially in real human beings. Whatever Mr. Mosley does in his mysteries and mainstream fiction, that's not what he's doing here 
 She was such a cool voice on the new age scene.  Not one of my favorites but she clearly pulled her own.  How did she suddenly leave the world of believing thought creates reality and we are one with Spirit to believing in the Presiden Bush cartoon of evil doers and evil forces and an external child like belief in a separate God on a throne above the clouds.  It was kind of sad to read, like reading the journal of someone having a nervous breakdown.  Most people's breakdowns don't get published though.  Hopefully someone close to her will reach out and help her see the beauty of who she really is and there is nothing to fear "out there" from the "others" or the "evil doers."  Luckily, the "others" are just parts of us that we can work though not some boogie man force in Star Wars. Maybe she will get sober again and see that.  It may be hard to realize who you are and have faith in the Divine when you are under the influence.  
 For good or bad there are certain things one comes to expect when watching animes especially after watching them for many years. Surely the avid anime enthusiast would like to see more and more serious anime films, but at the same time they'd like an anime feel to their films... what's most important though is whether or not the film is intriguing, creative, and powerful. This film fails short of all of those things and instead pretends to be something it isn't.  This didn't have an anime feel... which wasn't really a problem for me - I've seen a number of anime movies which were serious, but this movie was - in my opinion - about as horrible as they come.   Trying to show itself off as a feel good anime film about Christmas (how many damn Christmas-happy movies do we have out there?), this anime follows the same premise as thousands of films before it and fails in the face of them. "A Christmas Story" and all of those films far surpass both the quality and thematic/story-delivery found within Tokyo Godfathers.   Are we supposed to like it because these themes are found within a Japanese animation? I doubt anyone could really say that the visuals were great (they were not, but that's beside the point since visuals aren't all that matters), I doubt anyone can even say this film was really all that original (the only thing semi-original about it is the cast of "odd fellow" characters like the street bum with the heart of gold who wants nothing more than to have a child of her own... except she is a transvestite, really a man).   I feel really bad about posting this review considering so many people enjoyed it, but I can only guess that they haven't watched very many Christmas movies in the past or that they have little to no capacity for judging films accurately.  The director however is one of my favorite - I deeply enjoyed Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress is perhaps my favorite anime movie ever made - after watching this movie though I'm kind of disappointed that fans of decided to "cling" onto this movie and call it a classic when in reality it mimics half a dozen non-animated titles and brings nothing new or intriguing to the table.   Furuya was successful in taking a bland film, creating such a big hype over it by attaching his renowned name to it and putting a child in it and some heart breaking tales already told time and again. The audience bought it up... too bad. You don't need to feel ashamed to say it really isn't as special as it tries to present itself as.   Oh well, perhaps you really need to be a hardcore sentimentalist to like this film. Here is the film's ultra-negative review by an informed reviewer... I sincerely hope people take my words into consideration not merely rate this as "unhelpful" because they disagree with it (then again, that's the style on Amazon these days isn't it?) 
 What Fat possum did to this album really blows!!  Tracks like "I got a friend" start out with a nice southern delta blues sound and then out of nowhere it turns into porn music.  The audio effects and computerized editing really messed up the original sound of Asie Payton 
 I have found that this cable does not fit snugly to maintain a good connection. It tends to wiggle part of the way out rather easily.  The zip cord function is disappointing.  It worked for a little while, but it didn't take long for it not to function properly.  After only a few uses it doesn't roll all the way back up nor does it want to stay unrolled most of the time.  
 Robin Hobb knows how to write well and proved it with Assassin's Apprentice. Unfortunately, she seems to be in love with her descriptive prose and forgets mundane items such as plot, action, and likable (or at least interesting) characters. Ship of Magic suffers from an excess of flowery prose adorning a dull, meandering story containing uninteresting and mostly unlikable characters. I read a quarter of the book and stopped. Some of the (mostly glowing) reviews claim that the book gets better, but my patience dwindled to naught.  Specific things I disliked:  1. Another Hobb book in which magic but inanimate objects (the wood of the liveship) come to life only after multiple people (three generations of ship owners, in this book) die while touching the object. Can't her magic creatures have lives and personalities of their own?  2. Teens and young adults rarely learn from mistakes and repeatedly act stupid. (Maybe they are all budding politicians.)  3. The interwoven story of sea serpents from some other plane of existence is distracting because of lack of context. It probably will make sense later, but it adds nothing but confusion in the early chapters. Hobb should have started the book at the middle or near-end of the story (so we would know the importance of the serpents and the liveships) and then gone back in time.  4. The members of the main family are mostly unlikable. The only likable one has unrealistic lines: the 13-year-old acolyte talks like a 50-year-old philosopher 
 The conclusions the author reaches are hardly substantiated by the historical record.  While he writes intelligently, he does not know his subject very well.  It is almost as if he were an expert in another area, but was forced to write a book outside his area of expertise.  One of the few books I've read where I alternated at being mad about the ineptness of the historical conclusions drawn, and laughing at the absurdness of the same conclusions.  Truly a miss 
 I read "Veronica Decides to Die", after reading "The Alchemist," "Eleven Minutes," and "The Zahir." The previous two I enjoyed tremendously, even through "The Alchemist" didn't strike me as original and groundbreaking as the people that recommended it to me had described it. Had I not had such high expectations, perhaps, reading it would have been more rewarding of an experience. Getting to the point, "Veronica Decides to Die" is yet another novel where he's reinforcing the theme that rules all of his books, the importance of appreciating life and treasuring each moment in life as the precious gift it is. It gets tedious at times, and I won't be the first to point out that the incessant borrowing of ideas is another obvious shortcoming. He introduces psychological disorders as a sort of a rebellion against society, as always, over-simplifying things in order to draw the reader to the "natural" philosophical conclusion. The problem is, this time Coelho doesn't quite succeed. 
 I bought this book to understand basics and fundementals , it's quite organized and has a lot of info. in it , but you must have a good background to keep on reading and even you must have a lot of refrences to go back to while reading this book, at the first chapters there are instants that you need to go to chapter 16 to read then come back, I say this book is wonderfull if you have a good solid background ( mathematically and numericaly in Video standers and transforms... ) 
 Hmmm, 90% of reviewers are in or finishing Phase I...and the rest are in Phase II... Where are the people who have been on this beyond Phase III?  I'm VERY suspect of a diet that shows only initial success... I can show you a multitude of diets that will make pounds 'melt' off in the first 2 weeks...but it's the LONG term that's important! A program like Body for Life is great this way! I'll wait for 4+ month advocates before I recommend this book 
 The book may be entertaining to read because of the way Mankiw sets his examples. Unfortunately what we have in our hands is the same irrealistic exposition of how the economy works that has been dominating university curriculums from the first day Adam Smith was appointed at Glasgow. As an example I may cite my personal experience as a teaching assistant. When explaining the comparative advantage theory I obviously gave the Ricardian demonstration of the theory. But when I wanted to treat the absolute advantage theory, Marx's name was nowhere to be found. Even Samuelson devoted some pages to Marx's contribution to economic theory. President Bush's economic advisor seems to lack objective exposition when dealing with basic economic theories. I don't consider myself to be paranoid, but the economics curriculum, and it's instruments, such as this book, only serve a mode of reproduction of the dominant ideology, which we all know has lots of contradictions that everyday spring up in everybody's life. It is time to bring to the market a more balanced exposition of the various tendencies within economics, even if the course is described as being introductory. Most of the people who take these basic courses don't even know that there are alternative paradigms. They just finish their Mankiw's as if nothing else could be thought about how the economy really works 
 This is cute- but, it's not as good as Brown Bear. The words don't just roll off your tongue like Brown Bear. I don't find it as "catchy". 
 this was the same literature but not the book that was pictured on amazon website.  very old version and took forever to get here 
 All sane people agree that The Jam was huge on so many levels. I don't care what anyone else says, The Style Council was Weller's creative apex (most people don't appreciate truly good food either). Wildwood is perhaps the best of Weller's solo material but c'mon, it's a shell of his former brilliance. So much of it is generic and forgettable. I saw him live in LA this summer and it was fine, but the creative well of new material is dry 
 I am sorry that this book does not seem very useful to me.  This text is highly recommended by noted authorities in woodworking.  Much of the information seems very dated.  Other areas, such as descriptions of joints and specific types of dovetails seem to be too limited to be of use to a novice like myself.  I feel I wasted money on this purchase and I wish I could see the value that much better craftsman than myself place on it 
 I know that everyone wants to hear how great a movie is.  Well, I can't say The Thin Red Line is a great movie.  On a scale of 1-5 I gave it a 2.    Maybe my expectations were too high.  After all, I bought this movie after watching Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, and A Bridge Too Far.  So, I was expecting The Thin Red Line to be on that level.  After all, with 7 Academy Award Nominations including Best Picture, a cast that includes many of the top names in Hollywood, and a huge budget, the bar was set pretty high.  And I guess if you're into artsy, "message" films The Thin Red Line will be what you're looking for.  But, if you're looking for a "war" movie you can forget it.  Buy When Trumpets Fade or Saving Private Ryan if you're looking for action.  Or better yet, splurge for the Band of Brothers set.  You'll seldom make such a wise investment if you're really interested in knowing what happened.  I'm just not interested in watching a World War 2 movie that appears more interested in all this sort of introspective business.  Save that for Dr. Phil.  I've warned you.  If you're into history and World War 2 in particular, rent this before you buy it.  Seriously. 
 Datlow & Windling's backpatting of personal acquaintances is the basis of their editorial choices, and adherence to political doctrine. Their "years best"  collection for 2000 includes Ursula Le Guin twice,  and this authors writing is little more then fanciful icing to make her  de-hydrated cause (feminism in this case) more palatable 
 It says a lot when a young band's debut album is copy-protected. The record company seems to broadcast to the entire world that Kasabian are the next big thing, so you better get in line and BUY the thing now. Thanks to my local library, I found out the real reason for slapping a copy-protection on this album thereby moving more units: Kasabian are lame.  We are now officially in the 21st century. And as a listening audience, we're hard-pressed to be taken by brat rock anymore. Yeah, Kasabian have an attitude. They mouth off about other rock stars, good for them. They also play innocuous, vanilla brit-pop that takes a simplistic, single idea and drives it into the ground. After listening to this label-guarded turkey, these are the only merits that come to mind for these guys.  It's all getting to be a bit much. Every couple of months and we're treated to another juvenile band from the UK who think they can dominate the world by singing about 'gihls.' Between this and the Artic Monkeys, when will it cease? Where have you gone, Blur?  Even if this didn't have a copy-protection on it, I don't consider it to be CDR worthy 
 I wish I hadn't wasted seven years of my life reading this absurd book. Initially, it even prompted me to join the Trappist Order which resulted in serious psychological damage that I am STILL working through. I'll say this  though; there should definitely be a screenplay because while the book does  not effectively translate from the page I can see how Kurt Russel could  bring to life so many of these saints to the big screen. I'd pay to see  that flick, wouldn't you? Anyway, dont' read this book unless you have some  sort of serious complex involving a deep desire for some self-flaggelation 
 I just saw this toy in Parents Magazine Sunday night and was so excited to see it on sale at Target this week. I ran to get it since my [...] son is too short to use his hand-me-down red tricycle. It looked like lots of fun in the picture, however, my son is too big for it! I don't know why it states that it is suitable for up to 3 years old- no way! If it were adjustable, I'm sure he would have loved it, but just like another reviewer stated- it's just like the other ride-on toys we already own. Currently, the Scuttle Bug is in the trunk ready to be returned to the store. How disappointing 
 a tired bit of revisionist propaganda out of post-soviet russia which somehow won an oscar as best foreign film.  its fascinating that something so heavy handed can pretend to be an answer to the vile excesses of the stalin era, but what can one expect?  there is (at least one) great movie to be made about that era; dont look for it here. 
 This book is nothing more than telling you things you already know (eg: weather forcasts are not accurate, you cannot predict the stock market ect). The author does not provide any rational, framework or theory for why these things can be fortold other than some vauge references to chaos and some politically correct references to the Santa Fe Institute.  A real disappointment; it is written more like a newpaper narrative of what is rather than an analysis of why it is or what it should be.  I was particularly dismayed since this book was an Amazon recommendation for business books.  They missed the boat on this one 
 I've read a lot of Ludlum books but this book is so totally "off" in terms of technical authenticity and detail that anyone who understands a little about computers, etc. should stay away - it is just to difficult to read when you can't respect the knowledge of the authors 
 The same old stories over and over. All the "subjects" sound the same after a while.  Needs something more to keep the reader interested....disappointed.  Very factual and accurate though 
  Well after buying some of Italy's best pots or cookware...where the inside is a slick finish...not sand coated...(Le Creusant)I was hoping that someone else had come up with a pot as good or a skillet if you may...however I am disappointed in my skillet...yes it has a sandy finish or rough if you will...not what I was looking for ...it however does cook very well or fry...and does clean up easy...hey would spend a few hundred bucks to find the skillet I want ...these guys just don't have it...the wording of the skillet did not indicate a rough inside finish 
 As one of the reviewers said if you really liked MELODY AM, you might be up for a surprise here. I suggest you listen to this album very carefully before buying it.  From mellow electro of MELODY AM, they went to electro-POP with an aftertaste of the 80's for many songs in THE UNDERSTANDING.  Sometimes, I hear some sounds of Eurythmics, Depeche Mode, and others in the after-taste portion of the songs.  Music is always hard to describe, that's the best I can do.  Their songs 11-12 of THE UNDERSTANDING are probably the ones I prefer, still they're not brilliant, and #11 reminds me of AIR 
 Sontag represents a certain type of "intellectual" who is - thankfully - becoming increasingly rare in the world of google and broadband. As exemplified by Descartes (I think, therefore I am), this is the school of people who think that truth can be discovered solely through rumination - without doing any research, without experimentation, without any investigation of the world outside of your skull. It is pure subjectivity - gloriously self-referential and egotistic, completely self-contained and titannically self-satisfied. What Sontag's writings are about are Sontag - not the world as it is (and which can easily be fact checked) but the world as seen through the coke bottle lens of Sontag's ego and self. Sontag would hate the comparison but she is the leftist equivalent of the medieval christian mystic - the world outside of her own mind doesn't matter and facts have no weight. This is what enabled her - in one of the most egregious public acts of heartlessness in the last one hundred years - to praise the 9/11 terrorists for bravery while the World Trade Center was still smoldering and bodies were still being dragged from the debris. This was like praising the Nazi concentration camp managers for efficiency and thoroughness. Having distanced herself from humanity and decency with her warped and unbalanced intellect, the stunned response to her statements probably bewildered her completely. No matter as her crazed statements had plenty of precedents in her previous writings. She took the very cheap, easy, and elitist high road of condemning every wrong in the world - without ever offering any solutions and always, always, condemning the USA for actually trying to do something about these problems rather than just word process away safely in her study surrounded by the works of Verlaine, Rimbaud, and Genet.  In Photography, Sontag is at the Acme of her (witch) craft. She thinks (and enough critics seemed to have agreed with her) that a well written sentence implies veracity as if the good sentence was a litmus test for truth; as if grammar and a good thesaurus conferred reliability, sanity, or common sense. It doesn't. She'll be forgotten. I think she would have appreciated that - joining the obscure writers that few people read, enjoyed, or valued. She was too elitist to have enjoyed it very much if she actually was embraced by the masses 
 I have cashmere lined leather gloves from neiman's which i love, and wear all the time when i want to be a bit dressy in cold weather. So I was excited to find these for about 30 percent less $, as they should be for an online source (I think). However I was disappointed because the cashmere is of a poor quality, so they are  a bit rough, like regular wool. The leather is good though, so at least they look good! I have the silk lined from this source as well, and i like them, though they are not for really cold weather 
 This shredder is ok if you have 3 sheets to shred once a week.  You cannot shred sheet repeatedly.  It clogs up and is very hard to operate. 
 A dull, tedious, melodramatic effort that wastes the cast and the craft of scene setting.  Everything goes out the window once people start moving and talking and it takes hours for the story to reach the predictable non-conclusion.  The film is laden with cliches and burdened by a lack of focus.  Pick a story out of here and you can make 20 films, but don't throw together teasers and expect everyone to appreciate the slow-mo trainwreck of family tragedies that this movie encompasses 
 Viewing the internet this monitor was great. When I tried to play a movie, DVD DISC, MPEG, AVI, ANYTHING. The picture was terrible. Very bad pixilation. I was told it might be the video card. I bought a new card XFX geforce 7600 gs, for another $150.00. Same quality on films. I tried latest driver from XFX, from nvidia, etc. Changed screen resolutions, everything you could think of, I tried. The picture for viewing movies was terrible. I hooked my old 15 inch monitor back up, the picture quality for movies is great. I have returned this monitor, now I have to wait for a refund before I will try a different monitor. The black light bleed is very bad. If you watch films on your monitor, you can't help but notice it.  PS. Amazon was great about refunding shipping. Amazon is the best online store there is 
 I love Jim Lehrer's news program, and I had heard that he was a prolific writer, and I am a passionate student of Civil War history, so you can imagine my delight when I saw this book for sale at the giftshop at the Antietam National Battlefield, having just visited Burnside's Bridge. The cover blurb was fascinating, the story looked fun -- and the book is 10% off at the park!  Alas, I must add my voice to the chorus here. Mr. Lehrer ain't no Hemingway. The story begins well, then rapidly begins introducing one-dimensional characters and implausible plot twists. I finished the book wishing that the story had ended a chapter or two earlier.  A final comment: if Mr. Lehrer wanted to deeply address the subject of futile infantry charges, ordered by incompetent commanders and made inevitable by gaps between technology and tactics, there are far better historical places where he could have done so -- all within easy reach of Mr. Lehrer's home in Washington. Frederickburg and Cold Harbor come to mind, but I'm sure there are many others 
 This is  the wrong message based on theory and speculations. Facts are confusing and not backed up by good controlled data.    Ther are numerous less well publicized but more scientific books available on this subject    see hypertensionfoundation.org for simple accurate informatio 
 I've been a Merle Haggard fan all my life and this CD is about as great as he gets. But, if you want the original recordings of these hits, look elsewhere 
 This book is nice, sweet, and somewhat insightful. But I wanted a book that spoke more of the relationship between a father and a son. The vast majority of essays/chapters in this book could have been written by anyone for anyone. For example, Nerburn warns of the dangers of drugs and alcohol, and extols the virtues of giving. But those lessons could have been taught by a mother to her daughter, a priest to a parishioner, or an uncle to a nephew. Many other essays in the book are similar in that they contain no unique perspective on the father-son relationship. (What does the "Power of Art" have to do with fatherhood?)  This book reads like Chicken Soup for the Soul. In my opinion, the other reviews overrate this book 
 It boggles the mind that anyone after 40 plus years would try and defend the conclusions of the Warren Commission that had any basic understanding of the case. The Warren Commission relied totally on the FBI and CIA whose mid level and lower level personnel were relatively honest, but the top was rotten to the core at the time and either lied to the Commission, prevented certain people from appearing, or withheld key information. Oswald was 360 Degrees from being the lone nut communist as portrayed by the Warren Commission. He was in contact with some dozen or so Intell assets in New Orleans primarily, but also Dallas. This is from the new Documents( If he was a true commie, do you think these people would work with him or associate?) released in the last 10-11 years.THere's a list in the book Treachery In Dallas by Walt Brown of some 150 people not called by the Warren Commission from every aspect of the case that had important information at odds with the Commission's findings.. If 20 0r 30 were called and asked the pertinent questions,I'm confident no one would insult us with the Oswald did it alone nonsense anymore 
   I gave this movie 1 star because it is not a true documentary.  It falls more along the same fodder as "Spinal Tap".  It is missing a counter point from GM.  One could argue that Roger had chances to talk with Moore, but choose not to.  One the other hand, Rogers missing interview is what gave the movie such an emotional hold.  I believe that Moore counted on not being granted air time at GM for the production of this film.  An interview would have killed the tone.   Watch the nightly news NOW.  Last night, March 22nd 2006, GM offered a one time buy out to some of it's employees.  The news reported that GM cannot afford to maintain its relationship with the UAW (Just like what caused the Flint situation in the film).  This same thing happened in the late 1980's and brought forth this extremely biased movie.  This film is entertaining in a strange way, but should not be considered to be the absolute truth.  Watch it with a grain of salt. For what it's worth, Under close examination, Careful consideration and Keen intellect, you will see a undercover message You might need to examine closely the content. Outwardly, things are not what they seem Until you look more closely. Many times the basic concept is Misread in the dialog Once you see this, and Open your mind to it, Rational thought will Emerge 
    Poorly done character work provides no insight into this weakly timed and tasteless rendition of a low caliber shot in the dark at a horror "novel".  No scene work, outside of the "Beast house", implies that this author is grinding out a novel with the intent to write a second or third in a series of books about cheap sex, gore, beasitality and pediphilia intent on making the reader retch.  This book would banned from some web sites, and the nanny guards would block it from most computers.        Three hundred and nine pages could have been shrunk to about one hundred considering the large print, oversized margins and full blank pages between chapters.  Publishers at Leisure Fiction should have reconsidered printing this one.  Save your money and buy a book that is properly labeled as adult porn. At least you will know what you are getting 
 If all you want is the patient information often handed out by drug stores, this is the book for you -- it covers almost all the prescription drugs on the market.  If, however, you want the pharmacology, etc., or even the name and address of the drug maker, you need the full PDR 
 The book was thrown together. The author wanted to be a first mover in the marketplace that analyzed what went wrong at Enron. However, the author neglected to mention in detail and explain how off balance sheet special purpose entities were Enron's demise. This is a waste of time and money to read 
 I almost bought this album.. thank goodness for the song list that included such sad, sorry songs as "We Built This City", "Hold On Loosely", and "Heart of Rock & Roll". I saved a lot of dollars. The rest of it had some promise. I am a HUGE fan of '80s music, but these songs were so over-played, I'm still sick of them. What about "Play The Game Tonight" by Kansas or "Sunday Bloody Sunday" by U2 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  In each case, there is just enough information, some of which applies to a later version of Knoppix, to turn the package on and then there are references to internet sites which requires hours of searching to find the answers to questions.  The author would have done well to explain the function of the commands that he uses.  There is an attempt to cover much more material than is possible in a book of this length.  The writing style is geared towards an eight grade level with the use of slang and cryptic names.  I expect a book to educate the reader, not simply provide a semi-accurate road map to information 
      This looks like a good idea from Westinghouse, but if you read the warranty details, the krypton bulb is not covered under the 10-year warranty.  $10.00 for a bulb that is warranted for 10 years - but not really?  What is the point?  Extra tape isn't even included when the first strip fails.         I suggest you use a flashlight 
 Rainbow fish has colorful shiny scales.  He is shamed into giving them to everyone.  Sounds like a communist primer 
 "Mr. Mani" is the story of a Sephardic family over a couple centuries, told via one side of conversations, and going backwards in time.  Both devices are hoary. I didn't believe for a second that the characters were of their own time. They were not even three-dimensional moderns. The prose alternates between plodding and precious. It's beyond me why this novel is well-respected 
 When I heard that one of my favorite B movies from the 80's was coming out on DVD I was happy!! I ordered this DVD from MEDIA BLASTERS / GUILTY PLEASURES (known as RAREFLIX on EBAY) for a reasonable price. After quick delivery I anxiously put the disc in to watch!                    Well.... first the good news. The old saying "Better to have something than nothing" is true. The Bad News? To start the source print is less than spectacular. The film is dirty, grainy at times. Multiple splices throughout disc. Full Screen transfer, no widescreen. Extras include 4 trailers from other films. There is a 'promotional' trailer of "Texas Lightning" on disc which is nothing more than the montage of scenes from the film's end made up as a teaser trailer.  Also to squash any rumors that might be floating about regarding the 'MAUREEN MCCORMICK NUDE SCENES', Uh.. They don't exist. At least not in this DVD version. Yes she does have a fling in a motel with one of the central characters but nothing more. I do recommend the VHS tape from MEDIA HOME VIDEO if you can locate it. Their transfer was from a better quality 35mm print. However if you are dying to see this film and do order the DVD, don't say I didn't warn you. 
 Not all that useful, really.  Message is "buy mutual funds!".  In general, since the vast majority of mutual funds underperform the market, just buy index funds would be the best advice.  Most of the text is entirely useless to someone who might want to trade individual stocks.  Passages suggest that if a company seems undervalued you might want to have lunch with the CEO to go over the financials and confirm your valuation.  Oh, thanks Peter, what great advice... ("Mr. Gates, your 11 o'clock is here to discuss purchasing 15 shares") 
 This text is by far the worst college text I have encountered in my educational career.  Where most texts stick to relevant facts and figures relating to their area of study, this text delves into opinion coupled with unbridled conjecture.  The text is littered with political opinions and political assumptions made about its reader, while listing irrelevant facts and theories that support a socialist Democrat view of the society of the United States.  Karl Marx and Socialism are continually defended as just economic forms of society while Capitalism is openly bashed at every page turn.  Conspiracy theories thrive in this book as it even accuses the United States' representational democracy as being ineffective, and that the country is actually ran by a conspiratorial "power elite."  The author often inserts personal opinion and biased so-called "personal experiences" with social issues as facts, and assumes the reader is a freshmen student unable to discern his fact from his fiction.   Here is a short excerpt from page 189, contained within a chapter dealing with social class:  Like many people, you may have said to yourself, "Sure I can vote, but somehow the big decisions are always made despite what I may think.  Certainly, I don't make the decision to send soldiers to Afghanistan or Iraq.  I don't launch missiles against Kosovo, or Baghdad.  I don't decide to raise taxes or interest rates.  It isn't I who decides to change welfare benefits."  I think it is clear here and in other excerpts from the text that the author should be writing editorials for his local newspaper instead of college texts.  It seems to me that the author intends to mold the minds of the college youth in his political image under the guise of giving a factual accounting of the field of Sociology.  I absolutely do not recommend this book to anyone, and think it is time to inform my university of the contents of this text before more students are forced to purchase it in its next incarnation.  Thanks for taking the time to read my review.  If you feel the same as I do about this text, then please speak up at your local university and here.  
 Hey here's an idea. What if Hitler was right all along, only it is men, not jews, who are to blame for all the woes of the world. We should build a new Auschwitz and exterminate them all. Right Andrea? In my opinion, this is just as bad as any misogynist. It's ridiculous garbage like this that has set the women's liberation movement back for so long 
 Total garbage for anyone interested in learning how to draw. I think another reviewer said you'd be better off getting pictures off the Internet and copying those. That's correct. This book is of no value whatsoever. A coloring book teaches you more 
 First I quit buying books with Ludlum's name on them, then I quite reading them . . . that was years ago and this mess brings it all back.  I received the Bancroft Strategy as a birthday present from my daughter who takes gift-giving very personally, so I had to keep it.  The only reason I give it 2 Stars is because I'm still reading it, waiting for two DeMille books I ordered to arrive.  The stuff in this book is just plain D U M B.  Definitely don't waste your money, and don't waste your time, unless you have a good reason to do so, like someone else's feelings 
 I bought this book excited by the premise and found it to be a sad disappointment. Populated with gross stereotypes, misrepresentative of the Faith, and full of poorly-constructed two-dimensional characters made colorful by circumstance rather than spirit, Rinaldi takes a beautiful piece of Church Lore and turns it into a relativistic anti-Catholic romp. Propaganda at its worst.  Irredeemably convoluted if not downright hateful 
 If you are a brand new CEO and need to know how to run your organization, buy this book.  If you are at any lower level, this book is not meant for you.    The authors state directly from the beginning that they focus more on CEOs than most other positions but the lessons learned are applicable to anyone.  This is not true.  The author focus too much on the role of a CEO.  The examples and suggestions are unique to that role.  In one section the book describes how to find your management blind spots such as research and development, marketing, etc.  If you are a software development manager in a large firm, your knowledge of marketing or R&D will most likely do little for your career.  Yet this book highlights that as areas you should improve.    Another example on how the book focuses too much on CEO is displayed in the how-to-work-with-your-boss chapter.  They entire chapter discusses how you should interact with the board of directors!  This is a complely different relationship than what 99.9% of workers engage in.  The relationship you have with your boss is possibly the most important relationship in your career.  To focus this chapter on working with the board makes it absolutely useless to anyone who is not an officer or anyone that does not work for a private firm 
 There are bad movies, and then there are BAD movies. "Universal Soldier: The Return" is a cosmically bad movie, a movie so poor in every aspect of its execution that one would have to look to "Manos: The Hands of Fate" for comparison. The first "Universal Soldier" film was a moderately entertaining shoot 'em up flick starring action stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and "Rocky" refugee Dolph Lundgren that essentially accomplished what it set out to do: people perished in violent ways, stuff exploded, and Van Damme and Lundgren beat each other into bloody pulps at the end of the film. Even the presence of the charming Ally Walker as Van Damme's female sidekick greatly helped the film. The movie garnered enough attention and fans to merit the release of a special edition DVD some time back. It unfortunately also garnered enough attention and fans to merit this unredeemable piece of trash sequel. The second, and one hopes final, installment in a franchise that should never have become a franchise achieves such heights of utter banality and stupidity that I sat in open-mouthed awe watching it. I think I can safely say I am less of a person for having sat through this atrocity. Expect to spend a few days in a coma after the credits roll.  Van Damme returns as Luc, the reanimated soldier who triumphed over the forces of government sponsored evil in the first film. On this outing he now works for Dr. Dylan Cotner (Xander Berkeley), a scientist who reconstituted the universal soldier program with the help of his supercomputer S.E.T.H. Luc, with his female sidekick Maggie (Kiana Tom), helps design and run training missions for a new batch of super soldiers. The film opens with what the filmmakers hope is a pulse-pounding jaunt up a river, a jaunt filled with explosions, stunts, gunfire, and the briefest glimpse of Tom's incredibly fit form. As the mission grinds to a halt we learn several important things: Kiana Tom is incredibly hot but can't act her way out of a paper bag, Luc has a daughter named Hillary (Karis Paige Bryant) who you just know will get into trouble at some point, and the only soldiers we must pay attention to are Romeo (Bill Goldberg) and the one played by Michael Jai White. Frankly, turning off the film immediately after glimpsing Tom's amazing physique is probably a good thing. Everything that follows is dull, predictable, and so full of plot holes as to defy description. "Universal Soldier: The Return" feels like eighty minutes of dental surgery rather than an action film.   Sure enough, Cotner's computer goes on the fritz and unleashes the killing power of the universal soldiers. In the resulting conflagration S.E.T.H. implants its consciousness in Michael Jai White, Luc and his loved ones flee from the compound, and the military swoops in to contain the problem. An extraordinarily untalented actress named Heidi Schanz also pops in as nosy reporter called Erin who is interested in exposing the government's latest shenanigans. Predictably, Van Damme and Schanz team up to track down...er...well, track down something to defeat the supercomputer. I think they need some code to shut the system down, but in the meantime the film takes them all over the place so that a wisecracking Romeo can follow them around while absorbing all the abuse Luc can hand out. Even throwing in a few scenes set in an adult's only club can't make this turkey fly. It's dull, folks, and painfully so. By the time the film grinds to its inevitable showdown between Luc and S.E.T.H. back at the shattered compound--with an injured Hillary's life balancing precariously in the background to serve as motivation for an overwhelmed Luc (Geez, what a surprise there!)--I knew I just wasted far too much of my life with this car wreck. How bad can it be, you ask? Read on...  Plot holes in this film are innumerable, as uncountable as grains of sand on the beach or acne on a teenager's face. For example, Luc explains to Erin that he was once a universal soldier just like Romeo but Cotner "cured" him by restoring him to life; he no longer needs injections or ice or any of the other devices used by the soldiers. What the heck are we doing marveling at this amazing supercomputer when Cotner just performed a miracle of biblical implications? He brought someone back from the dead! How exactly did he accomplish this feat? We don't find out from Van Damme, who simply smirks his way through a few lines of dialogue that simply boggle the mind with their monumentally idiotic implications. I could go on, but let's discuss the performances instead--or the lack thereof. I should say I adore Kiana Tom; she's a drop dead gorgeous babe with a body that could stop the earth's rotation, but watching her stumble through dialogue is like having your appendix taken out through your mouth. Another problem is the lumbering Bill Goldberg, whose "funny" lines are anything but. And the more I think about Heidi Schanz, the less I think of her. You have to wonder about a film where Jean-Claude Van Damme is the best thespian in the cast.  You might think a movie this foolhardy shouldn't contain any bonus features on DVD. You would be wrong. Trailers for this film, "The Return," "Double Team," "Desert Heat," "Knock Off," "Maximum Risk," and "Nowhere to Run" showcase the dubious career of Jean-Claude Van Damme. A making of feature, a Van Damme career retrospective (Ha!), a Michael Jai White feature, and talent bios round out the disc. My advice to those viewers thinking of renting "Universal Soldier: The Return"? Run, my friends, run far, far away and don't look back.     
 These goggles suck.  I swim an hour a day every day and not only do they scratch if a fingernail touches them, but they fog up in 5 minutes, fit terribly, are hard to adjust, and cause irritation around my eyes.  They leak water  and the different nose pieces are just a joke.  They go from tiny, a little bigger than tiny, huge, and then extra huge.  They don't fit!  What a waste of $15.  I've had similar success from goggles one can find at the grocery store.  They are only  $5, and they fog up and leak the same as these. 
 In "Rebel-in-Chief", author Fred Barnes does his best to prop up a failed administration.  Barnes is an inside-the-beltway Conservative commentator for -who else? "Fair and Balanced" Fox News, so it seems legitimate to question his impartiality.  Barnes praises Bush for taking bold action against terrorism, and providing unwavering leadership, even in times of decreasing public popularity.   But 2/3 of Americans know that the interests that Bush is protecting so fiercely are the interests of his base: "the haves and the have mores".  His energy policy was written with no input from environmentalists, while the CEO's of the nations major oil companies were invited to secret meetings at the White House with Dick Cheney, an unprecedented access to power.  Was anyone surprised when those companies who are enjoying record profits were the beneficiaries of munificent tax cuts at the tax-payers expense? Very little progress has been made in the last six years towards developing alternative sources of energy or increasing CAFE standards. I guess we will be drilling ourselves into oblivion. Bush and Cheney are consistent in one important way; they never forget who put them into office.      Bush is never held accountable in Barnes' mind for the debacle of Katrina. FEMA, which functioned efficiently during the Clinton years under James Lee Witt, was fused into the mammoth Dept.of Homeland Security.  Led by Michael Brown, a political hack who lacked the qualifications to run this key agency, FEMA became incapacitated by budget cuts and interagency in-fighting. No one holds Bush accountable for acts of nature, but a key function of government is to protect and defend its people. This was by all accounts, a failure of government at all levels.     Bush is also given a pass on his poorly-planned invasion of Iraq, and his failure to make the necessary personnel changes due to personal loyalty. Many have confused stubborness with steadfastness.  The most successful of our war time presidents -FDR, Lincoln, Wilson, Truman, have understood the need for a change of leadership at the top when the policy was failing. Instead, the public has been subjected to a pro-Iraq PR campaign that has never acknowledged the reality of the situation. Any nay-sayers were immediately attacked as traitors, discredited, or marginalized.  So this administration has put America in a situation with few options-if we stay the country will dissolve into warring factions, if we leave the country will dissolve into warring factions. Meanwhile the spectres of Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and Haditha will leave permanent scars upon the nation's psyche, cause incalculable harm to our image world-wide, and poison the very hearts and minds we seek to win. Conservatives, Barnes included, cannot admit this has been a catastrophic failure.     Finally, Barnes' premise that Bush is a rugged outsider in the vein of Ronald Reagan strikes me as ludicrous.  Bush, the son of a former president, who has led one of the most priviledged lives imaginable is as well-connected as one can imagine. He's never had to work, and didn't for many years, while struggling with multiple addictions. After having bottomed-out, he became a born-again evangelical. This accounts for his belief that he was appointed by G-d.  And who can question the policy of someone with such divine connections? Does this divinity also account for his arrogant refusal to entertain opposing points of view?  History will decide 
  The book is manipulative and unrealistic. I felt the author was blatantly trying to persuade the reader to believe that infieldey, betrayal and lack of morals is acceptable if you have a self absorbed best friend.  Definitely one of the shallowest books I have ever read.  I bought the book as it was rated as a "best seller" , and I was stuck in an airport for hours on end. The entire plot is hideous as the "burned best friend" makes up reasons why it's accept able to betray her best friend. If I was not completely bored, I would have given up on the book after the first 20 pages. 
 I was not very pleased with this art kit.  The caps to the markers do not stay on at all.  The markers seemed dry almost from the beginning.  The crayons and oil crayons are ok. And the wood case is very nice, but half the set is the markers and they look like they will dry out shortly.  I was disappointed 
 Maybe it was just me, but this concert DVD is a MAJOR disappointment!  It's quite surprising to see how little (if any) connection Madonna makes with the audience.  Shorn of her locks, her aerobically toned and fit body is the hard shell of an automaton here. Perhaps it's a result of her having become larger than life (ala Striesand, Whitney Houston,etc.).  Despite all the razzle-dazzle here, examples of an almost icy distance from her audience abound.  Songs like "Vogue" and "Express Yourself" should have been rousing stompers.  Instead, they are overstylized, choreographed to the max and perfunctory (the effect is like watching a canned TV award show performance).  Worst of ALL is her ill-conceived "Like A Virgin."  I can understand the need to refashion the same songs to forestall boredom, but "Virgin" recast as 1940's Marlene Dietrich nightclub lounge kitsch(complete with unisex tuxedo, top hat and faux-German accent)???? This is a shocking lapse in judgment--and boring to boot!!!    The only sign of life comes near the end, with the lock-step performance of "Holiday," which is seductively refashioned as a funky marching-band romp.  Here, she and her dancers perform in what must have been stifling maxi-length military-style coats!  One look at this performance and you can't help but wish for the juice of her earlier stuff. No one begrudges the right of an artist to change and grow, but there is something to be said for giving the audience what it came for.  I'm willing to give Madonna one more shot and pick up the Blond Ambition DVD when or if it becomes available.  Until then, my best advice is to check out DVDS featuring the likes of Tina Turner, Donna Summer or even Sade--they all prove that you can make the old new again, share and reveal something that a studio production can't, and thus never need to worry about going stale. Real concert greatness is not overstylized pomp--it's audience connection!   
 I had heard alot about this movie when I was a kid. So when I saw it on DVD I though it would be a good time to see it. I was wrong this movie is Bad and Boring. My advice, don't boy this DVD! 
 This is the fourth Friday 13:th movie. The first was rather lame, borrowing the style of music and some of the story from Psycho. The last 5 minutes were cool. The second was better, with more distance and awereness of not being unike, while not falling into the irony trap that later would poison movies in the 90ies. The third more or less cuts to the chase, with a mindless killer killing not so mindful teenagers.  I don't know what they tried to do in this one. Skinny dipping. Making out. Jason appears, kills, and disappears. Shower scenes. Watching old black and white nude movies. Maybe the ending is good, but the rest?! Dignity, can we have some dignity?  The one cool thing about this movie is that Halloween 4 might have borrowed from both it's beginning and it's end. But now you know, so you can still skip this one. (And now you know that I'm a nerd. 
 I received this book as a gift, which is the only reason it's not in a trash can right now. People are paying $17 for a bunch of recycled photos, only 40 or so of which portray Jesse James, along with a few hundred words of unreadable text? This is the "authorized" biography? Is the man's life so horrible that no one could write about it? Frankly, this book is an insult to Jesse's fans. If you want to read about Jesse, buy "Jesse James: The Man and His Machines," by Mike Seate 
 I bought this book because it was required (a textbook for a class I was taking).  Because it was a college-level class, I was expecting a college-level textbook.  That's not what it is at all.  The book is filled with color illustrations that aren't even very helpful.  I was hoping for more reading and explanation of terms.  Illustrations are great if they are used right -- to compliment the text instead of replace it.  I wouldn't recommend this book for someone who is serious about learning the ins and outs of networking 
 Definately only a book to use to look up names.  not to actually help you find one. You can find this type of alphabetical dictionary set up of names many places online for free 
 I work in a school library and as a cat lover am always seeking out the cat books.  This one caught my eye and I was expecting something wonderful.  I found the story to be hopeless and defeating.  How sad the only comfort the father has to offer is composting tips and the last memory the child has to hold is that of a decomposing cat.  I'm no censor, but two thumbs way down.  Also, if you are looking for something wonderful for pet loss, try Cynthia Rylant's, Cat Heaven 
 Having been a fan of Antonia Fraser for many years, I highly anticipated her biography of Queen Marie-Antoinette, but have been very disappointed in that she often chooses the sensational over the factual. She depicts Marie-Antoinette's mother Empress Maria Theresa as heartless and calculating for sending her daughter to France at age 14 to get married, but arranged marriages were the norm; the empress was not doing anything out of the ordinary. What startled me most is that Fraser not only insists on Antoinette having an affair with Count Axel von Fersen, of which there is little concrete evidence, but goes onto maintain that Axel used condoms to keep the queen from getting pregnant. It seems to me that Marie-Antoinette loved children so much; she came from a family of sixteen where children were valued and her more liberal sister Caroline went on to have eleven children or more. She was also a devout Catholic and using such devices were unthinkable, unless one was a prostitute or dealing with prostitutes. In this case Fraser is applying the morals of some British aristocratic ladies to a queen of France. If Marie-Antoinette had been caught in adultery, it would have been considered treason; she would have been sent to a convent and had her children taken away from her. With all of her enemies at Court, that was not a risk she would have taken, if she had been so inclined. On a smaller scale, Fraser makes ridiculous assertions about Marie-Antoinette dyeing her hair - in all the pictures that I have seen of her, her hair looks grey from either powder or premature age; I have never read any first hand accounts of her dyeing it. Not that that is a big deal; but it makes me wonder where Lady Fraser's life ends and where Marie-Antoinette's life begins. I found it offensive that at the end Fraser interprets Marie-Antoinette's death as some kind of sacrifice for the cause of democracy, when she believed in monarchy and wanted her little son to be king. Especially, since Marie-Antoinette's murder was followed not by democracy but by dictatorships and Napoleon crowning himslf emperor. Sadly, there is a lacuna of decent biographies of the queen in the English language. One can only hope that the works of Bertieres, Chalon, and Delorme will soon be translated and published in English. Fraser's book does have some interesting details (aside from those which flow from her imagination) and it is much more sympathetic to the queen than Lever's travesty 
 ...I'm so dissappointed in CaseLogic for discontinuing the hard cases. They were great, a HARD cover with rubberized coating and actual cd case style holders inside (that you pop out with your finger by pressing the center). Somebody could have sat on it and it would've been fine.. 
 I don't think I would consider these the best loved poems. Yes, they are by classic authors. but in all honesty I found this to be just an average read of poems I could of found off the net.  My suggestion is, if your looking for brilliant poetry to check out Theological Immortal Romance by author Kevin Brian Wright here on amazon. 
 Arthur Rimbaud, the nineteenth-century poet, prodigy, and mystic who composed almost all his writings before the age of eighteen, and whose literary and aesthetic doctrine that a poet must degrade and sublimate his personality in order to become ''a visionary'', or one who can percieve the infinite and speak with the voice of a God, was crucial in shaping the development of literature in the twentieth century, was truly an ingenious writer, and person.    The same cannot, unfortunately, be said for the screenwriter and director of "Total Eclipse", who have taken the biography of this unique, fascinating individual and transformed it into a nineteenth century "Jerry Springer" of sorts. The movie is, admittedly, historically accurate, at least in most respects. That is not it's primary fault. But it suffers from a number of significant shortcomings in other areas which make it not simply a dissapointingly mediocre, annoying film, but an insult to admirers of Rimbaud as well.   One of the main problems of "Total Eclipse" is it's star. Not neccessarily his acting,in this case: but simply his presence. Leonardo DiCaprio is simply too familiar a face, and his portrayal of the young Rimbaud as nothing less than a hateful, boorish, monster is beyond offensive. Not to deny that Rimbaud was without shortcomings: indeed, he is known as much for his poetry as for his strange and explosive personality. Yet the movie's excessively negative portrayal of the poet would be more tolerable if it provided any insight into his poetry, which it unforgivably fails to do. Throughout the movie, Rimbaud's writing is reduced to a mere footnote: we are assured numerous times of his genius, yet are not even informed of the titles of his most significant works, namely, "Le Bateau Ivre (The Drunken Boat) ''Illuminations'', and "Un Saison En Enfer" (A Season in Hell)." No. What we get instead, as in most big-budget Hollywood productions, is a sensationalized biography in which the truly important aspects of Rimbaud's life are, as the film's title would suggest, totally eclipsed, by incidents (specifically, the alleged homosexual love affair between Rimbaud and the older poet Paul Verlaine, which, though not without importance, occupies the entire focus of the film) which would appear, today, in a supermarket tabloid.   ''Total Eclipse'' feels, throughout, like a lazy, slapdash effort, starting with a few half-hearted attempts to ennumerate Rimbaud's philosophy and culminating as a series of petty, melodramatic squabbles between the central characters. And yet, just like a middle-brow soap opera, or an episode of "Jerry Springer", the movie is sometimes guiltily compelling, such as when Rimbaud decries another poet's work and creates havoc by urinating on his writing (another example of an event shamelessly exaggerated in order to appeal to John Q. Public). Rimbaud may indeed have been an anti-social jerk at times, and the film-makers deserve a small amount of credit for tackling this important but cinematically neglected subject; but any reader of his poetry and letters will discover a far more rational and sympathetic Rimbaud than the one portrayed in this dismal, over-simplfied "biography". As Dicaprio's Rimbaud himself might say, "Pitiful."   
 I had all the same rebate issues with this item as others, so if you are buying this CD case just because of the rebate, please DON'T.  I did finally receive my rebate, 4 months later after a second mailing in and irate email.  I just cashed the check and I'm crossing my fingers that it actually goes through!  The product itself seems okay.  I can see if you use it a lot that the zipper might break, but I rarely get into my CDs so I haven't had that issue yet.  However, I do not plan to ever buy from this company again because of all the rebate run around.  A very dishonest company if you ask me.  Good luck to everyone else waiting for a rebate 
 I was very disappointed with the ending of this new Danielle Steel.  It seemed like a very long read, with a very quick ending.  I have read every one of her books, and have never been so disappointed with a story until now.  I would not recommend this to anyone 
 I was assigned this book for a class in East Asian-World Politics, so I read it thoroughly and was thoroughly disappointed.  The assumptions that this book is based on are fallacious and misguided, and the authors seem to  have no understanding of either Chinese political culture or the nature of  international relations. To begin with, the book spends most of its time  highlighting and exaggerating sources of tension between the two countries,  and seems to assume that every tension between two states will inevitably  lead to full-scale war.  This assumption is sadly mistaken.  In fact, the  United States and Canada have outstanding disagreements on a number of  issues, yet experience close relations and have the longest unguarded  border in the world. The book relies mostly on provacative statements made  by members of the Chinese Communist Party to support its thesis.  It  ignores the fact that it is common practice in Chinese politics to speak  loudly and negatively about whomever China currently disagrees with.  Just  because a member of the National People's Congress says war with the United  States is inevitable over human rights doesn't mean it will happen.  Have  the authors ever heard Jesse Helms (or many other senators, for that  matter) speak?  Note their reluctance to use force to settle the Taiwan  issue. The entire book comes off as a heavily-biased college paper on  US-Chinese relations.  The fact that they use virtually no primary-source  material or Chinese-language material not already translated adds to this  perception.  It appears that the authors decided the hypothesis of the book  beforehand, and simply searched for information to support their theory.   As flawed and biased a book as I have come across in a long time 
 This movie is so bad. It is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems. The only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character, a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities. The movie tries hard to invent new "teen speak" with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character, Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end, she's like Ella May Clampet going after Jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out. 
 I THINK IS VERY DIDACTIC FOR MI I DO NEED MORE PRACTICE ON  EVERY ITEM FOCUSIN IN EACH CHIL  PROBLEMS DIFFERENT KIND OF  EXERCISES WIL BE MORE INTERESTING FOR ME AND THE KID AND NOT TO BE MORE REPETING EVERY ITEM THANK 
 This book has 2 sides: the title, and the liberal rant. On the one hand, the case is clearly made that several sucessive congresses and presidents have engaged in short-sighted and fiscally destructive practices by borrowing from the SS Trust Fund to spend on current programs. For this, future America will have tough times. On the other hand, the author has engaged in typical liberal rant and subjective attacks on the current president that make up about 75% of this small book. This rant contains mis-representation of economic facts such as: total ommision of underlying factors for the 90's boom such as the spending wave of the baby-boom generation, understating the effect of oil prices on economic trends, and ommision of the impact of the business cycle when it suits the author's politics. The major failing however, is a complete absence of footnotes, and only a few select references of any kind. Still, despite the attack nature of this book, the truth of the soon-to-be insolvent SS Trust Fund is an extremely important subject, and should be of great concern for all Americans 
 I like Jimmy and have been impressed with his involvement in domestic and international events.  This is the first book of his I tried to read.  Endangered Values isn't much of a book, 202 pages in 17 chapters of double-spaced large font with plenty of white space interspersed throughout.  If you can get over the heavy dose of religion sprinkled throughout the book, and the shady partisan statistics and studies cited within, he addresses a wide variety of issues.  Sort of like trying to solve all the puzzles of the world in 60 or so regular pages.  The biggest turnoff for me was the religion.  Maybe my own fault considering the title and what I should've expected 
 Alright....sounds like every other emo-rock band that's out there today, EXCEPT they have a female vocalist that makes Karoke Night seem appealing.  She sings like a 4th grader in the school chorus....Sing louder than all your friends so your mom can hear you is MUCH cooler than actually singing well.  Buy this album if you need a good ear-bleeding.  It is a shame because the rest of the band has a decent sound, then they let her sing the courus and your brain melts out of your ears all over your new shirt.  So what it comes down to is that you just bought a CD that you are not physically capable of ever listening to again, and you gotta buy a new shirt.  Do the math 
 I was so pleased with the workmanship of this product when I opened it up.  It had everything I was looking for, and I was astonished it didn't sell for twice as much - definitely a professional quality build on the outside.  HOWEVER, Breville must have poor quality control.  After 20 minutes on the grill, chicken filets were still white, not a bit of browning anywhere.  I had it on sear (420 degrees).  So, I took my candy thermometer and placed it between the two grill plates, closed the lid, and let is sit for 20 minutes.  The temperature was 220 degrees rather than the 420 degrees it says it cooks at.  Needless to say, unless you want to grill or boil water, nothing is going to cook.  This was my first Breville product and will be my last.  Obviously quality control is not a concern otherwise they would have caught that this machine has thermostat problems.  It's a shame such a finely built, heavy machine (cosmetically) can't heat any hotter than an aquarium heater.  I was very disappointed.  I am returning it this weekend 
 This cd has some great movie themes but the performances are lousy. The  "Red Nash Orchestra" consists of one person playing all of the  parts on a synthesizer. The selections have no orchestral life and very  poor depth. Also, some of the arrangements are quite sloppy. Avoid this cd  and buy Erich Kunzel/Cincinnati Pops "Round Up". It has great  western themes and the lush sound of a great orchestra 
 Fugazi is so bad it hurts, I've never liked them because they can't sing and their music is just plain boring. These guys are so old its funny, whoever takes this band seriously is an idiot. 
 This is the most dumbest story I've ever seen.  It does not make sense and waste of my time to watch it. 
 Even a week ago I would have said this is book is probably the best popular introduction to the subject. Now that the New York Times has effectively called into question every word published on the subject by its reporter, Judith Miller, I feel I should warn folks to read the book with the NYT's admitted failures in mind. It's not clear how this scandal relates to the information in the book not associated with Iraq's bio-chem weapons programs, but those sections at least are thoroughly tainted by the evolving story of how Iran/Chalabi/White House/DoD collaborated to manipulate public/government opinion by feeding Miller disinformation 
 The first dishwasher that I received from Etronics was dented, dirty and looked as though it had been used.  I complained, they picked it up, and one month later I got the replacement.  It wasn't in much better shape, but I kept it anyway because I was tired of waiting. The dishwasher cycle takes about 90 minutes, and although it cleans well, the adapter to hook it up is cheaply made, and it leaks even with teflon tape.  I would not make this purchase again 
 Not worth the price at all... The bead work looks very cheap... The color does not look the way its shown in the picture. Decided to return it the moment I opened the box.. 
 Non linear, rambling, off the mark mish mosh. A total lack of writing discipline. I read it to the bitter end, hoping for some enlightenment which never came.  Unlike the other reviews I was unmoved and unimpressed 
 The title of this book states that the rules in it are for the year 2007. However, when looking into the contents it turns out that the rules are those for the year 2006. Disappointment 
 I am a big fan of the show, and was disappointed that for so long, only a few episodes were available to purchase, and those were only on VHS. I was really happy when I heard they're releasing the complete series on DVD... but if you ask me, these DVDs are worse than having nothing at all.  The box advertises "complete, uncut" episodes and yet many episodes are missing scenes for no apparent reason. I can't imagine the reason for this. The DVD picture and sound quality are far worse than the VHS releases. How does that even happen? The episodes are also missing the introductions (which are different for each episode, depending on guest stars, etc)... left out for no reason. The DVDs also have no chapter stops whatsoever.  How does this happen in the modern day entertainment industry? No one in charge of product quality, no one even attempting to release something up to DVD standards, yet they hired someone to delete scenes that aren't crucial to the plot? I just don't get it... did they think DVDs have very limited space, and they have to take any steps necessary to reduce the length of the show?  The Little House series still appears on cable TV. You can literally get a much better quality product simply by taping the shows off of TV... this DVD release is a joke.  It's a bit frustrating to see so many shows (including older shows and less popular ones) are having great DVD releases, with great quality video and sound, and actor commentary despite the show being made decades ago... and then to see that Little House is treated so poorly 
 But at least it's entertaining. This is the story of a typically dull V.C. Andrews-type heroine who lives with her gorgeous mother, handsome, overprotective father, bitter aunt and evil cousin in a victorian mansion somewhere in the south. The aunt and mother drink tea all day, the father spends most of his time at his job, and Audrina plays with paper dolls while cousin Vera torments her and masturbates while reading romance novels. A long time ago, Audrina's perfect, beautiful sister was raped and killed. Since then, her parents have devoted thier lives to protecting Audrina from the outside world. One day, Audrina wanders outside and meets a boy named Arden and his mother, Billie, who live in a cabin behind her. They become friends, and Audrina starts sneaking outside to see him. Daminan, the father, soon catches her, and is angry at first, but after meeting the boy, lets the friendship continue. Audrina's life changes from there. Tragedy and romance ensue. As the title suggests, this is one of the worst books I've ever read. The story does not contain one shred of plausibility. It also suffers from dull, unlikeable charectors, just like Flowers in The Attic did. You know things are bad when your rooting for the evil cousin. Audrina is so beautiful, perfect and inncocent and most off all flat that you can't stand her. Arden came off as being just as annoyingly perfect. Things start off very slowly, with mainly descriptions of the charectors, "creepy" mansion and the tragedy of the death of the "first" Audrina and Damians obsession over it biding our time before something finally happens. Things start rolling once the mother dies, and I admit that I couldn't put it down after this heartbreaking development, even though I was able to predict nearly every twist it had to offer. The book jacket plays up on the whole idea of Damian wanting to turn Audrina into her dead sister, and generally makes it seem likes its going to be alot more creepy than it really is. This wanting-to-turn-Audrina-into-her-dead-sister horror story-type thing only takes up a short amount of the book in the beginning. The rest of the story is a rather average, though addictive family & romance drama. I reccomend it if you want a entertaining, trashy drama/romance novel tinged with mystery and horror and charectors you love to hate. 
 This book is a feeble attempt to slam a politician. There's nothing constructive here, just liberal whinning. 
 Como aficionado acérrimo de MVLL desde la Ciudad y los Perros, encontré esta última novela bastante decepcionante.  El personaje central se tilda a sí mismo de cacaseno, precisamente el vocablo que utilizaba MVLL contra los apristas en las elecciones del 90.  Pero es más un aburrido total sin pizca de la picardía limeña.  Cuando el personaje estaba a punto de tirarse al río en París, daba ganas de darle un buen empujón para ahorrarnos por lo menos cien páginas más de tortura.  Y su contacto con las eventos sociales de las últimas décadas se asemeja a la de un Forrest Gump quien todo lo ve y nada lo capta.  Pero quien diga que la vena de MVLL ya se acabó se equivoca: la reciente Fiesta del Chivo es fenomenal.  Los hinchas del fútbol tenemos que clarificar una error en el libro: el compadre de Valeriano López en el Boys (y luego en el Alianza) en los años cincuenta fue don Willy Barbadillo, no Jerónimo Barbadillo quien militó en la selección del 82 
 Book is really a disapointment. It seems to suffer from being a companion book to a TV program and so does not stand up as a cookbook on it's own right. I buy cookbooks for inspiration and ongoing learning  but don't care for watching TV Chefs. Chef Yamaguchi it seems is a very creative cook ,but if you are going to try to sell books for $32.50 it needs more stuffing. I want to know more about how he thinks and were his insparation comes from. I feel that bought Sam Choy and Alan Wong offer more of this to my understanding. I would have also liked to have the English names listed in the recipes. I spent a lot of time looking in the Pantry section to find out what the differant ingredants were 
 It is difficult to believe that such a slow and dull book could be written about such a compelling subject.  The reviewers who have lamented the short, choppy paragraphs that irritatingly jump from one scene to another, without benefit of full explanation or connection, are correct to scorn the overall poor writing that makes up this book.  I had to read some paragraphs several times and even then didn't understand what I was reading.  It was nearly impossible to picture most of the action in my mind, as it was mostly just a jumbled collection of facts and anecdotes that rambled on and on and on.  The description of the fire itself drags on chaotically for fifty tedious pages, which incited one yawn after another.  The book lacks any sense of focus and the author uses a very poor choice of words in many instances.  For example, the narrative is littered with sentences like: "She made for the east exit..."  Okay, fine, but did she run, walk, crawl, hop, skip, jump, or fly to the east exit?  I just don't know what to picture there.  The word "made" says nothing descriptive and is therefor about the worst word that could have been chosen.  This type of problem occurs on every page of the book.  I haven't read anything else the author has written, so I hate to be so critical.  I wonder, however, why his editor didn't send his manuscript back to him with thousands of suggestions.  I felt as if I was reading a very hastily-prepared early draft.  I have read many gripping books about disasters and survival situations.  This just isn't one of them.  Compare "The Circus Fire" to "Into Thin Air," "Heart of the Sea," "Batavia's Graveyard," or "Ordeal by Hunger" and you'll understand what I mean 
 Book offers meaningless tasks to deliver. Too much time reading, and too much time wasted if applied. 
 I was thoroughly disappointed while reading Lord of Silent, as the overall action and suspense was kept almost at a minimum.   It seems almost as if Peters went on a long tangent about the Emerson's family life, writing a lot of filler to go along with the main plot. Until the last forty pages or so, I struggled to get through the book because there was no suspense at all. No cliff-hangers or anything of the sort.  Ramses and Nefret, though darling, only thickened the struggle. I don't think that all the interaction between them was really necessary; perhaps Peters wanted to throw in some romance, but is wasn't working.  Lord of the Silent is a sheer failure of Peters's story-telling skills, as in many of her other books her talent proves to be quite brilliant. Save your money and buy a different Peters's book 
 This book offered very little new information other than the basics that any of us who have ever done process improvement already know. Although the authors mention how Lean works in non-manufacturing environments, their examples are almost purely manufacturing.  Not a bad read for a college student, but a waste of time for practitioners. Totally an introduction 
 Absent of any quality.  Throughly disappointing.  All the Naxos Sherlock series is without ANY redeeming valu 
 As a Construction Superintendent I previously used the sixth edition and was looking forward to the new 10th Edition. What a disapointment. Much of the useful text has been replaced with useless dimensions for every type of furniture imaginable. Many chapters have been stripped down to brief over views, and turned into "that's what this is called" details.   If that's the type of book your looking for there are many other less expensive options out there.   If you need serious details, try some of the previous editions since the means and methods of construction don't change significantly. You may find some of the newer materials aren't included in previous editions, however, what good is it to you if the 10th Edition only shows you a cross section of the material 
 This is what happens when great authors go to seed. It seems like a cruel mockery of a Greene novel, parading the same old themes around, corrupted more than ever by an unjustified excess liberalism. There isn't a single living character here, and even though the prose is generally competent, I think it has to be buried in consideration of the man's memory 
 2 1/2 stars   Attempting another soundscape masterpiece, Stratosphere has not aged so well. The music - simple, the production- dated, the performances- uninspired. There are attempts at greatness, hints of interesting fusions try to breathe a different life into the hollow art of looping. Mostly though this is more akin to like acts such as Jarre or Kraftwerk then their more inspired material. Whereas on an album like Phaedra, the mechanics of their repetition somehow liberated, on Stratosphere the mechanics enslave entire compositions into tight neat little boxes to look at, rather then truly feel. The self conscious songwriting further keeps the experience at bay, but if you concentrate more on the spaces in between the generically frustrating  fast synth-bass-cheese, you might feel a few conceptual ideas worth the investment. 
 I bought this because i really enjoyed Shine. Unfortunately, Save Me has an entirely different sound which is much more "popular rock" oriented with the typical quieter intros then blast 'em with the chorus. Save Me has none of the great guitar work in Shine and is lyrically very weak. I will usually keep a cd if it has even one song i like but this one is being donated to the library so i can at least take a tax write-off 
 Walter Mosley is normally a detective writer, known for his Easy Rawlins stories. Blue Light is a diversion into a genre that would fall somewhere between science fiction and new age. Various people in northern California are zapped with a blue light that makes them weird. According to the book's cover flap, the light brings out the potential of any person it strikes. However in the book it simply magnifies their existing personality. A smart girl becomes really smart, a young girl with quick reflexes becomes something of a ninja, and a promiscuous wife becomes a sex goddess. Mr Mosley is a talented writer. His prose and some of his action sequences makes this book readable. Unfortunately there's little balance between good and evil, which is problematic since the whole second half of the book is one long buildup of suspense towards a final apocalyptic encounter. Even more unfortunate is the fact the long awaited encounter is tedious and uninteresting. There's a few great and captivating scenes in this book, but otherwise extremely little to recommend itself 
 Pages 1003 thru 1050 were missing in my copy. Pages 1051 thru 1098 were repeted.  Check your copy carefully. The book would have been more helpful if all the pages indicated in the index existed.  
 Reminds me of one of those baseball books with statistics but not much else.  The stories are short and typically discuss one or two hands at most.  If you want history it may have value but it will not improve your play 
 This series may be good for a laugh. Some of the writing is engaging.   But the premise is absurd.   WHY, in this day and age, should anyone accept the world-view of the Bible? A book that tells us to buy and sell slaves, stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe's beliefs, and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of Mt. Sinai?   In a sense, Bible believers have been "left behind" since the 1700s Enlightenment. Tom Paine's "The Age of Reason" showed the God of the Bible to be a cruel, vindictive monster. And what did Thomas Jefferson call the book of Revelations? "The ravings of a madman."   Read this series, if you like. Enjoy parts of it. But make no mistake: to take any of this seriously, you have to regress to a prehistoric world-view, before men learned to think, to ask questions; before logic or science -- a time when dazed, superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth, if they didn't grovel humbly enough to their supposed god.   Do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one? When the "sheep" are raptured up to heaven, their clothes are left behind. So heaven is a nudist colony?   The basic contradiction, of course, lies in using worldly action (some of it exciting) to proselytize for the unworldly, the supernatural.   But why should we care whether any of the "good" guys gets killed? And why should THEY mind -- won't they go straight up to heaven? That's what they WANT, isn't it? Why even lift a finger against the "bad" guys -- didn't Christ say, "Resist not evil"?   Worried about who will win? "God" is infinitely powerful. So Jesus (who is 1/3 of God -- or something like that) is sure to win when Armageddon rolls around, in book 12 of the series. And the "sheep" -- the believers -- will happily worship him, looking just like the pictures of dim-witted, bovine people you see in the tracts Jehovah's Witnesses leave at your door.   The going price for a used copy of "Tribulation Force" is one cent. Does that tell you something?   Actually, the story-telling is worth more. The basic premise is worth less. Perhaps it averages out 
 Yup, definately the worst Halloween movie. Come on, Michael on a reality show? Ha! What the f**k does that have to do with the series? Not only that, but the plot is completely pointless, the acting sucks, and Dr. Loomis and Jamie are nowhere to be found in the movie! Not only that, but the movie relies way too much on gore to be scary, and therefore comes off as pretentious. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE gore in movies, horror or not, but any knowledgable Halloween fan knows that the Halloween movies were always scary without the gore. Along with Halloween 3 (which actually had nothing to do with Michael), Halloween: Resurrection reigns as the worst movie of the series. There are a many more problems with the movie than the ones I listed, but I'm tired of typing, so I'll let other reviewers explain why it's so bad. Bottom line, watch ANY Halloween movie other than this or Halloween 3 
 I don't even understand why Peter Heller wrote this book. First of all, his descriptive skills are awful. How he could fail to give the reader a sense of what the Gorge is really like is beyond me. Ian Baker's book does a much better job. Secondly, he was a hack commercial journalist scabbing along on a legendary expedition. I give him credit for pulling no punches regarding the kayakers' feelings about him. After slogging through this underwhelming book, I bought the DVD that the kayakers shot. Much more bang for the buck. Peter Heller needs to learn a lesson that my 7th grade English teacher taught me: Show me, don't tell me 
 It seems like this book just copied information from earlier books on the subject and rushed to capitalize on the increase of AS diagnoses. Atwood's book is far more interesting, informative and original. I've seen this woman speak as well, and she seems a bit unclear 
 I have never received this product.  It has been sent to me in 4 separate shipments over the past 3 months and has never arrived.  Tracking the items indicates that the USPS receives it damaged and returns it to Amazon.  It's been very disappointing, inasmuch as I asked my friends to give me Amazon gift certificates for my birthday, so that I could buy it from Amazon.  It's now carried by Target, and I could buy it there, but Amazon won't turn my gift certificates into cash, so that I could use the cash to buy the items instead of waiting for it to arrive at my local post office damaged again.  I have re-ordered using my gift using my certificates again.  Let's keep our fingers crossed 
 This book appears to be a compilation of pamphlets from 1919 to 1949 by "The Tibetan" communicating clairaudiently with Ms Bailey. Opinion seems to be divided as to whether books such as this are works of great spiritual value or are Satanic works connected with the "New World Order".  The world according to "The Tibetan" appears to be governed by someone called Sanat Kumara (obviously, a slight shuffle of the letters changes Sanat to Satan), who is also known as "Ancient of Days", "the true Light of the World" and "the Eternal Youth". Supposedly leading to him are "the One Universal Church", "the sacred inner lodge of all true Masons" and the "inner-most circles of the esoteric societies". The masonic movement is described as "a far more occult organisation than can be realised".  There are some controversial statements to be found within these pages: fascism and communism are described as "great world ideologies" (p126); "reincarnation is a basic law of nature" (p232); "the Axis nations need to grasp the teaching of the Buddha, Lord of Light" (p359); Gandhi is described as someone who "brings into clear perspective the uncompromising fanatical attitude" and who "would precipitate civil war in India" (p368); "the Jews should recognise the Christ as the messiah" (p545). Possibly worst of all are the statements that "the Japanese nation must go back to the nursery state" (p428) followed by a comment on page 491 that "the release of atomic energy in connection with the bombing of Japan" was "the greatest spiritual event which has taken place since the the human kingdom appeared".   What else? "Schools of thought and world religions are to be blended into one" (p30), "Jews are to be integrated into society" (p77). The finale can be found on page 566: apparently "seeds have been planted for a 'final act of destruction' when humanity and Heirarchy are 'completely fused and blended'".  I found most of the book to be repetitive waffle about world peace, Masters, ashrams, service, etc. The "Heirarchy" is supposedly based at the "Great White Lodge on Sirius" and it would appear that the one world religion is to be a mix of Christianity and Buddhism.    Atheism never appeared so attractive 
 I'm completely baffled by the five-star reviews for this book. The main characters are likable enough, certainly, but nothing. ever. happens. There is no narrative tension and no real plot, no conflict, no obstacles for the characters to overcome, nothing of substance--just a vaguely pleasant meandering toward an indefinite conclusion. Even the much-anticipated baby seems to disappear into the background once she arrives, like a sitcom baby whose birth is a great episode for sweeps week but who is conveniently asleep off-camera  for every episode thereafter.   Perhaps my opinion was tainted by reading this book too soon after Alison McGhee's "Shadow Baby" -- a book with both style AND substance. Colwin suffered in the comparison. However lovely her sentences and paragraphs may be, in this case they don't add up to anything greater than the sum of their parts 
 One reviewer has said that listening to this recording is like watching the movie Titanic with the characters dressed in T-shirts and cut-offs. Apt, but not extreme enough. How about watching Rocky with the characters dressed in periwigs and knee-britches! Anachronism fails in either direction. Schiff imposes his late Romantic sensibility on Bach with the foolish determination of a father who wants his musical son to be a football star or a dentist.  The best recording of the Goldberg Variations currently available is by Trevor Pinnock. An even better version is that of Bob van Asperen, but it's out of print 
 I agree with several of the previous reviewers. I believe that some of the writing on skin tones offers great insight. I also believe that most of the portraits in the book are garish at best. If there were Sears Portrait Studios around before the invention of photography there is no doubt that their portraits would look like these paintings. I would even be okay with that if it weren't for the fact that the book does not even begin to discuss skin tone until halfway through the book. I would say that 1/5 of the book is actually about skin tone. The rest of the book is just like any other beginners How-To. The basics of painting. Unfortunately there is little about skin tone. 
 There is only one word to describe this flick - SILLY.  Good for 10 year olds and younger.  Story weak.  Acting mediocre.  The action sequences look very "staged" and unnatural and are unbelievable.  One glaring error.  This movie is set in early California, before it becomes a state.  Near the end of the film they show an American flag - and it has 50 STARS on it!!!  Mama Mia!!  Couldn't even get that right.  The title should have been "The Legend of Zero" 
 I bought this book to learn about switching power supplies. The types are not dicussed. The formulas given to calculate inductor values generate results that contradict each other and don't make sense. Reads like a poorly written application note 
 We were very disappointed with the musical quality of the CD.  The artist's command of pitch was lacking 
 A very sad and depressing book about an unhappy teenager.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you like feeling worse than before you started reading 
 I used an earlier edition of this book for symmetry/group theory and couldn't figure out what the heck was going on! Fortunately, there are lots of good alternatives:  1. "Molecular Symmetry and Group Theory: A Programmed Introduction to Chemical Applications" by Alan Vincent. This one is Excellent. It takes you by the hand and gives you a tutorial!    2. "Group Theory for Chemists" by George Davidson. Out-of-print now but look for it used.  3. "Molecular Symmetry and Group Theory" by Robert L. Carter, ISBN 0471149551  4. "Group Theory and Chemistry" by David M. Bishop. inexpensive.   5. "Introduction to Molecular Symmetry" (Oxford Chemistry Primers) by J. S. Ogden. inexpensive  Also look at chapter 1 of "Symmetry and Spectroscopy: An Introduction to Vibrational and Electronic Spectroscopy" by Daniel C. Harris & Michael D. Bertolucci   For a very nice overview try "Symmetry through the Eyes of a Chemist" by István Hargittai & Magdolna Hargittai   P.S. For a similar book to Vincent's try "Beginning Group Theory for Chemistry" by Paul H. Walton. It's meant to be written in (pencil!).  Look at my other reviews for other chemistry books 
 I will not buy this, or any other CD, that contains predatory software that makes the buyer vulnerable to spyware, viruses, and other PC problems.  Talk about lousy customer service!  What is Sony trying to protect?  It was proven during the days of cassettes that convenience copying does not hurt the music industry.  Those who would pirate the music, large scale, will find a way around the copy protection anyway.  We consumers are the only losers 
 DO NOT order.  They only placed an order for 7 months but I got billed for 12.  After 3 hours on the phone they said that 7 months was all the publisher had available and they cannnot extend it.  After pitching a fit they offerred to give me a partial refund but cannot extend the subscription.  Only order from the magazine itself 
 I'm taking a college course and this book really bites. Reading it just leaves me in a daze. He goes on and on about how this method won't work and that method won't work which completely covers up what we need to learn. I'm getting 98.18% in the class on term 8 of 10, but it's not due to this book. Unfortuneatley I'm stuck with the book because it's what the school uses. Find another one 
 This is without a doubt the worst reference on typography that I have ever read. It is filled with useless metaphors and examples. I really expected more from the Adobe Press 
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 I am a fan of comedy movies, but I have never understood why films like "Overboard" are filed in that genre.  This film is SICK.  A man takes advantage of a woman suffering memory loss and makes her into his personal slave?  Add to that he forces his children to go along with him and the brats treat her horribly.  It doesn't say much that his wife has passed away, because he's NOT looking in for a wife or mother (as SICK as that would be to FIND a wife/mother that way), but he is taking HORRIBLE advantage over.    This is NOT a family comedy.  I cannot believe so many reviewers here are raving about it because if you heard of someone doing this on the news you would want the sucker put to death.  I cannot find laughter someone's suffering being put on display 
 Too bad that the last of the Ripley books was a bit of a let-down.  A great set up and interesting premise, the book is marred by its poor resolution.  What potential - two vulgar Americans who become Ripley's neighbors with a hidden agenda...the "cat and mouse" of this book should have been great, but sadly it falls short.  In my opinion, Ripley's Game is the best of the Ripley sequels - this one doesn't even come close.. 
 Telling people how to perform ceremonies that they have no qualifications for or experience in is sacrelidgeous. Period. Anyone who practices or performs these ceremonies (who hasn't cashed in on their ancestry for twenty bucks a pop) knows this. I have done extensive research on this kind of cultural misappropriation (Ward Churchill has, among many others, an excellent book called Indians Are Us? that contains an essay on Mr. McGaa and other "plastic medicine men"). The person who stated the fact that this book is sacrelidgeous is not close-minded, he or she is aware of the facts. You cannot claim part of someone else's religion for your own 
 _____________________________________________ Picked this up on a whim, and it was disappointing. I didn't finish it -- the book is repetitious and surprisingly dull, considering what a good writer Kate Wilhelm is. Though there are moments. Likely to be of more interest to Clarion alums and aspiring students. For others, caveat lector.  Sadly, Peter D. Tillman 
 I'm very disappointed with this book.  It touches on some concepts that could be useful but there is absolutely nothing in this book a PHP programmer can put to use right away.  I've built several web sites using PHP/MySQL and there is not one single thing in this book useful to me.  The book is mainly a survey of concepts, NOT an advanced programming guide.  Nothing in this book is fleshed out completely enough to actually begin using it in programming your website.   If you want to actually use any of the ideas in the book, you will have to find a better source of information and documentation for the particular idea or technology.  For example, the book has a decent introduction to the Smarty template system but not enough info to actually start using it effectively.  There are no performance or feature comparisons between Smarty and other template systems so I'm not even sure how you're supposed to decide if Smarty is right for you (the author merely mentions that Smarty is popular, not why you should or should not use Smarty).  Another example: the book talks about three different load generators and gives examples of their use (about 1.5 pages each) but definitely not enough details to begin using any of them.  The only thing of value I got from this book is a conceptual understanding of reverse proxies.  Of course, if you actually want to implement a reverse proxy yourself, you're going to need a lot more information than you'll find in this book.  I gave this book two stars instead of one because it is a halfway decent survey.  The title, however, is totally inappropriate.  It has nothing to do with advanced PHP programming.  Instead, the title should be, "Shallow Survey of Concepts and Tools Related to PHP and Web Development" 
 This book is several things.  One thing it is NOT is funny.  Blount  worries that, having attained the age of 55, he is experiencing some sort  of humorist's change of life and is no longer capable of evoking guffaws.   Well, then, this book is a self-fulfilling prophesy.  In the process, we  get to squirm through such incessent dissing of his mother that we want to  turn our heads in embarrassment; so much what-did-I-do-wrong whining about  lost loves that we're inclined to "card" him to see if he's  really past 15; and yet more tired and feeble attempts at what, I suppose,  is to pass for "Southern humor."  If this is the best we're to  expect from Blount as he flounders through middle age, he ought to confine  himself to his periodic appearances with Garrison Keillor, reading jokes  sent in by people who know what "funny" really is 
 I recently bought this DVD and was extremely disappointed.  The sound and light quality were both awful.  The band was totally uninspired.  This live effort pales dramatically next to "Live at Budakon."  The voices are worn out, the energy is gone.  It's out of tune and the audience is minimally involved.  After watching it once - it's off to the dust bin!  (For a much better live concert - try Queen live at Wembley, Styx return to paradise - or even Journey 2001 
 ...than finish this book.  I gave up half-way through. Great premise, lousy execution 
 The problem with the "classics" is that too many hacks have hacked them to pieces. My opinion of these recordings, for whatever it is worth, is that they simply do not do justice to Strauss's magnificent music.  There is a reason they are a "bargain". I would avoid this set. Sometimes a boxed set is a good deal, but this one is not. I find the entire set unspeakably dull and literally unlistenable.   In any event, this is merely my opinion. The majority of the other reviewers think its terrific.     
 I have to admit that this was a required book for a college course I took on art and criminality, most of the required books I found interesting, but this was very boring and silly. I didn't like how the book had a modern tone and yet is obviously set in a past time. It is hard to imagine the Vegas they describe to a younger reader. Also the drug culture that is talked about profusly in the book is both boring and pointless. I think you would have to be interested in the drug sub culture to like this book and that is something I am not. Maybe this book is interesting to a certain type of reader, but I found it more or a nuissance than a pleasure 
 Well, this game is fun but I can't believe some people thought that it would actually take you into space! Well, Its kinda stupid you just take apart a house puzzle according to some stupid card. But still, the game is really fun. --- Delane 
 I was extremely disappointed in this item. I think it is a good concept, but it doesn't work well at all.  it says on the back that you have to take big sips for it to register that you are really drinking it.  I tried to really take big sips and it would barely register that I drank anything.  it is awkward to drink from too.  I can not believe this thing was really tested out by people before it went on the market.  not worth buying.  just buy a regular water bottle for a fraction of the cost and save yourself the aggravation 
 I am a teacher in Colorado. Being interested in new ways to stimulate my students and inspire them to learn, I picked up this book. Although its message sounds good, it is in fact impractical and impossible to apply to the classroom without losing control of the students. It is obvious that the author made up many, if not all of these stories about his successes, because he is obviously a failed teacher. I pity all of the students he has taught 
 as mentioned before, the track "Message to the Queen" is a ripoff from the Macedonian song "Zajdi Zajdi". If he noted the original song as inspiration, it would be cool, but he signed it as his own. Poor taste, so I'm actually skipping this album. 
 This book can be summarized in about 3 sentences:  1.  Don't be egocentric.  2.  Don't be mean.  3.  Don't be dumb.  I'm very sorry I wasted the money on this, and even more sorry that some of the money will go to Ben Stein.  
 I was tipped off to Wishbone Ash from an article I read about Steve Harris (Iron Maiden) who credited this band as being one of his earliest and biggest influences.  I bought their self titled debut album and this one from Amazon based on that article and also because both of these albums were well received by reviewers.  Maybe I read too much into the article or perhaps this was just another spur of the moment purchase, but I think these albums would better suit 1970's rock fans per se i.e. a fan of the period than those who prefer the harder style of rock that would emerge from the mid to late 1970's.  The album does have its moments, and there are some really nice melodies and some nice guitar/bass work, but it too often drifts into that very early "happy happy" 1970's sound that marked the transition from the 1960s to the 1970's.  I guess that should be expected, since this album was released only two years into the turbulent new decade at the close of the flower power hippie period.  The use of the twin guitars a noteworthy feature, since this band is also credited as an early pioneer of this style of rock.  The bass is unusually active for this period and doesn't just settle for simple changes, which would make sense, since they did influence Steve Harris after all.  I prefer this album to their debut, but it does make me think of an English version of the Eagles if there ever was such a thing.  Not that that is a bad thing.  I am a fan of 1970's rock and I think this decade produced some fantastic guitar/bass rock, but this is just a little too 70's for my tastes.  If you are new to Wishbone Ash as I am, but are basically a hard rock/metal fan at heart, try looking for MP3 versions on the web and just test drive one or two songs before you decide on buying a complete album.  
 I think this book must be able to hit someone well. I think if your just starting out, Christian and sort of interested in unschooling this might be a good book for you. Unfortunatly for me I have been homeschooling awhile and found this book a waste of my time. I don't like how they tell you to be wary of curriculum companies and people trying to sell you things but in the next sentence they are pushing "their way" on you. A little two faced for me. But I did walk away with some good information so it wasn't a total waste. I have read worse books on homeschooling that is for sure 
 I have to agree with the librarian, this book is packaged like a book for small children, but reads like a book for older school aged children and adults.  My kids did not see the humor, even after I tried to explain it to them, they just thought the pictures were scary and sad.  I frankly found the story a little past creative and venturing in disturbing 
 This is another CD that will make a fine drink coaster. I know that Pink Floyds recordings are bizzare but in my opinion this disk was one waste of money that I should have avoided 
 The first thing that you'll notice is that this is a skimpy, short book at 134 pages (160 if you include the appendices).  This would be ok if the content was substantial and useful.  Unfortunately, it provides a very introductory, shallow overview of the covered call writing strategy.  This too would be ok if this was a $15 quick read paperback, but it's an expensive hardcover (which is not worth the price).  I'd suggest the interested reader should check other books on the subject instead 
 Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him 
 I was really disappointed in this book.  I had heard such rave reviews but it definitely was a book I struggled through and only finished since I bought it new and kept thinking I would find something redeeming in it 
 This book by Timothy White is a shallow delve into the life of reggae legend Bob Marley. The book promises to deliver on details of his early life, his rise to stardom, and his death in the crushing grip of cancer. However, Mr. White spends far too much time on the small and irrelevant details of Marley's early years and leaves the reader wanting more and getting less. The book progresses with minor details loosely strung together with trival information and little 'meat' in the scope of the life of one of the most influential musicians of all time. Overall, I would have to say that this is one of the worst books about Marley that I have ever read and I think that though he began with good intentions, Mr. Timothy White did not deliver on his promises to fulfill the reader with knowledge about the life of Bob Marley 
 This has be one of the worst movies ever made. The prolonged slow motion fighting scenes, the sentimental music, the pathetic apperance of Anthony Hopkins playing the cliched older wise man. All these things combined produce strong vomit reflexes in my gut. When Tom Cruise and his enemy charge at each other as in a joust on motorcycles and then leap off them to land on top of each other the unintentional guy on guy action oozes all over the screen. And when the movie ends with children carrying baloons i know that i have wasted precious timw with this garbage.unfortunatley metallica sells out and lends their music to this dud 
 This book did not give a description of all supplaments I was looking for.  The buying guide was good but I wanted a complete vitamin supplament listin 
 I read Shamdasani's book together with the two books by Richard Noll. When you compare the books, it is clear that Noll's scholarship is thorough, devestating to Jung, and convincing. Shamdasani's book, which at 144 pages  is actually more of a pamphlet, is a strange, mean-spirited, attack on Noll  that borders on the personal. It is an odd book that seems to have been  written in a jealous rage. Obviously Noll is the more talented scholar, and  Shamdasani wastes his arguments on trying to undermine Noll without  offering anything new and convincing. It is not surprising that this book  has not been reviewed by serious publications, as Noll's have. Thank  goodness I did not buy this book, but read it in one long sitting in the  cafe at Borders. Shamdasani's book is a waste of time and money. Don't buy  it 
 I allready put up 2 reviews and I don't appreciate them being taken off by amazon because I highly believe that this book is BADDDDDD!  Amazon I know your trying to sell as many books as possible but you ever hear of a thing called free speech?? If your gonna only post positive reviews then don't bother even having people put up what they think about the books.  Geoff Houston might be a smart guy and all but this book??, my god what was he thinking writing something that puts people asleep every single line of his text?  Overall a BAD book, do not recommend to anyone 
 Hank is an idiot.  He caters to the ignorant who want some fancy desciptions to help them feel comfortable deepening their ignorance.  Hank hampers truth 
 The only reason I wanted this CD is for Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata. However March of the Toreadors immediately follows it. I see that it was arranged in alphabetical order but I wonder if it wasn't also a cruel joke. I now am conditioned to have my nerves jolted every time I put in the CD and listen to the Moonlight Sonata 
 It is claimed that the Bush administration is loaded with neo-conservatives, supposedly followers of Strauss, who is known as the preeminent natural rights philosopher. So, do natural rights have a thing to do with their policies? First one must find out what a natural right is.  Alas, one turns to Strauss' basic work on the subject. My hat goes off to anyone who can figure out what a natural right is if they have the perseverance to wade through this book. "Obscure" hardly does justice to the convoluted, indecipherable writing of the author. In lieu of clearly outlining a coherent theory of natural rights, the author is most intent on skewering historicists, followers of Max Weber, modern liberals, and others who rely on what men have come to understand about society and thereby fashioned rights.  The idea of a natural right is bizarre anyway. The biological imperative to survive in nature is hardly a right. It's hard to see civilized society being built on the workings of raw nature: the utter harshness would have to be overcome. However, once two or more men come to agreement on behavior and rights, that agreement is relative to them and is not natural, though it may be practical or wise. Of course, the author disdains positive law, or man-made law. The idea that reasonable and self-moderating behavior is pre-social is pure delusion.  But it is interesting to see the dynamics of power with a good mixture of propaganda and ignorance being purified by subtly suggesting that those machinations are connected to philosophies of natural rights. That thinking is at least as obscure as the master's work. 
 I ordered this item... it doesn't say anywhere on the page that is is used.   Amazon chose to have Target supply this item and when they shipped it, the return label says TARGET RETURNS DEPT and the item has dirt on it, scuffs, rust, etc. It was obviously returned to a Target retail store and Target sent it out as a new item with a new plastic bag around it.  I am extremely disappointed in Amazon for using outside suppliers they have no control over and allowing something like this to happen. It's so much trouble to have to repack an item, get a RMA# and send back for credit.  JUNK! Is Amazon a flea market now? 
 This DVD contains six rounds. The questions are the same everytime you play that round. So once you've played one of the rounds, you know all the answers. For the price, that sux. I expected different random questions every game, not so. I bought this game because it's packaged like it's a rock based game. (Guy with the Les Paul guitar on the front of the box, Lollapalooza sample question on back, and it comes with a Hard Rock Cafe poster which the box for the game has their logo all over it) so I bite. Then the game has questions about country artist Clay Aiken and the rapper 50 Cents. What's up with that? Plus the game's main theme music is C+C Music Factory's "Gonna Make You Sweat". It was still rather enjoyable, except the DVD kept freezing up. So overall, avoid it unless you can find it for five bucks or less!!
